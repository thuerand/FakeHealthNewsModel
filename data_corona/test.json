Doctors didn\u2019t believe there was much chance for survival, but the man and his family never gave up hope.\nAfter 21 days on a ventilator, Joey Collum was wheeled out of a Hattiesburg hospital.\n\u201cLord. I don\u2019t even know how to put that into words,\u201d Collum said. \u201cI knew then I was way more blessed than I ever thought I was.\u201d\nEmergency responders escorted Collum and his wife Datia from the hospital to their church where a welcome committee awaited.\n\u201cThey had their sirens going down the highway and he was just crying. He was just crying. Because he made it. He made it,\u201d Datia said.\nDatia says, according to doctors, the odds were against him. The 62-year-old Mississippi man has pre-existing conditions and hadn't fully recovered from a recent bout in the hospital.\n\"The doctors weren't giving me a whole lot of hope. They were already basically preparing me for the worst,\" Datia explained. \"The virus just basically tore his lungs up.\"\nJoey first showed symptoms, March 22. By the 27, he was in the hospital with pneumonia. The next day, Joey\u2019s test came back positive for COVID-19. His condition had deteriorated and he was flown to a hospital in Hattiesburg where he only got worse.\n\u201cHe was in such bad condition. I got the phone call after they intubated him which means that the last time I talked to him would\u2019ve been the last time that I talked to him had anything happened. So, I was just feeling a little lost,\u201d Datia choked back tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nWhen doctors put Joey on a ventilator, Datia did research on mortality rates for COVID patients, looking for hope but finding very little.\nA new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association indicates nine out of 10 COVID patients put on ventilators do not survive. The study examined the outcomes of 2,600 patients in the New York City area.\nDoctors say, the longer a patient is on one, the less chance for survival. Ventilators help a patient breathe but do not offer a solution. They solely provide support until the body is well enough to breathe on its own or until other treatments prove successful.\n\"It was scary. It was really scary because he almost didn't make it,\" Datia said.\nFor days, Datia waited for good news, but it didn't come. She tried to stay busy and stay strong for her family. Oftentimes, Datia says she found herself outside, singing and talking to her God.\n\"If it was his time to go, then God knows better than me what plan he had. I was able to keep my faith just because of the relationship I have with God and that he has our best interest in mind and I just had to trust him and believe that,\" explained Datia.\nIt wasn't. Joey began to improve and doctors took him off a ventilator.\n\u201c21 days. I didn\u2019t even know I was alive,\u201d Joey said.\nOnce Joey awoke from sedation and started responding, Datia knew her husband would recover.\n\"It was a very weak and a very frail voice but he told me he loved me and it was perfect. It might've been weak but it was perfect,\" recalled Datia.\nStill celebrating but exhausted from the homecoming, the Collums believe it would have never happened without their faith.\n\u201cWe had a lot of people praying and so I really believe that those prayers were heard,\u201d Datia said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s home.\u201d\n\"I know my God never let my hand go,\" Joey said.\nJoey is still recovering. He doesn\u2019t have his voice back, completely, and there are sores on his face from the glue that held the intubation tube in place.\nCopyright 2020 WVUE. All rights reserved.",

He said the country will have to prepare for dengue and Covid-19 cases when the monsoon sets in.\n\u201cSoutheast Asians are well protected hereditarily and have developed strong and powerful genes to fight against vector-borne viral diseases. They are exposed to various blood sucking insects, especially mosquitoes, unlike those in continents like Europe or Americas, which help them develop immunity against several viral diseases,\u201d Dr Mariappan told TOI. He said India had little trouble during the SARS outbreak. According to a newsletter published by National Institute of Communicable Diseases, till April 9, 2003, no SARS cases were reported in India but other countries had a vast number of them by then. The virus causing Covid-19, SARS CoV-2, is from the same family of viruses.\n\u201cFood habits play a part in ensuring we are protected from certain diseases. In South India, we keep \u2018rasam\u2019 in our diet. Its ingredients like garlic, pepper and bellary, which has anti-oxidants, protect lungs. Notably, the number of deaths compared to number of cases is much less in Tamil Nadu and India,\u201d said Dr Mariappan. He said geographical location plays a role when it comes to number of cases, observing that districts like Nagapattinam and Ramanathapuram, which are close to the shore and have scattered population are likely to have less number of Covid-19 cases. Areas with dense population would have more cases as there is more chance of Covid-19 spreading through contact.\nThe scientist said in future, there could be a possibility of having to tackle dengue and Covid-19 cases at the same time. \u201cSo far, no vaccine has been developed to fight dengue as well. With rains already starting in many parts, dengue cases will come up. The onus is on the individual to practise hygiene and stay safe,\u201d said Dr Mariappan.\nDownload The Times of India News App for Latest City News\nSubscribe Start Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!

One comment from someone in January.\n\nOf course, the leftist blogs didn\u2019t actually read beyond the headline, instead concocting their own posts proclaiming that Trump pressured intelligence officials to blame the Wuhan lab, according to the New York Times. Meanwhile, US intelligence issued a statement saying that American agencies are still investigating the lab leak theory, while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo again reiterated that the Communist Chinese government is refusing to allow the US access to the facilities.\n\nAt the same time China, which continues to claim that the virus was intentionally released by the US military, suggested that the US has a \u2018history of bacteriological warfare\u2019.\n\nA propaganda piece in China\u2019s state newspaper China Daily falsely claimed that the United States used biological weapons during the Korean War.\n\n\u201c[T]he media outlets that prop up a blame game by the world\u2019s single hegemonic power are forgetting that it was the U.S. that is alleged to have engaged in bacteriological warfare against Korean and Chinese soldiers during the Korean War (1950-53) and against the Vietnamese (1955-75),\u201d Rod P.

The number of new cases rose from 618 reported on Saturday.\nThe vast majority of the new cases are migrant workers living in dormitories, the health ministry said in the statement. Fifteen of the new cases are permanent residents.\nSingapore now has one of the highest infection rates in Asia, according to official figures, due to outbreaks in cramped dormitories housing over 300,000 mainly South Asian workers.\nThe first patients, mainly from Bangladesh and India, were moved on Saturday into the vast conference hall, partitioned into rooms for eight to 10 people, with metal beds, plastic storage drawers and fans.\nSingapore trails only China, India, Japan and Pakistan in Asia for the number of coronavirus infections. More than 10,000 of those infected, some 80% of its total, are foreign workers, many of whom have been placed in \u201cisolation facilities\u201d for people with mild symptoms such as the conference centers.\nDespite the high total of cases, Singapore has reported 12 deaths and 24 people are in intensive care.\nSingapore\u2019s young overseas laborers, earning as little as $15 a day, live in dormitories with bunk-bed accommodation in areas little visited by tourists to the modern city-state. Many are under government-ordered quarantines due to mass outbreaks, with workers left inside battling a constant fear of catching the virus.\nAt the new Changi isolation center, each room has blood-pressure monitors and other medical equipment for patients to conduct their own health checks three times daily, while remote-controlled robots provide meals and teleconferencing services to reduce contact.\nAuthorities are also trialing a four-legged robot dog built by Boston Dynamics at the facility, which they said could be used to deliver medicines to patients or take their temperature.\nThe indoor space can house 2,700 patients, while an ongoing outdoor extension will add another 1,700 beds. A nearby conference center called EXPO is already housing hundreds of COVID-19 patients.\nAround 10,000 healthy workers in essential services have been moved from dormitories into alternative housing, including military camps, converted sports halls and accommodation ships for offshore workers, authorities say.\nRows of white huts are also being hurriedly assembled at the Tanjong Pagar shipping-container port. The facility could house up to 15,000 foreign workers, local media reported, but authorities have yet to decide how it will be used.\n\u201cWe are continuing to explore additional space for various reasons, including facilities for suspect cases or infected workers, and also for workers who are recovering or who have fully recovered,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Ministry of National Development said in an emailed statement, adding that the Tanjong Pagar site was part of that plan.",

Restaurants and theaters were given the go-ahead three days later.\n\nThe same goes for other states, because, although the NYT has repeatedly pointed out that, when backing out the data from the Greater NY area, the curve still appears to be gradually steepening, and even though Texas reported a \u201crecord\u201d daily jump in deaths on Thursday (data reported with a 24 hour delay), in reality, the number of cases and states remains relatively low per capita, and there are still counties across the midwest, south and mountain west haven\u2019t reported a single case or death.\n\nSome have attributed a recent bump in some of the less-impacted areas to an improvement in the availability of testing.\n\nTo be sure, as BBG explains, it\u2019s too early to declare \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d. Georgia has suffered a lot, but even as hospitalizations and the spread slow, a new \u201chot spot\u201d of cases has emerged north of Atlanta, and the risk of spread remains moderate.\n\nBut one thing is clear: A few weeks ago, the mayor of Atlanta, and several other Democratic mayors of the state\u2019s largest cities, slammed Kemp and implied that he was putting lives at risk for the sake of the president\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nAt the time, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d and \u201cextremely concerned\u201d by the decision.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Just as Kemp expected, most businesses didn\u2019t reopen right away. Indeed, three weeks in, some small businesses and even some chains have yet to reopen (most Apple stores in the US remain closed, for example, though five stores have reopened, one of which is in South Carolina).

BHUBANESWAR: With three new positive cases detected in Sundargarh district on Sunday total Covid-19 tally spiked to 103 in Odisha. The new patients included two men- a 23-year and a 60-year old, and a 57-year old woman. All three are close contacts of a person, who had tested positive earlier, revealed health and family welfare department.\nSundargarh district has reported a total six positive cases so far. However, on Saturday the government had announced three infected persons as recovered. Now the detection of three new cases on Sunday has left the administration worried. Following the new cases Rourkela Municipal Corporation declared Nala Road in Rourkela as \u2018highly sensitive\u2019 containment zone and asked people not to venture out from their homes, said Sundargarh collector Nikhil Pawan Kalyan.\nThe first Covid-19 positive cases in Bisra area of Sundargarh were detected on April 11. The duo, a 67 year-old man who had visited Nizamuddin and an 18-year-old boy who had come in contact with a Nizamuddin returnee. The third positive case was reported on April 20, who was a contact of the earlier patients.\nMeanwhile, the state government on Sunday relaxed 60-hour long shutdown imposed in Balasore, Bhadrak and Jajpur districts but increased containment zones in places from where new cases detected. The three districts witnessed spurt in Covid-19 cases with 17 infected cases in Jajpur, 14 patients in Bhadrak and ten patients in Balasore.\nWith six new positive cases detected from Jajpur district on Saturday the district administration announced complete shutdown in five blocks including Jajpur, Dasrathpur, Binjharpur, Korei and Bari and Jajpur municipality area from 12 noon of April 27 to 6 pm of April 29. The whole area will be under active surveillance and samples will be collected and except medicine stores everything will remain closed. All the six contracted persons had returned from Kolkata.\nEven though Bhadrak district collector Gyana Das asked people not to rush to markets and crowd shops after lifting of the shutdown as there is ample stock of essential items and vegetables, large number of people thronged markets in the district to buy essentials and vegetables.\nDuring the shutdown, the administration in the three districts continued organised many testing camps in schools and collected over 3,000 samples.\nMeanwhile, a Covid-19 positive case of Bhubaneswar who was under treatment at AIIMS has recovered and tested negative on Sunday. He is under treatment for his other chronic health conditions and will be discharged after his recovery from the other health issues, twitted health and family welfare department. With this of the total 46 cases in Bhubaneswar, 23 cases recovered and 22 are active with one death. No positive cases detected from the capital city, a major hotspot, for the last 11 days",

With industries laid waste, countries shuttered and hundreds of thousands of lives lost, the world we all knew has dramatically altered and as we begin cautiously to re-emerge after self-imposed isolation, we are all seeking markers of reassurance, comfort and stability.\nWelsh history gave Alexander McQueen its warrior women for autumn / winter 2020. Courtesy McQueen Moving forward, will we crave a return to the decadent hedonism of maximalism? It may be gaudy, indulgent and over the top, but it is ultimately about celebration, about joy and embracing the sheer expressiveness of fashion.\nIt can be expressed in many ways. Who hasn\u2019t felt the thrill of pulling on a new dress, or unearthing a gilded find at a thrift shop? Who hasn\u2019t longed for something from our grandmother's wardrobe or looked forward to the day we can borrow our mother's vintage boots? And such giddy longing does not make one greedy. Far from it. The thrill of the chase, taking joy and enjoying a moment, are all vital parts of the human condition.\nSingers Lady Gaga and Harry Styles, actor Jared Leto and Madonna have all dedicated themselves to being modern-day Lounge Lizards, in preposterous make-up, high-waisted flares and velvet capes, embracing the sheer joy of being alive.\nFor Gucci autumn / winter 2020, ruffles were restrained with puritanical hats. Courtesy Gucci But even before Covid-19, the ever-faster fashion merry-go-round was drawing complaints that it moved too quickly, burning too fast through designers and precious resources.\nIn a recent interview with Vogue , Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele said: \u201cI hope we will never go back to that 'normal'. Because the life we lived before has been fearfully unsustainable. So, yes, we will go back to life. But, I hope, to a different life.\u201d\nWhen we finally emerge from our cocoons, will we yearn for the spartan purity of pared-back designers such as Jil Sander and Helmut Lang, whose severity of line better fits the present mood? Or will we want to celebrate, indulge, and announce that we are one of the lucky survivors?\nThe autumn / winter 2020 collections, which were unveiled just as Covid-19 was starting to spread its full, destructive power, were filled with clothes that spoke of practicality, of utility, of \"hunkering down\" instead of excess and exhibitionism.\nA nightmare scenario at Balenciaga for autumn / winter 2020. Balenciaga, for example, gave us clothes for an apocalypse, shown on a flooded runway and under an end-of-days sky, while Marine Serre continued what she had begun so joltingly for spring / summer 2020 (that took place in September 2019) with face masks in what now feels like chilling foresight.\nOr how about Prada, with its belted practicality? Simple garb \u2013 almost nun like in its simplicity \u2013 in stoic grey and tightly held with thick leather belts. Or Alexander McQueen who looked to the folklore of ancient Wales to create clothes for modern warrior women.\nRead More #WhoMadeMyClothes: Which brands top the 2020 fashion transparency index, and which scored zero?\nMoody sculptures to side-eyeing prints: Are these the world's sassiest artworks?\nEven Louis Vuitton looked back in time, to deliver a collection of space-age history, mixing ruffles of old with technical fabrics.\nAt Gucci, it, too, was about less. More fancy ruffles were heaped into skirts, but then added to sparse tops, and Puritan hats, that gave it all an air of restraint.\nHindsight is 20/20, as they say, and it is fascinating to reflect on collections unveiled so recently with new perspective, and see that the signs were already there.\nWe were already beginning to turn away from the glory days of the maximum, shift away from the endless \"new\", and instead, turn towards a sense of \"make do\" and \u2018re-wear\u2019. It was already happening. It just took a pandemic for us to see it.\nUpdated: April 26, 2020 07:38 PM",

        "content": "First Opinion Adolescents and young adults are paying a high price for Covid-19 prevention By Lisa Jacobs\nApril 27, 2020\nStudents pack up and move out of their dorm at the University of Michigan on March 17 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Gregory Shamus/Getty Images\n\u201cH ow can he be so stupid?\u201d a dad asked me in a telehealth visit. His voice shook with fear and rage as he described his adolescent son sneaking out to meet friends against legal and family orders to stay at home.\nAs a child psychiatrist, I\u2019ve been fielding many such calls.\n\u201cWhat if he\u2019s not stupid?\u201d I asked. Youths who ignore orders to shelter in place are cast as insensitive, short sighted, and foolish by media and politicians . But what if adults are missing their logic? What if adolescents and young adults are actually acting according to the American ideals of self-interest and self-sufficiency that have been modeled for them?\nadvertisement\nLeadership happens by example. Lawmakers and other adults have set very poor examples about acting selflessly to protect vulnerable populations. When nearly 8,000 Americans aged 24 and younger died from gun violence in 2018, youths\u2019 pleas for gun control fell on deaf ears. After nearly 11,000 young American lives were lost to suicide and drug overdoses in 2018, mental health and substance abuse treatment has remained limited and difficult to access. Efforts to reduce climate change, despite urgent pleas to do so , have been sparse.\nRelated: It was my job to call people whose Covid-19 tests were positive. That taught me a lot about medicine, the law, and society Should young Americans now be asked to protect the older adults who failed to protect them? Is that fair?\nadvertisement\nIf adults expect adolescents and young adults to act in ways we have not demonstrated and modeled for them, we are the stupid and selfish ones. Lawmakers are demanding enormous sacrifices from young Americans: their educations, their social lives, and sometimes their safety, as many of the 1 million abused and neglected American kids are now isolated at home with their abusers, with no plan to ensure their safety.\nYoung people have low odds of dying from Covid-19. As I write this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 25 Americans aged 24 or younger have died of Covid-19 in 2020, or 0.1% of the lives claimed by suicide and unintentional drug overdoses in this age group in 2018. (For comparison, 477 children and adolescents under age 17 in the United States died of influenza in the 2018-2019 flu season.)\nNo graduations. No sports. No time with friends. Lonely teenagers are more likely to become depressed, obese, and unhealthy adults. Social isolation in childhood is linked to poor health, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity in adulthood. Even in good times, about 8% of American teens try to kill themselves each year and about 70% suffer from loneliness. In 2020, these numbers will likely be higher .\nIs it shocking that some young people see social isolation measures as a more deadly threat than Covid-19? Is it rational?\nOur medical system\u2019s insufficient capacity to treat Covid-19 patients is a crisis that needs urgent intervention. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve brushed aside the same medical system\u2019s insufficient capacity to treat the issues threatening the lives of America\u2019s youths for years.\nRationing health care \u2014 an issue now in the news in the Covid-19 era \u2014 is something I was tasked to do from my first day as a psychiatrist. There were never enough beds in the psychiatric units for young people at risk of death from suicide or addiction. Now, as the need for mental health treatment rises, the pandemic has forced hospitals to further reduce their capacity to treat mental health issues.\nAll of the teens and young adults I treat have made valiant efforts to isolate themselves to protect others, even knowing that they are extremely unlikely to die from Covid-19. For the first two weeks, they did well. Now they are suffering. Some hit their limits and can\u2019t do it anymore. More teens and young adults tell me this with each passing week. Their restlessness and boredom have morphed into depression, anxiety, and anger.\nNewsletters Sign up for First Opinion A weekly digest of our opinion column, with insight from industry experts.\nPlease enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human: Is anyone considering them in deciding how our country moves forward? Is anyone thanking them for their selfless sacrifices?\nQuite the opposite. They are shamed in the rare instances when they can\u2019t, or refuse to, sacrifice their own well-being for the greater good. They are shamed for acting like teenagers \u2014 and for acting American.\nYouths lack voting and spending power, so their voices don\u2019t get heard. I am writing on their behalf because their perspectives matter. They will inherit the leadership of our troubled society and we are foolish not to prioritize their well-being.\nWhile social isolation is necessary to reduce deaths and to keep hospitals functioning, I believe a more nuanced and sophisticated discussion of the risks and benefits to key groups is warranted. If we want our children and teens to help protect us, we must protect them first.\nLisa Jacobs, M.D., is a child, adolescent, and adult psychiatrist in Menlo Park, Calif., the assistant director of The Pegasus Physician Writers at Stanford , and editor at large of The Pegasus Review .",

        "content": "The outbreak of COVID-19 at a restaurant in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou was a puzzle.\nThe suspected index patient was a visitor from the coronavirus\u2019s epicentre in Wuhan. But the eight other customers who later tested positive were not sitting close enough for droplet transmission, and most of the patrons and staff avoided infection altogether.\nA team of local scientists eventually came to an eye-opening conclusion about the episode: tiny particles of virus had hitched a ride on currents created by the eatery\u2019s air-conditioning.\nFor a group of civil engineers at the University of Alberta, the finding was no surprise. In their world, they say, it\u2019s well known that building ventilation systems are efficient discriminators of virus and other pathogens, and believe the COVID-19 bug is no exception.\nAided by a $440,000 federal-government grant , they\u2019re now working on ways that buildings could change their HVAC set-ups to curb the risk of infection, what the researchers call a \u201cnon-pharmaceutical\u201d intervention against the disease.\nWe want to save lives, let\u2019s cut right to the chase\n\u201cWe want to save lives, let\u2019s cut right to the chase,\u201d said Prof. Brian Fleck, part of the project. \u201cThere are so many, many, many buildings \u2026 This effects absolutely everybody. Billions of people. If we are able to cut down the transmission rate by a per cent, that\u2019s a lot of people.\u201d\nThe engineers\u2019 belief in the importance of building ventilation as a transmitter of the COVID-19 virus is not universally held.\nThe World Health Organization and other public-health bodies , citing the science to date, say the pathogen is spread almost entirely by droplets, heavier particles emitted mostly when infected people cough or sneeze, and which fall down within a short distance. Hence the two-metre rule for social distancing.\n\u201cThe HVAC systems in most non-medical buildings play only a small role in infectious disease transmission, including COVID-19,\u201d argued the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers last month.\nBut Chinese and Australian air-quality experts, citing in part the experience with SARS, another coronavirus, argued in a paper earlier this month that as droplets from an infected person start to evaporate, the resulting smaller particles can indeed become airborne.\nThey point to evidence that passengers confined to their cabins on cruise ships like the Diamond Princess were infected through the vessels\u2019 air ducts.\n\u201cIt is highly likely that the SARS-CoV-2 virus also spreads by air,\u201d they conclude, urging \u201call possible\u201d action in response, including modifications to ventilation systems. \u201cWe predict that \u2026 failure to immediately recognize and acknowledge the importance of airborne transmission and to take adequate actions against it will result in additional cases.\u201d\nThen there was the Guangzhou restaurant case, detailed in a U.S. Centers for Disease Control online journal recently. Researchers concluded flow from an air conditioner moved over three tables, carrying virus from the infected patron at the middle one to the far table, then back to the diners closest to the air conditioner.\nHeating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) engineers have long known that tiny particles of pathogen can be carried in the air that is circulated, heated and cooled in modern buildings, said Fleck. He pointed to Legionnaires disease, a bacterial pneumonia first traced to a hotel\u2019s air-conditioning system.\nThe particle can stay airborne long enough to go all the way through the system and then pop out in somebody else\u2019s office\n\u201cThis has been on people\u2019s radar for quite a while,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody on a different floor sneezes \u2026The particle can stay airborne long enough to go all the way through the system and then pop out in somebody else\u2019s office.\u201d\nThere are various ways that risk can be lessened, including use of filters that catch a greater number of those particles, and drawing more fresh air into a system. It also is likely that higher levels of humidity \u2013 a factor that only some Canadian buildings can adjust \u2013 will help kill off the virus, said Fleck.\nBut each of those changes carries a cost. Adding more fresh air can require additional heat or air conditioning. Heavier filters means more energy is needed to push the air through them. And more humidity can lead to mould, he noted.\n\u201cThis will make for difficult decision making.\u201d\nFunded by the Canadian Institute for Health Research, the University of Alberta project is led by engineering professor Lexuan Zhong and also involves pediatrics professor Lisa Hartling. It consists of three phases: systematically reviewing literature on air circulation and viruses, determining what strategies would be effective and then carrying out a detailed audit of all the buildings on the Edmonton campus to create a real-world model of what should be done.\nThe team hopes to have solid results by the summer of 2021, said Fleck.\nCopyright Postmedia Network Inc., 2020 Commenting is not available for this article.

        "content": "Hongkongers are playing video games more than ever due to being stuck at home under the city\u2019s Covid-19 social-distancing rules , but they are also spending less money on them given their pessimism about the economy, according to local gaming companies.\nDespite the growth in terms of players, revenue at some local companies has dropped 5% to 15% since the pandemic\u2019s outbreak . That stands in contrast to the global market, which has seen growth in both, two members of the Hong Kong Game Industry Association (HKGIA) said recently.\n\u201cDuring the time of Sars [severe acute respiratory syndrome] in 2003, the number of players and revenues increased by 30% to 40%. But what is special about this outbreak is that it has made many people pessimistic about the future of the economy,\u201d said Jack Lai, chairman of the HKGIA and manager of Chinesegamer International (Hong Kong).\n\u201cIn this outbreak , many people are afraid of losing their jobs, so it is safer to keep their money in their pockets and try not to spend it on luxuries. I think the business model for our games is very similar to the models for watches or jewellery, which requires spare money.\n\u201cShowing off a piece of virtual equipment in a game and showing off a luxurious watch in the real world are the same, and the willingness to show off and spend money is not as strong when players have no confidence in the economy.\u201d\nMany online games allow players to enhance their experience by paying real-world dollars to access additional content, boost in-game abilities or make cosmetic improvements to online characters.\nBased on exchanges with peers at other companies, Lai estimated overall downloads were up 10% to 20%, while overall revenues were down 5% to 15%, compared with data before the pandemic.\nHKGIA has 34 member companies, whose revenues account for 60% to 70% of the market share, according to Lai.\nThe revenues at his company have fallen 20% to 30% due to the pandemic, Lai added.\nThe scene in Hong Kong stands in sharp contrast with the global scene, where gaming revenues and downloads are growing. Mobile game downloads rose 20% globally in the first quarter of 2020 compared with the same period last year, and consumers spent more than US$6.7bil (RM29.20bil) on mobile gaming in the quarter, 5% higher than the three months prior, data from the app analytics firm App Annie shows.\nThere are two main factors contributing to the drop in revenue in Hong Kong, according to Lai \u2013 the overall economic downturn and the postponement of new game releases.\nSince many mobile and online games are free to play, many players have no incentive to spend on in-game upgrades, said Sze Lingling, chief operations officer of Gameone Group, one of the largest gaming companies in Hong Kong and an HKGIA member.\n\u201cNowadays people just use games to kill time ... they can get a game and play for a long time,\u201d she said.\nThe postponement of new releases amid the pandemic has also impacted gaming company revenues.\nChinesegamer International\u2019s new mobile game Heroes Of Huang Yi , based on martial arts-themed stories by Hong Kong novelist Wong Cho-keung, was expected to be released in February or March, but was postponed until June.\nLarge-scale promotional activities and exhibitions, which account for about half of the company\u2019s publicity plans, are impossible during the pandemic, he said.\nGameone\u2019s new game The Ravages Of Time , adapted from a comic series by Hong Kong artist Chen Mau, has also been postponed until August.\nAccording to the PayPal 2018 Global Gaming report, 90% of Hongkongers play video games at least once a week. \u2013 South China Morning Post\n ",

        "content": "The FBI on Thursday raided a Detroit-area medical facility for reportedly treating non-hospitalized coronavirus patients with intravenous vitamin C, which the FBI appears to be claiming is a \u201cfraudulent treatment.\u201d\n\nAllure Medical Spa, which is owned by Dr. Charles Mok, had been giving out vitamin C injections for free to first responders before the FBI came in and aggressively shut him down. FBI agents went into the building wearing full protective gear to protect themselves from potential exposure. Sources claim the raid is because Allure has been allegedly performing treatments for COVID-19 patients without an approved treatment or cure.\n\nOn April 18, Allure\u2019s Facebook page had a post that said \u201cAt Allure Medical, we have been using intravenous vitamin c therapy to treat COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients with great results.\u201d\n\nThat post, as well as a post on Allure Medical\u2019s official website on vitamin c treatments, has been taken down. After talking to staff members off-camera, some believe this is a misunderstanding. They claim the vitamin c is meant to help prevent or shorten the duration.\n\nDr. Charles Mok, who owns Allure Medical Spa, did a Facebook live video giving an IV-vitamin c treatment for free to a Detroit police officer. In the video, Mok said \u201cWhat I\u2019m finding in practice \u2014 I treat a lot of COVID patients \u2014 is that if we catch people early, get them on intravenous vitamin c, they turn around really fast.\u201d\n\nWhile it may not be a \u201ccure,\u201d vitamin C is being used widely as a treatment for coronavirus in hospitals throughout the world and has been shown to be effective in patients with sepsis and severe acute respiratory failure in past studies. Multiple clinical trials to study its effectiveness at treating the coronavirus are currently ongoing.\n\nFOX 2 Detroit, which simply parroted the line fed to them by the FBI, claimed vitamin C is a \u201cfake treatment\u201d and quoted FBI spokesperson Mara Schneider saying the clinic was accused of providing \u201cfraudulent treatments for COVID-19\u201d and allegedly \u201cdid not observe proper protocols to protect patients and staff from the virus.\u201d FOX 2 Detroit said a doctor at the facility told them Dr. Mok is \u201cahead of the curve in this type of treatment and has always put the [patients\u2019] health first, often treating them for free.\u201d\n\n\u201cVitamin C infusion, is a common practice in the US because it boosts the immune system,\u201d the doctor said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone there for several years and always found them to be so welcoming and helpful and informative,\u201d one of their patients told FOX 2 Detroit.\n\n\u201cThe FBI said that no one is in custody, no arrests were made but they did say that this was an ongoing investigation,\u201d FOX 2 Detroit reported.\n\nHere\u2019s what appears to be a press release Allure Medical put out the day of the raid:\n\nAllure Medical Offering High-Dose Intravenous Vitamin C to Frontline Employees\n\nAllure Medical is providing high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy to all frontline employees who are at risk of contracting COVID-19 and to existing COVID-19 patients. \u201cWe are using high-dose IV vitamin C to help support peoples\u2019 immune systems and to help those with the virus recover quicker. We want to provide this treatment to those who need it, regardless of their ability to pay,\u201d says Dr. Charles Mok, founder of Allure Medical.\n\nIntravenous vitamin C is being used in hospitals across the country to help the disease associated with COVID-19 \u2013 Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS \u2013 COV 2). In numerous studies intravenous vitamin C appears to reduce the duration and severity in more moderate forms of COVID-19 by stimulating your immune system. High-dose intravenous vitamin C is becoming the standard of care for patients.\n\nIf you are a frontline worker exposed to the COVID-19 or are currently showing any symptoms, you may want to boost your immune system with high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy. Most insurers have waived the co-pay deductibles for COVID-19-related diagnosis. Allure Medical is providing at risk, frontline workers, at no charge. Frontline workers, such as hospital staff, policemen, first responders, grocery store employees and others working closely with the public, are at a higher risk for contracting COVID-19. In addition, the general public can contact Allure Medical to conduct a telehealth evaluation to determine if immune support with a high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy would be beneficial. Please note: Allure Medical will not treat sick people at the same time as healthy people and continues to exceed CDC guidelines for disinfectants and cleanliness.\n\nThe only statement I can imagine the FBI could have taken issue with is Mok saying they\u2019re using it to \u201chelp those with the virus recover quicker.\u201d\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been proven yet in double-blind clinical trials that vitamin C helps coronavirus patients recover quicker but this is a doctor recommending a common treatment of a heavily studied, essential vitamin to non-hospitalized patients for (mostly) free.\n\nRaiding his facility and shutting his business down for giving free vitamin C treatments in the midst of a pandemic strikes me as massive overkill.\n\nCould this dispute not have been solved with a simple letter or a phone call?",

I\u2019m totally in favor of that, if done in the proper way, in the appropriate setting.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn general, I think most of the country is doing it in a prudent way. There are obviously some situations where people might be jumping over that. I just say please proceed with caution if you\u2019re going to do that,\u201d Fauci added.\n\nFauci\u2019s sudden change of heart regarding the lock downs caught the attention of Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, who criticized Fauci during \u201cTucker Carlson\u201d tonight.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to pile on Fauci, but we are making very important decisions based on what he\u2019s saying,\u201d Portnoy told host Tucker Carlson on Friday, \u201cand I think it\u2019s OK to say \u2018I really don\u2019t know, guys.'\u201d \u201cBut I get the feeling if you asked him this question, or \u2018What does one plus one equal?\u2019 you\u2019re going to get seven different answers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think at this point, you let people \u2014 individuals \u2014 make decisions for themselves,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only thing, as I said before, that we absolutely know for certain is if you continue the quarantine, tons of people are going to lose their livelihoods.\u201d Fauci, Big Pharma and the Mainstream Media would have you believe that vaccine injuries are RARE, but when the reports start piling up of all the damage caused by the exact vaccines Fauci has touted, it\u2019s important to start asking how rare they actually are\u2026",

        "content": "Delhi High Court has capped the maximum sale price of the COVID-19 test kits imported by Matrix Labs at Rs 400 per kit/test inclusive of GST.\nThe order was passed by a Single Judge Bench of Justice Najmi Waziri in the petition by Rare Metabolics Life Sciences (Petitioner) who had signed an agreement with the Respondent for being the exclusive distributor of medical products imported into India.\nOn March 25, the Petitioner expressed a desire to import one million/10 lakh WONDFO SARS CoV-2 Antibody tests and requested the Respondent to send it a Proforma Invoice etc at the earliest.\nThe Respondent acknowledged the order and replied that it would process the same soon.\nLater that month, the ICMR/National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research placed an order on the Petitioner's distributor for five lakh COVID-19 Rapid Tests at the rate of Rs 600 per test. The total value of the order was Rs 30 crores.\nThe Respondent, being the importer, obtained a licence to import medical material.\nOf the said order for five lakh, the Court was informed that 2.76 lakh had already been delivered to ICMR and the remaining 2.24 lakh tests were expected to be delivered very shortly after the consignment lands in India.\nThe Petitioner contended that Rs 12.75 crores had already been paid to the Respondent and this amount covered the cost of import of 5 lakh tests at the rate of USD 3 per test and the freight cost.\nAccording to the Respondent, the freight cost was in the range of approximately Rs 2 crores for one million tests, and thus the total cost for the ICMR destined kits/tests was Rs 12,25,00,000.\nThe Court was informed that the same were to be supplied to the Petitioner's distributor at an apparent profit of Rs 7.75 crores, for Rs 21 crores including GST.\nFurther, the Court noted that for the kits, the ICMR had to shell out an amount of Rs 30 crores plus GST, despite there being no value addition to the imported medical material.\nLooking at the situation, the Court observed,\n\" So, from the Rs.30 crores to be paid by ICMR for the 5 lakh kits/tests, Rs.18.75 lacs will be the shared by the intermediaries because, as discussed hereinabove, the actual costs of the monies paid to supplier/exporter was only Rs.11,25,00,000/- .\"\nThe first consignment of 2.76 lakh tests was delivered to ICMR on April 17, 2020, for which invoice had been raised but the payment was awaited as monies were to be paid after the tests met the requisite standards of the ICMR.\nIt was the Petitioner\u2019s case that the moment payment was received, it would be immediately remitted to the Respondent and thus sought the release of the remaining 7.24 lakh COVID-19 Rapid Test Kits by the Respondent.\nThe Respondent, on the other hand, contended that the import was on the understanding between the parties that there would be 100% upfront payment specifically apropos the consignment for ICMR.\nConsidering the fact that the kits/tests were required in the country on an urgent basis, the Court ordered that the remaining 2.24 lakh tests shall be delivered to ICMR, the moment it landed into India. It added that balance payment to the Respondent shall be paid by the Petitioner as soon as it is received from ICMR.\nThe Respondent also submitted that it had an order for supply of 50,000 kits/tests to the Government of Tamil Nadu, through an intermediary dealer viz. M/s Shan Biotech and Diagnostics, at the ICMR approved rate of @Rs.600 per test.\nOf this order, 24,000 has been supplied and 26,000 more are to be supplied, it was added.\nThe Court thus took the opportunity to review the cost and sale price of the test kits and opined that the profit mark-up 61% on the landed cost price was on a much higher side. The country is going through an unprecedented medical crisis affecting public order. People have been cloistered in their homes or constrained to stay wherever they were on 24th March 2020. The economy is virtually at a standstill for the last one month. There is an element of disquiet apropos one\u2019s safety. For people to be assured that the pandemic is under control and for governments to ensure and for agencies engaged in the frontline battle to safeguard people\u2019s health, more kits/tests should be made available urgently at the lowest cost, for carrying out extensive tests throughout the country. Public interest must outweigh private gain. The lis between the parties should give way to the larger public good. Delhi High Court\nFor the remaining kits, the Court thus ordered,\n\" In view of the above, the kits/test should be sold at a price not beyond Rs. 400/- per kit/test inclusive of GST. \"\nThe counsel to the Respondent also undertook to supply the kits/tests at Rs 400 each plus GST i.e. at 40% lesser than the ICMR approved rate, directly to any Government or its agency or private entity duly approved to carry out these tests.\nThe petition was disposed of in terms of the above directions.\nPetitioner was represented by Advocates Jayant Mehta, Anshumaan Sahni .\nRespondent was represented by Amitabh Chaturvedi, Jeevesh Nagrath, Sangeeth Mohan, Chandan Dutta.\n",

The concern is that it could spread to countries with weaker health systems. The UN agency said the new coronavirus has been exported to more than a dozen countries, now including India and the Philippines which have the latest cases. The agency defines an international emergency as an \u201cextraordinary event\u201d that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response, according to the Associated Press. The coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China in late December. To date, China has reported more than 7,800 cases including 170 deaths. Eighteen other countries have since reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is. There is now evidence that the virus is spreading among people in China and health experts have noted with concern instances in other countries \u2014 including the United States, France, Japan, Germany, Canada, and Vietnam \u2014 where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human transmission. \u201cThis declaration is not a vote of non-confidence in China...on the contrary, WHO continues to have the confidence in China\u2019s capacity to control the outbreak,\u201d the WHO chief said. With WHO declaring a global health emergency comes certain requirements and typically the declaration also brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. The announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries. Several countries, including the United States, Japan and some in the European Union, are evacuating their citizens from Wuhan. The United Kingdom was given the green light to fly nationals home in the early hours of Friday morning after a long delay. A number of other countries, including Russia and Mongolia, have closed their borders while many airlines are suspending flights to and from China. This is a developing story.",

The firm adjusted the production and operation in a timely manner, and also it implemented the measures as per the requirements and initiatives put in place by governments and responsible authorities at all levels.\nAfter learning about the initiatives of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese calling for donations from members of Chinese communities worldwide, Infinitus donated 5 million yuan (approx. USD720,000 ) to the Overseas Chinese Charity Foundation of China through the Si Li Ji Ren Foundation as a special fund to combat 2019-nCoV. The donation was sent directly to the affected areas in and around Wuhan.\nAt the same time, in response to the urgent demand for various kinds of protective supplies at Nanfang Hospital Affiliated to Southern Medical University, Infinitus immediately communicated with the hospital and donated one million yuan (approx. USD144,000 ) in supplies, including hand sanitizers and air purifiers, to help prevent and control the epidemic in Guangdong province.\nInfinitus will continue to pay attention to the development of the epidemic and provide more assistance in combatting it.",

        "content": "The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit (WECHU) is providing an update to local clinicians regarding the ongoing 2019-nCoV outbreak. Yesterday afternoon, declared a global public health emergency over the 2019-nCoV which does raise concerns, but nothing has changed as far as local preparedness. To date there are no cases in Windsor and Essex County . In response to the significant amount of communication and misinformation that is circulating within the community, the WECHU has developed a dedicated landing page on our website, www.wechu.org/coronavirus , which contains credible, reliable, and up-to-date local information for residents and health care providers in Windsor and Essex County (WEC). Please refer to the \u201cFor Professionals\u201d section of this page for important information including a link to the \u201cNovel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) Guidance for Primary Care Providers in a Community Setting\u201d recently developed by the Ministry of Health.\nThe risk of exposure to WEC residents, as well as all Canadians, remains low at this time. In the absence of a in our community, it\u2019s important to remind patients that they are more likely to contract locally circulating respiratory bacteria or viruses other than 2019-nCoV. Since the outbreak began in December, a number of patients tested (not in WEC) have come back positive for influenza and not 2019-nCoV. The precautions used to protect against 2019-nCoV are the same as those used to protect against common respiratory illnesses, such as influenza. The flu vaccine remains available in our community and remains the best protection against influenza. There is currently no vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV.\nBased on the latest research, this is what we now know about the 2019-nCoV. The virus is capable of person-to-person transmission. Most people are recovering from the infection and those died are elderly people with other comorbidities. A single case of 2019-nCoV can generate between 2.0-3.5 cases, this is slightly less than the number of cases that the influenza virus will generate. The average incubation period for 2019-nCoV seems to be approximately 5 days but it could be as long as 11 days. The case definition is still using 14 days as the incubation period.\nThere is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity and other features associated with 2019-nCoV and investigations are ongoing.\nAt this time, the WECHU is not recommending any additional precautions other than usual practices in response to any respiratory illness, which includes: Washing hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoiding close contact with people who are ill. Staying home when ill. Covering a cough or sneeze with tissue. Cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces that are frequently touched.\nHealth care providers play an important role in supporting the response to suspected cases of 2019-nCoV. It is recommended that clinicians should assess patients prior to notifying public health or referring them to an acute care center for testing. If a patient presents with respiratory symptoms, the patient should be provided a surgical mask, isolated and assessed to see if they meet the case definition for the 2019-nCoV. The case definition at this time is as follows: Anyone with respiratory symptoms and a 14 day travel history to Wuhan, China, or Hubei province in China , OR Anyone with respiratory symptoms who has been in close contact with someone who travelled to Wuhan/Hubei province.\nFor and other clinical resources, please visit our website www.wechu.org/coronavirus .\nThe new coronavirus is considered a disease of public health significance and all suspected or confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV must be reported to the WECHU. If a client meets the above case definition, please contact the WECHU at 519-258-2146, ext. 1420 for guidance and support as testing submission. For after-hours support (outside of 8:30am -4:30pm) please contact 519-973-4510.\nWhile the risks posed by this new coronavirus to WEC residents remain low, the WECHU worldwide and, in collaboration with all of our health care partners, is working to be fully prepared to respond as needed.",

Over the last week, the official number of coronavirus 2019-nCoV cases has doubled every day , and yesterday the WHO declared this a Global Health Emergency . While most cases (10,000+) are confined to China, the early death rate stands at 2-4 percent and as of today, 27 nations are reporting infections.\nWhat danger does coronavirus actually pose to you ? Perspective is important. Consider another viral infection with many similarities: influenza. Since October 2019, some 15 million Americans have become infected and greater than 8,500 have perished. At the moment, the risk of dying from a lightning strike (1 in 161,856) is greater than dying from coronavirus. However, this new infection has serious potential to become a worldwide calamity, parallel to the Spanish Influenza Epidemic of 1918.\nHow can you protect yourself from coronavirus infection? This is a disease spread via respiratory droplets. So, everything we know about the common cold also applies to prevention of coronavirus, especially hand washing, avoiding contact with ill person, staying home if ill, and reporting to a healthcare facility if no improvement. Let us not take such simple measure to mean today\u2019s Global Health Emergency is unwarranted. In our international airline world, a pandemic could emerge within just days.",

We have always been prudent with our capital and remain committed to managing investments with a close eye on balancing revenue and expenses. As a result, we are currently reviewing all aspects of our operations and cost structure with a focus on positioning the company to emerge strong when economic conditions improve, while maintaining the high levels of support and satisfaction that our customers expect.\u201d\n\u201cWhile the current environment is challenging, Tufin\u2019s products are critical to helping customers improve network security and do more with less through automation, both of which are vitally important today,\u201d said Kitov. \u201cOur competitive advantages, along with our strong balance sheet and experienced management team, position us well to manage through this crisis and I remain optimistic about the substantial long-term opportunity ahead of us. I\u2019m proud of all Tufin employees for pulling together to help our customers in an unprecedentedly difficult operating environment and I\u2019m thankful for everyone\u2019s hard work.\u201d\nThe company plans to report its full financial results for the first quarter 2020 prior to the market open on May 12, 2020. In conjunction with this report, the company will host a conference call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on May 12, 2020 to discuss the company\u2019s results and its business outlook. To participate in the call, please dial (866) 211-3126 in the U.S. or (647) 689-6579 for international participants and enter Conference ID# 7394077. The call will also be webcast live on Tufin\u2019s Investor Relations website at investors.tufin.com.

Enterprises select the company\u2019s Tufin Orchestration Suite\u2122 to increase agility in the face of ever-changing business demands while maintaining a robust security posture. The Suite reduces the attack surface and meets the need for greater visibility into secure and reliable application connectivity. With over 2,000 customers since its inception, Tufin\u2019s network security automation enables enterprises to implement changes in minutes instead of days, while improving their security posture and business agility.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nBecause of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company\u2019s non-cash expense as well as certain non-recurring costs that are not representative or indicative of our ongoing operations, the Company believes that providing non-GAAP operating profit (loss) allows for more meaningful comparisons of its operating results from period to period. This non-GAAP financial measure is an important tool for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating the Company\u2019s operating results over different periods.\nTufin defines non-GAAP operating profit (loss) as operating profit (loss) excluding share-based compensation expense and one-time expenses associated with reorganization in of one of our subsidiaries.\nOther companies, including companies in Tufin\u2019s industry, may calculate non-GAAP operating profit (loss) differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of this non-GAAP financial measure for comparison. You should consider this non-GAAP financial measure along with other financial performance measures, including operating profit (loss), and Tufin\u2019s financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Tufin urges investors to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measure to the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business.\nTufin has not provided a reconciliation of this estimated non-GAAP financial measure to its comparable GAAP financial measure because it could not produce the corresponding GAAP financial measure by the date of this press release without unreasonable effort. Tufin believes the information provided is useful to investors for evaluating its operating results over different periods and can be considered together with its historical disclosures of this measure. GAAP results and a detailed reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure will be presented in connection with Tufin\u2019s press release reporting full financial results for the first quarter 2020 scheduled to be released prior to the market open on May 12, 2020.\nCautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains forward-looking statements, which express the current beliefs and expectations of Tufin\u2019s (the \u201cCompany\u201d) management.

He believes infections have already peaked, for example, in Fairfield County but may not reach the peak in eastern Connecticut until May 3 or 4.\nHitting the peak, however, does not mean a quick drop in hospitalizations or people needing to protect themselves from COVID-19 infection, Dr. Kumar said. Rather, he said, he anticipates the descent will be drawn out.\n\u201cThis is a long process.,\u201d he said. \u201c(It won\u2019t be) a sudden drop, more like a plateauing and it will all depend on how we continue social distancing, testing and tracking. For the first week or two after the peak, it will be a plateau with very small decreases (in infection) across the state. \u201cAnd, there is the risk for it coming back.\u201d\nThe other positive news Dr. Kumar offered was the fact that there have been 11 people who recovered from COVID-19 and donated what\u2019s called convalescent plasma to help those who are still in critical condition with the disease. Some of the plasma recipients, he reported, have been improving and several have been taken off their ventilators. He did caution that, without more data, the effect of the plasma transfusions is still largely uncertain.\n\u201cWe need more data and to be more scientific,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the early indications seem to be positive.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Corona move Coronaviral infection exerts a significant impact on cargo traffic, ports and shipping. The problem has touched the container flow from China and LNG transportation. Not only do stevedoring and shipping companies face difficulties, it is also a tough time for forwarders who run the risk of \u201cholding the bag\u201d due to delayed deliveries.\nThe virus hits the box\nThe outbreak of coronavirus has lead to service interruption at the country\u2019s ports which are to a great extent the core of the international trade.\nAs for the impact on Russia's port industry, the situation in China can cause the reduction of container throughput in domestic ports.\nIn his interview with IAA PortNews  , Aleksey Shukletsov, Executive Director of OOO Fenix (operator of Multipurpose Sea Cargo Complex Bronka in Saint-Petersburg), said that the situation with the virus can have a negative impact on the container market of Saint-Petersburg in the nearest months.\n\u201cCoronavirus causes the market turbulence which can entail the fall of container flow on the Chinese lines in the coming month or two. Then everything will depend on how fast China succeeds with the problem localization and production recovery\u201d, said Aleksey Shukletsov.\nFor example, Nissan management says it may temporarily halt assembling cars at its plant in St. Petersburg due to coronavirus-related shortages of Chinese-made components.\nAccording to Baltic Sea Ports Administration, container turnover in Saint-Petersburg has not been affected yet: in January it grew by 5%, year-on-year, to 186,200 TEUs.\nDelayed deliveries may create problems for logistics service providers, forwarders and other companies responsible for timely supply of cargo. TT Club says restrictions due to labour shortages at ports and cancellations of inland transport links within China, constraints in the supply of goods due to factory closures and reduced schedules of air, ocean and rail carriers may expose forwarders to claims arising from delivery delays and cargo deterioration. According to TT Club, forwarders should identify any \"force majeure\" clauses in their agreements and preemptively send notices to customers setting out the problems in China and invoking their force majeure right to be discharged from their obligations to perform.\nThe international rating agency Fitch Ratings said coronavirus outbreak in China could put the global natural gas market under stress. According to open sources, some Chinese importers of LNG have declared 'force majeure' on their contracts, which may cancel up to 70% of seaborne imports in February.\n\u201cClean hands\u201d operation\nCoronavirus causes a special problem for ferry and cruise ship operators: Thailand denied entry to the Westerdam luxury liner amid coronavirus fears despite no passengers testing positive for the coronavirus; South Korea has imposed a temporary entry ban on international cruise ships that have recently visited countries with confirmed cases of the infection, while all direct ferry services connecting Taiwan with the Chinese provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang are temporarily suspended from February 10.\nThe most telling story is that of the cruise ship Diamond Princess which has actually turned into a quarantine prison for 3,700 tourists off the port city of Yokohama in Japan. Mildly speaking, that does not make cruises attractive in the midst of coronavirus hysteria. The risk of being confined together with the infected people on board a ship with a general system of ventilation and catering is very high.\nCruise operators worldwide are undertaking additional protection measures.\nTallink, Baltic Sea ferry operator, told IAA PortNews it had toughened hygienic requirements several weeks ago with a focus on cleaning, disinfection and monitoring of possible symptoms among the passengers and crewmembers.\n\u201cThe governments of the Scandinavian and Baltic states have not yet issued their lists of requirements necessary actions but we are ready to follow any instructions of the authorities\u201d, says Tallink.\nAccording to the company, \u201cthe number of passengers from Asia decreases in the beginning of the year and the first quarter is not a high season. Therefore, we see a normal reduction of Chinese passengers\u2019 flow. The bulk of Chinese groups fell on January 26-27 will all group trips booked for February and March have been postponed for later periods and ferries do not carry any groups from China. Since some countries have suspended issue of visas to Chinese citizens and Finnair has cancelled flights to China, the number of individual tourists will reduce as well. Despite the abovementioned factors, coronavirus will not affect the general financial results of the company as the share of cancelled trips makes 0.1% of the total passenger traffic\u201d.\nFrom our part, we emphasize that the fact of infection on cruise ships is not new: outbreaks of various infective diseases on liners are regular worldwide. They are often caused by norovirus. What matters is the lethality rate and availability of a vaccine. In this context, not everything is clear in the case of coronavirus.",

        "content": "Wuhan coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV is a new type of a virus, extremely dangerous and with an ability to spread fast. Virus from China There are almost 40 coronaviruses we are familiar with nCoV means Novel Coronavirus which means that it is new and its behavior is not yet totally understood. What we know is that it is a coronavirus. There are almost 40 coronaviruses we are familiar with and they all share similar characteristics. This is a family of viruses we can find in animals, from cattle to domestic animals like cats, and wild species like bats. Now, they usually stay among animal population but when the jump occurs, consequences are deadly. And that's exactly what happened to 2019-nCoV: an animal to person spread happened, and when the Wuhan coronavirus found its home in humans, a mutation occurred. The virus started to spread between people via air, which is scary by itself, but then it became worse: people without symptoms may spread the virus and that's an ideal situation for any virus. A silent spread is what every virus dreams of. Add to that 14 days period of incubation during which an infected person comes into a contact with other people and you have a very fast spread of a very nasty virus. Common human coronaviruses, that's something we all catch sooner or later, and several times in our lives. A common cold is a typical example of our close encounter with that type of viruses. Usually, they cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses. Symptoms are exactly what you could thought they are: cough, cough, runny nose, headache, fever. Human coronaviruses can spread lower to a lower-respiratory tract and cause well known bronchitis and pneumonia. So, what's so scared about Wuhan coronavirus? First, it's new. We know that it is more than 85 percent identical with a SARS virus but it's just similar, it in fact belongs to another lineage of the sarbecovirus subgenus of the Coronaviridae family. That means two problems. First, since it's new, we don't know exactly how to fight against it. Second, it's similarity to SARS is not good: SARS causes very serious symptoms and fatality rate is high. Patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection reported mild to severe symptoms: fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Those symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Then comes the pneumonia which is severe and can lead to death. Second, another bad news is that although we know that 2019-nCoV spreads person to person but we don't know exactly how, the underlining mechanism is still not clearly known. That's the reason Wuhan coronavirus spreads so easily and fast, much faster than other known viruses. So, what to do? There is currently no vaccine against 2019-nCoV. The best way, as with other viruses, is to avoid being exposed to the virus. The best way is to wear a mask if you are in an infected region. Well, there are some problems here too. The first type of masks is a surgical masks you can buy anywhere. But, they don't prevent a person from inhaling smaller airborne particles and they are not officially recognized as a protection. And they are not airtight. Another type, N95 respirators, is something healthcare professionals use. They are tight fitting and filter out at least 95% of airborne particles. You can buy them too but you must be trained to fit them correctly. Thus, masks won't give you a 100% protection, they will just stop some number of particles to get in your system. In other words, better something than nothing. If you are in a contaminated area, or think you are, you should: - Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds - Avoid touching your head with unwashed hands - Avoid close contact with people who are sick - Stay home if you are sick - Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue - Clean frequently touched surfaces with disinfect If you think you were exposed to 2019-nCoV you should contact your doctor right away. Since there is no specific treatment for Wuhan coronavirus infection patients receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. In severe cases, treatment includes care to support vital organ functions. ",

        "content": "The number of those who have died from the Wuhan coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, in China climbed to 361 and cases have been reported in other countries including the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and several others.\nMusician Zhang Yaru\u2019s grandmother died on Monday after slipping into a coma. She was repeatedly turned away from the hospital.\nJohn Chen, a college graduate, is desperately seeking help for his mom. She has a high fever, but isn\u2019t strong enough to stand in line for hours to be tested for the virus raging through their city.\nOn the front line, a 30-year-old respiratory doctor has slept only a few hours in two weeks.\nScenes of chaos and despair are emerging daily from China\u2019s Hubei province, the landlocked region of 60 million people where the new coronavirus dubbed 2019-nCoV was first identified in December, and where it has since cut a wide, deadly swathe.\nWhile cases have spread around the globe, the virus\u2019 impact has been most keenly felt in Hubei, which has seen a staggering 97 percent of all deaths from the illness, and 67 percent of all patients.\nThe toll, which grows larger every day, reflects a local health system overwhelmed by the fast-moving, alien pathogen, making even the most basic care impossible. It\u2019s also an ongoing illustration of the human cost extracted by the world\u2019s largest-known quarantine, with China effectively locking down the region from January 23, 2020, to contain the virus\u2019 spread to the rest of the country, and the world.\nBut Hubei\u2014known for its car factories and bustling capital Wuhan\u2014is paying the price, with the mortality rate for coronavirus patients there 3.1percent, versus 0.16 percent for the rest of China.\n\u201cIf the province was not sealed off, some people would have gone all around the country to try to get medical help, and would have turned the whole nation into an epidemic-stricken area,\u201d said Yang Gonghuan, former deputy director general of China\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cThe quarantine brought a lot of hardship to Hubei and Wuhan, but it was the right thing to do.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s like fighting a war\u2014some things are hard, but must be done.\u201d\nWuhan, home to 11 million people, is a \u201csecond-tier\u201d Chinese city, meaning it\u2019s relatively developed but still a step below China\u2019s major metropolises of Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. It has well-regarded hospitals, but resources lag behind those of more prominent cities.\nIn the early days of the virus\u2019 spread, prevarication and delay by local officials also allowed the pathogen to circulate more widely among an unsuspecting public.\nWhile doctors first noticed the virus\u2014thought to have been passed from an animal to humans at a Wuhan food market\u2014in early December, and signs it was being transmitted among people were seen at the beginning of January, authorities still allowed large-scale public events to take place. The scale of the crisis only became fully apparent to the wider public in the days leading up to the start of China\u2019s annual Lunar New Year holiday on January 24, 2020, as cases emerged elsewhere. Caught out\nIt came \u201clike a sudden downpour that caught Wuhan off guard,\u201d said Zeng Yan, a professor at the school of medicine at Wuhan University of Science and Technology.\nThe 110 intensive care unit beds in the city designated for virus patients had already been filled many times over when China announced on January 23, 2020, that it would take the unprecedented step of sealing off Wuhan, preventing possible pathogen carriers from traveling out, but also preventing most people from coming in. The quarantine soon widened to encompass nearly the entire province.\nIn the chaotic, confused days that followed, which coincided with China\u2019s weeklong national holiday, the quarantine restrictions coupled with an already overwhelmed city infrastructure meant that supplies of essential medical equipment including masks, protective suits and high-grade disinfectant were slow to get to Wuhan\u2019s hospitals.\n\u201cWe were advised to use masks, gloves and protective clothing in a thrifty manner, and avoid drinking water so we would not have to go to the bathroom, which would require a change of protective clothing,\u201d said one frontline doctor working at the Third People\u2019s Hospital of Hubei province, who declined to give her name for fear of reprisal. Supplies stymied\nDing Ze, whose family owns an eyewear company located in another part of China, said that their delivery of medical goggles to Wuhan was delayed by 10 days.\n\u201cWe sent the supply on January 25 and they arrived at hospitals on February 2,\u201d he said. \u201cAll deliveries from outside to the province were slowed by the strict quarantine procedures.\u201d\nWhile China\u2019s government activated eight cargo carriers on February 2, 2020, to ship in 58 tons of supplies to Wuhan, and donations are starting to flow in from all over the world, the shortages in those crucial days\u2014combined with the virus\u2019 rapid spread as the surge in patients saw hospitals turn people away for lack of space\u2014had devastating consequences.\nBetween January 23 and February 4, 2020, the number of officially recorded deaths from the coronavirus in Hubei grew by over 25 times, to nearly 500. Scores more likely went unrecorded because they weren\u2019t admitted to hospital in time to be diagnosed.\nZhang Yaru\u2019s grandmother was turned away from hospital at the end of January because her symptoms were mild. She slipped into a coma shortly after and died without being diagnosed.\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t manage to say a word to us before she died, she probably had no idea what happened,\u201d said Zhang, a native of E\u2019Zhou, a smaller city adjacent to Wuhan that\u2019s also being quarantined. \u201cOur family is now driven into a corner, desperate, all my family members are potentially infected and my grandfather is showing the same symptoms.\u201d\nWhile virus cases within Hubei province are still growing by the thousands every day, infections are slowing in the rest of China\u2014an early sign that the aggressive containment may have worked to limit the coronavirus\u2019 spread nationally and globally.\nThe quarantine was the right thing to do for the good of the wider population, said the doctor at the Third People\u2019s Hospital. \u201cSome may say Hubei was sacrificed, but it did effectively stem the spread to elsewhere.\u201d\nThe quarantine in Hubei dwarfs previous efforts in other parts of the world. In Liberia in 2014, an impoverished neighborhood of about 70,000 people was shut off during an Ebola outbreak, triggering violent riots. As the lockdown continues with no end in sight, it\u2019s raising ethical and legal questions.\n\u201cThe lockdown may be necessary to contain the spread of the virus, but you have to ensure there\u2019s enough medical resources to meet the demand for care in those cities,\u201d said Zhang Qianfan, a professor at Peking University Law School. \u201cThe lockdown shouldn\u2019t mean the city gets deserted and people are left to survive or die on their own.\u201d Top priority\nReports of potentially preventable deaths in Hubei exacerbated by the quarantine restrictions have been coursing through China, said Yanzhong Huang, director of the Center for Global Health Studies at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, and a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.\nComparing the \u201cdraconian measures\u201d in Hubei to the mass surveillance prevalent in China that would seem intolerable to many in the west, he said: \u201cIf you ask Chinese people, 8 out of 9 will say they can live with that.\u201d\nIn the days after the quarantine order, China\u2019s government sent medical assistance into the province, while maintaining restrictions on people leaving.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m playing a game. It\u2019s like \u2018Resident Evil.\u2019 Today and every day I need to do a mission.\u201d\nMore than 8,000 medical workers from across the country have gone into Hubei, mostly to the 27 hospitals in Wuhan designated for treating coronavirus patients. The rest have fanned out to smaller cities nearby. Two new hospitals, with 2,600 beds in total, were completed in 10 days, built by more than 2,000 migrant workers, while stadiums, offices and hotels are being converted into isolation units.\nBut hospitals in Hubei are still short of supplies, said a doctor working in the testing department at the Wuhan Tongji hospital. He also declined to give his name on concern he\u2019d face backlash.\n\u201cThings are improving, but we are really overloaded and running diagnostic tests 24-7, and still struggle to complete them,\u201d the doctor said on Tuesday. \u201cI think we have not reached the peak of infections yet.\u201d No blame\nFor those seeking help and medical care in Hubei, resignation has set in\u2014there has been markedly little unrest in the province despite the circumstances. The idea of sacrificing one\u2019s self for a greater, national goal is deeply embedded in Chinese culture, and is invoked by the country\u2019s leaders in times of hardship.\nPeople are queuing for eight hours just to get tested for the coronavirus, said the college graduate, John Chen, who\u2019s 23. His feverish mother is yet to be tested.\n\u201cAt first I was upset that the hospitals and officials I called for help weren\u2019t willing to do their job, but later I realized that it\u2019s not that they are unwilling to help, but that everywhere is way too short of resources,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame anyone, because if you grow up in China, you learn that\u2019s how the system works.\u201d",

        "content": "As more than 500 people have been infected by a viral pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus (named by WHO as 2019-nCoV), and at least 17 people have died, WHO has issued travel advice and prevention advice for the public. Source: WHO\nThe good news is that the World Health Organisation (WHO) convened an Emergency Committee which advised that the event does not constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern\u2026 but they did agree on the urgency of the situation, and will reconvene in a few days\u2019 time to reassess the situation. What is Coronavirus 2019-nCoV?\nIt\u2019s a new virus which comes from the same family as SARS and the common cold, say WHO. Because this is a coronavirus, it usually causes respiratory illness. Where did this Coronavirus begin?\nIt was first reported in Wuhan City, China, on 31 December 2019, and has since been detected in travellers to other countries, including the USA. WHO is working with the Chinese authorities and global experts to learn more about the virus and how to prevent its spread. What are the symptoms of Coronavirus?\nSymptoms include fever and occasional difficulty in breathing. Chest radiographs have shown bilateral lung infiltrates. Can Coronavirus be passed on from human to human?\nPreliminary investigation suggests that there is no significant human-to-human transmission, and no infections among health care workers have occurred, says WHO.\nHowever transmission potential and modes of transmission remain unclear and more information is required to better understand the mode of transmission and clinical manifestation of this new virus. What is the source of this newly discovered Coronavirus?\nThe source of this new virus is not yet known, however virologists believe that snakes \u2013 the Chinese krait and the Chinese cobra \u2013 may be the original source of this coronavirus .\nFor now, the following advice has been issued in relation to the pneumonia outbreak caused by the new coronavirus in China: WHO Advice for the Public\nWHO\u2019s standard recommendations for the general public to reduce exposure to and transmission of a range of illnesses are as follows, which include hand and respiratory hygiene, and safe food practices: Frequently clean hands by using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water; When coughing and sneezing cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue \u2013 throw tissue away immediately and wash hands; Avoid close contact with anyone who has fever and cough; If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early and share previous travel history with your health care provider; When visiting live markets in areas currently experiencing cases of novel coronavirus, avoid direct unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals; The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, milk or animal organs should be handled with care, to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices. WHO Advice for International Travel and Trade International travellers: practice usual precautions\nAs transmission potential is still unclear, it would be prudent to reduce the general risk of acute respiratory infections while travelling in or from affected areas (currently Wuhan City) by: avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections; frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment; avoiding close contact with live or dead farm or wild animals; travellers with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).\nNo restrictions to international traffic have been recommended at this time.\nAll information sourced from WHO .

        "content": "Future Tense Violating People\u2019s Rights Is Not the Way to Address the Coronavirus Many of China\u2019s actions to date are overly aggressive and ineffective in quelling the emerging outbreak. By James G. Hodge Jr. and Leila Barraza Jan 24, 2020 11:05 AM A police officer checks the temperature of a driver at a highway in Wuhan, China, on Jan. 24, 2020. STR/Getty Images Since its emergence from Wuhan, China, on New Year\u2019s Eve 2019, novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV , is spreading rapidly, escalating domestic and international concerns, and leading to calls for emergency declarations. Advertisement By now one might think that we are globally prepared for these type of threats given the successful control of prior coronaviruses like SARS and MERS since 2002. Yet, as Catharine I. Paules, Hilary D. Marsto, and Anthony S. Fauci note in the Journal of the American Medical Association , \u201c[t]he emergence of yet another outbreak of human disease caused by a [coronavirus] \u2026 underscores the perpetual challenge of emerging infectious diseases and the importance of sustained preparedness.\u201d It is a contemporary challenge seemingly lost on the World Health Organization , Chinese government authorities, and other national leaders. On Thursday, after considering all available evidence, WHO\u2019s emergency committee voted against declaring a state of public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC . Invoking the emergency is more than political posturing. PHEIC\u2019s trigger implementation of the International Health Regulations modernized in 2007 specifically in response to lessons learned from SARS. WHO\u2019s committee reached this decision even though \u201cit is expected that further international exportation of cases may appear in any country.\u201d Subject to subsequent reconsideration, its conclusion seems ill-fated in the face of a rapidly spreading condition transmitted from human-to-human with no known cure, treatment, or vaccine, and a fatality rate that already approaches 4 percent. Perhaps seeking to avoid another global debacle from its mishandling and blatant misrepresentation of the spread of SARS in 2002, Chinese authorities have significantly ramped up their responses. Many of their actions to date, however, are overly aggressive, inviolate of human rights, and ineffective in quelling the emerging outbreak. Advertisement Chinese officials have created a \u201c cordon sanitaire \u201d around Wuhan and multiple other cities identified as hotbeds for 2019-nCoV incubation and spread. They basically have blocked 35+ million people from leaving their jurisdictional boundaries. With thousands of flights canceled, outsiders are prevented from entry as well. People stuck in Wuhan and elsewhere are further restricted in their movements about their communities. Those with signs of infection are inundating local hospitals where they are processed and screened. Hundreds of infected individuals have been forced into isolation. More than a dozen health care workers have become infected in attempting to treat index cases. Worse still, Chinese media and other sources are downplaying the public health threat. Recent Chinese broadcasts have avoided portraying 2019-nCoV as an extant risk to populations. Social media platforms are helping to expose government-sanctioned disinformation but also distributing falsified rumors about the virus and fears of retaliatory efforts for failing to report symptoms. Some Chinese officials have taken a harsh approach to assure public health compliance. A temporary social media post by a Communist Party committee stated that anyone deliberately hiding disease infection in China will be \u201c forever nailed to history\u2019s pillar of shame.\u201d Other countries are imposing travel restrictions against Chinese citizens. North Korea has already closed its borders to foreign tourists despite lucrative resources they bring to its struggling economy. With history as a guide, some countries will soon consider restricting flights into and out of China despite WHO guidance. Advertisement Emerging infectious diseases like 2019-nCoV understandably contribute to public apprehension, which is then exacerbated by these sorts of overly aggressive governmental responses. Ideally, public health measures should be predicated on specific epidemiologic findings and proven interventions tied directly to actual risks supported by solid epi data. Admittedly, it is tough to deploy public health measures when available data are sketchy or untrusted. Consequently, international health entities and national or regional governments sometimes 1) revert to \u201csafe\u201d decisions to avoid political controversy (for instance, WHO\u2019s decision not to declare a PHEIC) or 2) employ highly restrictive measures to limit public health repercussions (for instance, Chinese city quarantines/ travel restrictions ). The truth is that neither approach actually works. What does work are lawful, ethical, and human rights-based interventions that entail public health powers that are tailored to specific risks and encourage people to voluntarily comply where possible to accomplish legitimate, communal objectives. Take, for example, public health interventions to assure safe air travel. Global flights unquestionably present risks of spreading diseases. Multiple countries, including the U.S., already have documented 2019-nCoV cases arriving within their borders through air travel. More cases will assuredly surface. Yet shutting down air travel is not an option economically nor is it beneficial from a public health perspective. Most passengers and crew members present no risks of infection of 2019-nCoV. Advertisement Rather than restricting or prohibiting flights from China as some countries (including China) have done in prior outbreaks, U.S. public health authorities are wisely implementing noninvasive screening efforts for select flights to assess health risks among passengers or crew members. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initiated enhanced screening for 2019-nCoV initially at 3 U.S. airports (JFK, LAX, SFO) on Jan. 17. Two additional airports (ORD, ATL) were designated soon thereafter. Enhanced screening methods employ surveillance to track potential cases within airports receiving the vast majority of passengers from affected countries. Such passengers are initially questioned and participate in noninvasive temperature checks at exit and entry points. It is rare that more invasive measures like quarantine and isolation are needed following airport screening. Very few passengers are actually found to be infectious through these screening measures. When WHO declared a PHEIC on Aug. 8, 2014, concerning Ebola in West Africa, countries with active transmissions conducted exit screening at international airports. In Sierra Leone\u2019s Freetown International Airport, 166,242 passengers underwent Ebola exit screening between September 2014 and February 2016. Ten passengers were identified as potentially symptomatic; five were denied travel because they were infected with malaria and typhoid (two cases), but not Ebola. Entry screening techniques employed at several U.S. airports during the same outbreak rendered no confirmed cases over a 30-day span in 2014. While the efficacy of noninvasive, limited airport screenings for infectious diseases like Ebola and 2019-nCoV may be questioned, its legality and utility are not. WHO and the CDC view such screening as an essential component of global response efforts to raise global awareness, derail prospective ill-travelers, track and monitor potential cases, and instill confidence among all passengers in the continued safety of air travel. Advertisement So what\u2019s a key take-away from emerging approaches? Real-time responses are needed, but not if they infringe human rights without justification. As with prior outbreaks, the best approach to protect populations is matching accurate data with good science and respect for individual rights. ",

        "content": "Incidentally, China is not alone as the spread of the virus continues across over 25 countries, this staggering fact portends a bleak outlook for the global economy, and the sooner this outbreak is brought under control, the better for everyone. by Mike Adeyemi Lawal Feb 07, 2020\nWhen outbreaks occur, there is the possibility of activating a panic mode button in an attempt to immediately halt the spread or prevent further escalation of the situation. The panic response of Nigeria during the 2014 Ebola outbreak has become a success story in outbreak management, in spite of being described as \u201cusing a sledgehammer to kill an ant\u201d in terms of resource deployment during the outbreak. Still, the question here is: What has the Ebola outbreak response taught us?\nUnderstanding the situation\nIt is commendable that World Health Organization has declared the 2019 Novel Corona Virus (nCoV) as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC); this action has put nCoV on a broader global table for further discussions. A drawback of the 2014 Ebola response was the delay in response to the epidemic which was attributed to both political and technical factors, top among which was the limited understanding of how the disease was spreading in the community, especially among rural dwellers.\nThe rapid increase of nCoV cases from 282 on 20th January to above 9,000 by the 31st January 2019 makes the spread of nCoV scary. If this situation is not contained early enough, it might lead to a bigger worldwide outbreak at the peak of the epidemic. Also, following the shutdown of Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, it was not clear how many infected persons have left the city or those with mild infections not attended to in the limited number of hospitals in Wuhan where most cases were likely to present due to less developed primary health care in China.\nCommunity engagement\nDistrust is not uncommon during outbreaks. Outbreaks are always a period of conspiracy theories, wishful narratives and frivolous conclusions. The ugly situations in Liberia and Sierra Leone in the wake of Ebola outbreaks stemmed from family members' attempt to conceal their loved ones who were suspected cases and the subsequent militarization of the response by the Government of Sierra Leone. Were the people callous to allow their loved ones to die? No, but the reality was that they could not figure out what was happening in the no-entry isolation where people went in and came out as corpse. Was that the situation in the treatment isolation? No, but there was an obvious gap in communication between what the health practitioners were doing in the treatment isolation and what the people\u2019s understanding was.\nIf an outbreak strategy must work, the people should understand the nature of what is affecting them. This includes identifying community power brokers and developing a proper plan for engagement to ensure mutual understanding and collective efforts. It is a fact that the success of outbreak management is how much the smallest unit of the community understands the situation and any gap in communication will be filled by narratives that might jeopardize the outcome of the outbreak.\nFirst things first\nThe low mortality from nCoV and the doubling time of 7 days give ample opportunity to analyze its genomes and proffer more robust case management that is specific to the virus, including the development of a rapid diagnostic test, effective vaccine and antiviral drugs. However, the fear is putting a lot of efforts on these novel innovations and neglecting the basics in outbreak management for infectious diseases like nCoV, which is - Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC).\nBorrowing from my experience in outbreak response, before the development of the Oral cholera vaccines, the success of cholera outbreak response lies mainly on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) strategy and supportive case management with fluid therapy. Until such effective treatment or vaccines are available, the first things first \u2013 Infection, Prevention and Control.\nWhy the world must take nCoV seriously\nThe death rate from 2019-nCoV is about 2%, and this implies that nCoV is likely to be less virulent compared to Ebola virus, however, selective death among individuals with compromised immunity, young children and older people is a source of concern.\nMore burden on weak health systems. Despite no confirmed case reported in Africa, it is glaring and predictable that the fragile health systems in most of the countries in the region are inadequate to support a sustained response in case of an outbreak. Furthermore, if the outbreak persists for too long, reactive and disproportionate funding is expected to set in, leading to a reduction in the financing of other global health interventions at national and international levels. This will inadvertently lead to a regression in the achievement made so far in those interventions.\nIn the press release on the declaration of nCoV as a PHEIC, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of World Health Organization, stated that \u201cThe main reason for this declaration is not what is happening in China but what is happening in other countries.\u201d In light of this comes the dimension of a global economic perspective. It is on record that many airlines have suspended their China flight routes, and more countries are putting travel restrictions. The New York Times also reported the slowest pace of the Chinese economy in decades and investors are sceptical on how this will turn out. The Chinese economy plays a crucial role in the global economy being the second largest economy in the world, with about 15.5% of the global economy.\nIncidentally, China is not alone as the spread of the virus continues across over 25 countries, this staggering fact portends a bleak outlook for the global economy, and the sooner this outbreak is brought under control, the better for everyone.\nMike Adeyemi Lawal is a medical doctor with Medecins Sans Frontieres and Global Health Advocate",

( OTCQB: RXMD ) (\u201cProgressive Care\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a personalized healthcare services and technology company, in an effort to provide support and resources for those concerned about the risks associated with the emerging threat posed by the spread of Wuhan Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), is pleased to provide critical educational and informational support services at this important stage in the progression of the disease.\nWhat to Know: According to the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d), Coronaviruses (CoV) are \u201ca large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).\u201d\nOn December 31, 2019, the WHO became aware of new strain \u2013 a \u201cnovel coronavirus (nCoV)\u201d \u2013 not previously identified in humans that first appeared in the form of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. It appears as though this marks the emergence of a new infectious disease borne of a non-human-to-human virus in this region that mutated into a state allowing for human-to-human infectious transmission.\nThis disease has spread rapidly. Many questions still remain, including whether or not the disease is fully contagious in the pre-symptomatic incubation period. Chinese authorities and authorities in many countries are already taking rapid action to slow the spread of the disease, and biomedical facilities around the world are working hard to create a viable vaccine, with some early-stage candidate compositions already beginning animal testing.\nWorldwide there are now more than 6,000 cases and 132 deaths, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control . There have been no reported deaths outside of China and all deaths have been in patients who were elderly or otherwise unwell. In the U.S., the CDC is reporting five confirmed cases from these states: Washington, Illinois, California, and Arizona, all of whom had recently visited Wuhan. According to the CDC, there is no evidence that 2019-nCoV has spread from human to human in the US, nor is there evidence that imported Chinese goods are affected. The mortality rate for those infected by 2019-nCoV is not yet fully understood but appears to be relatively low in the scale of prior serious infectious disease epidemics, with many patients recovering over a period of days back to full health.\nWhat to Do: The WHO has a list of suggested guidelines for behavioral prevention of infection with Wuhan Coronavirus: Frequently clean hands by using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water; When coughing and sneezing, cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue \u2013 throw the tissue away immediately and wash hands; Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever and cough; If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early and share previous travel history with your health care provider; When visiting live markets in areas currently experiencing cases of novel coronavirus, avoid direct unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals; The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, milk or animal organs should be handled with care, to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices.\nAccording to WebMD, symptoms include fever, coughing, and shortness of breath. They may appear 2 to 14 days after you\u2019re exposed to the virus. The flu and its symptoms are common and it is recommended to be treated with Tamiflu\u00ae and more recently Relenza Diskhaler\u00ae. The Coronavirus is very similar to the flu and has most of the same symptoms aside from a history of travel exposure. Pamela Roberts, PharmD, Director of Pharmacy stated \u201cTreatment would be similar for both viruses. Symptomatic care would consist of lots of fluids, rest, and OTC pain relievers as needed.\u201d\n\u201cIt is important to stay calm and follow common flu/disease prevention protocols. Wash hands thoroughly, avoid direct contact with anyone showing flu-like symptoms, and seek early diagnosis and treatment when symptoms present themselves,\u201d said S. Parikh Mars, CEO.\nFor More Help: If you or someone you know has further questions or concerns about the risks posed by Wuhan Coronavirus, including how to prevent infection or how to respond to potential associated symptoms, please contact PharmCo, and a team member with expertise will be happy to assist you.\nOur Toll-Free Number is 831-901-9111, or email us at Info@PharmcoRx.com\nThe CDC has provided the following link for current developments regarding 2019-nCoV: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html .\nFor more information about Progressive Care, please visit the company\u2019s website .\nConnect and stay in touch with us on social media:\n",

Such a scenario could potentially spoil the business case and returns prospects for struggling Indian telcos to bid aggressively in a 5G airwaves sale any time soon. By Last Updated: Feb 11, 2020, 07.03 AM IST 0 Comments Getty Images KOLKATA: The government is likely to face tough times auctioning costly 5G spectrum before January-February 2021 with the deadly coronavirus outbreak in China showing no signs of abating, analysts and industry insiders said. A prolonged epidemic, they said, could slow down 5G rollouts and devices ecosystem development globally, including in India as Chinese vendors such as Huawei have been leading the charge on the 5G front. Such a scenario could potentially spoil the business case and returns prospects for struggling Indian telcos to bid aggressively in a 5G airwaves sale any time soon, they added. \u201cIf the coronavirus menace continues for a few more months, the government may find it challenging to auction expensive 5G spectrum before January-February 2021 since a prolonged epidemic would hit 5G network deployments and devices availability in India too, further reducing the business case for local telcos to participate meaningfully in any early 5G airwaves sale this year,\u201d Rajiv Sharma, research head at SBICap Securities told ET. Nitin Soni, director (corporates) at global rating agency Fitch, backed the view, saying \u201cthe continuing coronavirus outbreak in China would further delay 5G (services) in India as production of 5G network equipment at Huawei may be hit\u201d. Soni expects the next auction \u201cto be delayed anyways as 5G spectrum is expensive coupled with the limited business case for 5G (technology) in India\u201d. The government plans to offer 4G spectrum across the 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz and 2500 MHz band, besides 5G airwaves in the 3.3-3.6 GHz bands. The sale, planned in the first quarter of FY21, is slated to see some 8,293.95 units of airwaves at an estimated total base price of Rs 5.86 lakh-crore. Telcos though downplayed the coronavirus impact on 5G network rollouts in India, saying non-Chinese vendors could easily step up production levels, though they conceded devices availability could take a hit. Rajan Mathews, director general of Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), said \u201cavailability of 5G smartphones in India may be impacted\u201d if the coronavirus epidemic continues for some more months but does not foresee a serious impact on 5G rollouts. \u201cEricsson, Nokia and Samsung can collectively cater to India\u2019s 5G gear needs in case of supply challenges from Huawei and ZTE\u201d. COAI represents Big 3 telcos, Airtel, Jio and Vodafone Idea. \u201cWe are not too perturbed about the coronavirus impact as actual 5G rollouts in India are at least 18 months away, but the DoT needs to speed up clearance for the 5G trials that is held up for over a month, reduce 5G spectrum base price and include efficient 26 GHz millimetre wave spectrum in the pool of bands for the next auction to boost the 5G business case in India,\u201d said Mathews.

To date, two people in the United States are infected with the Corona Virus a man in his 30\u2019s and a woman in her 60\u2019s have been confirmed to have the Corona Virus. When this article was published at least 63 patients are under investigation for having the Corona Virus and as a result the United States has expanded screening at their international and domestic airports. As of right now hospitals are being over run with infected patients in China and the Chinese people are asking the government in Wuhan to be removed.\nI predict with this outbreak that there will be riots in China since the Chinese people do not feel that their government is protecting them well enough. Of course the government officials are protected against the virus since they have the best medical care but what about the common folks in China? You see my friends when you put too much trust in the government the government will always let you down. I suspect that some government officials here in the United States mainly Democrats would like the Corona Virus to take effect here in the United States so they can blame President Trump in an election year for not doing his job in protecting the public. It would also be a way to scare people into signing up for the failing Obama Care and it will give Elizabeth Warren a reason for her disastrous Medicare for All plan, which I have called Mediscare for All. You see the Democrats never had Americas best interest at heart and they will do anything to make President Trump look bad. I think that President Trump will have the Corona Virus under control but I would not have trusted President Obama to do anything. I would suspect that President Obama, and todays Democrats in Congress would want the Corona Virus to spread in America so they can get more people on to the Obama Care roles. ",

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) chief's analysis is drawing keen attention. \"We don't know much about the virus,\" said Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, in an interview on Sunday. \"It's probably over this season, and it's still with us this year. \"I think the virus will eventually gain a foothold and spread itself based on the community,\" he said. Corona 19 may not end up as a temporary disease. \"At the moment, we are taking an aggressive anti-proliferation approach,\" he said. There have been a total of 15 confirmed Korona 19 cases so far in the U.S. Three of them were confirmed to have been evacuated by chartered plane from Wuhan, China, where they originated. By region, there are eight cases in California, two in Illinois, and one each in Arizona, Washington, Massachusetts, Wisconsin and Texas. \"The anti-proliferation measures are actually meant to buy time,\" Redfield said. \"This virus will be a community virus this year, next year, at some point.\" He then said that while there is no evidence that the virus has actually spread to the local community, he wants to strengthen monitoring. In a related move, the U.S. has imposed restrictions on foreigners who have visited China since the outbreak of Korona 19. U.S. President Donald Trump had strongly expressed his willingness to do so. \"Our duty is to do everything we can to protect the American public,\" Redfield said. \"At this stage, it's better to be criticized for overprotecting the U.S. than for underprotecting it.\" He also warned of the possibility of Korona 19 being \"anymptotic infection.\" \"We don't know how many cases of anymptotic infection are causing the transmission,\" he said. \"We've found over the last two weeks that the spectrum of the  disease is broader than originally suggested. Meanwhile, the Chinese government has yet to accept the CDC's dispatch of experts to help prevent Korona 19 research and proliferation, it said. \"There is a lot of information we don't know,\" said Redfield said. That's why I proposed the assistance myself,\" he said, adding that \"we are ready to help them.\"",

This new coronavirus has resulted in thousands of cases of lethal disease in China, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public database and the state-of-the-art single-cell RNA-Seq technique, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the normal human lungs. The result indicates that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). Surprisingly, we found that this population of ACE2-expressing AT2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral reproduction and transmission. A comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the Asian male one has an extremely large number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung. This study provides a biological background for the epidemic investigation of the 2019-nCov infection disease, and could be informative for future anti-ACE2 therapeutic strategy development. We also noticed that the only Asian donor (male) has a much higher ACE2-expressing cell ratio than white and African American donors (2.50% vs. 0.47% of all cells). This might explain the observation that the new Coronavirus pandemic and previous SARS-Cov pandemic are concentrated in the Asian area.

It was awful.\nWhich brings me to a slightly lighter note.\nWhile I was sitting there, old mate texts me from home answering a comment I sent to her about half the airport having masks on, asking \u201cWell, where\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t make them for heads like mine,\u201d I replied.\nShe says, \u201cNot funny.\u201d\nThat was the end of the banter.\nI boarded my plane and had a really nice relaxing flight home where I contemplated that fact that for the past 18 months and a dozen trips to Bali, this was the first one that I never had one sick day.\nAwesome, I thought, as I snoozed homeward bound.\nArrived back in the hood about midnight and woke the next morning feeling a bit odd.\nWent to get up and had vertigo followed by projectile vomiting, which was distinctly green in colour and I started sweating bullets on a morning where it was about 20C.\nMy dear other half who had just kissed me had a look of \u201cget the hell away from me, I told you to wear a mask\u201d.\nSo I adjourned to the driveway with my plastic bucket. After it just continued to get worse I rang the ambulance stating, \u201cLook this is probably a false alarm but I have just come back from Bali and have blah blah blah\u201d.\nThe paramedics arrived shortly after following the proper procedures and took me off to Sunshine Coast University Hospital where I was poked, prodded and measured by the unlucky crew that picked me up.\nThe medical team ruled out coronavirus but over a period of a couple of hours I reckon I did a pretty good impression of a harp seal echoing the corridors of the hospital with some pretty wild sounds.\nI spent the day there feeling much better after treatment and some wonderful care.\nIt just reminded me, on a few fronts, how wonderful our medical and emergency staff are.\nWe are so lucky and no matter what happens with the coronavirus we need to all remain compassionate human beings.\nThank you, Queensland Health.",

The Taiwan-based company, which operates numerous factories in mainland China, announced in a statement that it is monitoring the situation but does not expect any effects on its \"manufacturing commitments\". \u201cFoxconn is monitoring the situation closely. Given the current public health challenges associated with the coronavirus, we are applying all of the recommended health and hygiene measures to all aspects of our business in the affected markets. Our facilities in China are following the holiday plans and will continue to do so until all companies have resumed normal business hours, \u201dthe company said. It refers to the Chinese government's New Year holiday extension, a measure to try to curb the spread of the virus by encouraging citizens to stay home and avoid travel. \"We can continue to meet all global manufacturing commitments.\" \"For political and commercial sensitivity reasons, we do not comment on our specific production processes,\" the company adds, \"but we can confirm that we have taken action to ensure that we can continue to meet all global manufacturing obligations. \" This particular strain of coronavirus, which health officials say has occurred in the Chinese city of Wuhan last month, has resulted in more than 1 00 deaths in China since Tuesday and more than 4,500 reported cases worldwide, although the vast majority of cases are concentrated in the Chinese province of Hubei. Due to China's massive role in global manufacturing and the large number of technology companies that rely on their factories to assemble products, the virus has also affected numerous hardware companies in Silicon Valley and beyond. Facebook, LG, and Razer have all started restricting employee travel to China, and some companies have advised employees who have recently traveled to China to work from home. The Danish game accessories manufacturer SteelSeries explains The Verge that it \"limited the travel of employees to China indefinitely\". Apple, which relies heavily on Foxconn for iPhone production, is concerned that the corona virus could disrupt its manufacturing times for upcoming smartphones and other products. Almost every new iPhone is assembled in factories operated by Foxconn's subsidiary Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. in Zhengzhou and by Taiwanese manufacturer Pegatron, which operates factories near Shanghai, according to Bloomberg . Although both manufacturers are several hundred kilometers from Wuhan, the outbreak still poses a risk, say analysts interviewed by Bloomberg . Any minor disruption to Apple's expansive and extremely complex supply chain in mainland China could lead to production delays, the report said. Apple has not yet made a public comment on the corona virus or the potential impact on its operations in China, where Apple employs more than 10,000 people in retail and corporate offices. Apple employees are also frequent flyers to China. Apple is United Airlines' largest corporate customer, which is partly due to the fact that Apple pre-orders 50 Business Class seats on the daily flight from United to Shanghai in San Francisco. However, United announced Tuesday that flights to China due to the coronavirus should be discontinued in February, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Tuesday that health examinations should be expanded to 20 US airports.",

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\nRight, Red Cross workers of Boston, Massachusetts, removing bundles of masks for American soldiers from a table where other women made them, 1918. (National Archives Identifier ) METHODS We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number. RESULTS Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9). CONCLUSIONS Since December 2019, an increasing number of cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) \u2013 infected pneumonia (NCIP) have been identified in Wuhan, a large city of 11 million people in central China. 1-3 On December 29, 2019, the first 4 cases reported, all linked to the Huanan (Southern China) Seafood Wholesale Market, were identified by local hospitals using a surveillance mechanism for \u201cpneumonia of unknown etiology\u201d that was established in the wake of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak with the aim of allowing timely identification of novel pathogens such as 2019-nCoV. 4 In recent days, infections have been identified in other Chinese cities and in more than a dozen countries around the world. 5 Relationships and Going Places , Health, Fitness and Style , News and Issues , History , Culture Watch , Health and Science , Issues , Learning , Grandparenting , Senior Women Web , Articles , Sightings",

The group of international experts, with a range of specializations, will work with Chinese counterparts on increasing understanding of the outbreak to guide global response efforts. Since being notified of the outbreak on 31 December, the WHO Country Office in China, supported by the regional and international offices, has worked to support China, and indeed the world, to scale up the response. A small mission was sent to Wuhan mid-January,and the Director-General visited in January. \u2022 Following WHO best practicesfor naming of new human infectious diseases, which were developed in consultation and collaboration with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), WHO has named the disease COVID-19, short for \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019.\u201d TECHNICAL FOCUS: Zoonotic component of 2019-nCoV and human-animal interfaceIncreasing evidences demonstrate the link between the 2019-nCoV and other similar known coronaviruses (CoV) circulating in bats, and more specifically those of the Rhinolophus bat sub-species. These sub-species are abundant and widely present in Southern China, and across Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Recent studies indicate that more than 500CoVs have been identified in bats in China. To be noted that serological studies conducted in rural population living close to bats natural habitat in caves revealed a 2.9% bat-CoV seroprevalence, demonstrating that humans exposure to bat-CoVs might be common.1 However,the route of transmission to humans at the start of this event remains unclear. Bats are rare in markets in China but hunted and sold directly to restaurants for food.2The current most likely hypothesis is that an intermediary host animal has played a role in the transmission. Both Chinese and external expert groups are working in trying to identify the animal source of this new virus. Identifying the animal source ofthe 2019-nCoV would help to ensure that there will be no further future similar outbreaks with the same virus and will also help understanding the initial spread of the disease in the Wuhan area. It would also increase our understanding of the virus and help us understand how these virusesjump from animals to humans. Thus,providing critical knowledge on how to protect us from future similar events. In this regard, strengthening food control and market hygiene activities in live food market will be essential to protect people from similar and other zoonotic diseases. ",

        "content": "As we have said, the silver ray is the feminine frequency within the body and the golden ray is the masculine frequency. When these merge or marry together (like two flints rubbing together), they create an internal fire (phire) that manifests as \u2018the rose gold ray\u2019 or \u2018rose gold flame\u2019 as it is activated. We also used the analogy of three aspects to the trinity. Each aspect being one unit of 33 and one third. We could say that the silver (female) aspect is one 33 and one third unit and the golden (male) aspect is the second 33 and one third unit. The third 33 and one third unit is the \u2018creation\u2019 or the \u2018child\u2019 (the rose gold flame). One symbol that shows this trinity field through geometry is the Celtic knot or \u2018triquetra\u2019. The twin flame presentation of the vesica piscis geometry depicts the masculine, the feminine and the creation as one aspect of the overall trinity, yet is a trinity in itself. Every aspect to each individualised, infinite structure is a holographic replica of the greater and the lesser aspect. Every structure is an \u2019emanation\u2019 of another structure. The triquetra simply shows us the expanded presentation of the vesica piscis.\nA quantum version in holographic form. Within many depictions of the triquetra, one brings a circle into the centre of the three vesica piscis geometries. This shows the aspects of the trinity and the unified whole. This depicts the entire \u2018journey\u2019 of the DNA, if you will.\nThe first exercise we show you, involving the rose gold flame and the utilisation of the Schumann resonance as the antidote to the 5G scrambled field and the black box programme, is to use the symbol of the triquetra. There are several ways this can be done.\nMeditation\nFirstly, you can meditate upon the triquetra simply by visualising the symbol within meditation. You can also move into an \u2018open-eyed\u2019 meditation where you are in a relaxed, meditative space whilst looking at the triquetra symbol. You can also look at the symbol as the very last image you look at before you go to sleep at night. This is especially helpful if you wish to use dream magick and dream healing as part of your antidote creation. If you do decide to use the triquetra symbol as a trigger into dreamtime investigation/magick and healing, then you must \u2018prepare your sleeping space\u2019 before you do this. If you are sleeping outdoors in nature, there is no need to prepare your space as nature has already done this for you. Indoors, you would need to make sure all Wi-Fi and Internet signals are turned off in your home and all electronic equipment is removed from your bedroom. Make sure there is no metal within the mattress or bed frame you sleep upon, and do your best to utilise chemical-free bedding. Having crystals in your bedroom is especially helpful. Orgonite also.\nWithin your meditation or visualisation (closed or open-eyed looking at the triquetra image), imagine that the triquetra is a brilliant and bright silver colour. Make sure you hold that beautiful silver colour in your mind\u2019s eye. You should feel an opening of the heart when doing this. Then imagine that the triquetra symbol is becoming a golden colour, getting brighter and brighter until all the silver colour has now been replaced with the gold. Then visualise the gold changing colour, taking on a pink hue and eventually becoming rose gold in colour. This is a very simple but very powerful exercise. This will trigger \u2018downloads\u2019 within dreamtime or meditation if you are a natural medium or channel. This exercise in itself can bring about balance and natural healing.\nTo strengthen and boost this exercise, you can keep rose quartz crystal by your bedside. A crystal wand or a crystal skull holds even more powerful, activating energy.\nA quantum version in holographic form. Within many depictions of the triquetra, one brings a circle into the centre of the three vesica piscis geometries. This shows the aspects of the trinity and the unified whole. This depicts the entire \u2018journey\u2019 of the DNA, if you will.\nShields that connect into Schumann resonance fields can also be created through water. Swimming in natural ocean water is an extremely powerful shield as the Schumann resonance is amplified through the oceans upon your planet. This can be recreated within your own bathtubs at home using Himalayan salts or any magnesium-based salts. Certain aromatherapy creations and herbs can also create shielding, as can placing crystals within the bathtub. The only case where it is not advisable to create a water shield in your bathtub, is when your bath is made of metal. This would scramble the signal and have the opposite effect (as in, lack of shield and focus away from Schumann resonance). The most powerful material for creating a water shield is stone such as crystal, followed by wood. A crystal bathtub full of sea salt is an absolute replica of the ocean and creates a \u2018super conductor\u2019 directly into the Schumann resonance fields. We also recommend you utilise a heavy metal detoxification programme. The reason for this is that metals within the organic human body system can \u2018lock. on\u2019 to the Wi-Fi 5G scrambled system and amplify it, so cleansing from heavy metals within the body is a shield in itself. The dark green leafy vegetables from the land and the seaweeds from unpolluted waters are able to chelate these heavy metals from the body. We recommend the blue-green algae also, such as chlorella and spirulina.\nWhen you visualise the rose gold flame, you create an image in your mind\u2019s eye that \u2018activates\u2019 through the pineal gland visual cortex system. The rose gold (and indeed the symbol of the rose itself) is a known symbol within what we may call the \u2018cosmic alphabet\u2019 or the \u2018language of light\u2019. When you visualise the rose gold flame, you speak directly to the DNA. When you create the rose gold flame as a shield, then the molecular structure within your body as silicate/crystalline follows suit (through a process similar to that which is known as \u2018cymatics\u2019and your entire energy field naturally keys into the Schumann resonance.\nIf enough individuals hold this belief system and follow similar spiritual exercises, then collectively the Schumann resonance will be spiked and kept at a high enough frequency to \u2018drown out\u2019 the 5G network and chemical bombardment. Either in meditation or in a relaxed state, we would ask you to visualise a silver candle and a gold candle. Both these candles burn one flame each. The silver candle burns a golden flame. The gold candle burns a silver flame. Sit with this visualisation for a few minutes, simply watching the candles and the burning flames. This exercise balances the right and left hemispheres of the brain, as well as communicating directly with the DNA about the shielding technique you are employing. The intrinsic intelligence within the cellular structure of the entire bodymind knows what you are doing. After a while, we would ask you to draw the candles closer and closer together until the silver candle burning a golden flame and the gold candle burning a silver flame become one candle and one flame. As the candles merge together, gold and silver, the colour of the candle begins to turn a beautiful rose colour with a matching rose coloured flame.\nYet The sparkle of the gold remains, creating a rose gold colour. You are now watching a rose gold candle burning a rose gold flame, and you are fully aware that the rose gold is a merge of the silver and the gold. Know that the right hemisphere of the brain (silver) and the left hemisphere of the brain (gold) have created a unified brain pattern, where the left and right hemispheres are in equal balance. Within the pineal gland, a beautiful diamond liquid crystal of a metallic rose gold colour has been created. This rose gold crystal liquid then seeps down from the brain stem into the throat, and you visualise yourself drinking this rose gold liquid. Know that this is \u2018ambrosia\u2019 or indeed \u2018nectar of the Gods\u2019. As you drink this delicious and sweet nectar, you visualise the flame of the rose gold candle getting bigger and bigger. The rose gold flame begins to surround you, like a ring of fire around you. The candle has unified with the flame and now, sitting in sacred space, there is just you surrounded by the rose gold flame ring of fire. Allow this ring of fire to completely surround you until it eventually becomes a ball of fire, like a rose-gold-pink orb, with you sitting in the centre, nurtured and protected.\nWith thanks to Magenta Pixie\u2019TheBlack Box programme and the Rose Gold Flame\u2019\nU",

The head of France's health department, Jerome Salomon, said Saturday evening that all three are doing \"very well.\" Still, France remained concerned about its citizens in Wuhan, the now-locked down Chinese city where the outbreak began. France's Foreign Ministry said Saturday that French and Chinese officials were studying \"eventual options that would allow our nationals who wish to leave.\" The French consulate in Wuhan is in constant contact with citizens, the Foreign Ministry said, without saying how many of them are in the city. Starting Sunday, medical teams will be at France's airports, notably Paris' Charles de Gaulle, to help passengers arriving from various Chinese cities with questions, concerns or medical needs, health chief Salomon said. The virus so far has infected more than 1,200 people and killed at least 41. The vast majority of the infections and all the deaths have been in mainland China.

France has announced three confirmed cases of the deadly new virus from China, the first cases in Europe and the first outside Asia and the United States. One of people who caught the virus is hospitalized in the southwestern city of Bordeaux. The others are in Paris. (AP Photo/Michel Euler) Dr. Yazdan Yazdanpaneh said the two patients at Paris' Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital are a couple from Wuhan, where the viral respiratory illness first was detected. The 31-year-old man and 30-year-old woman arrived in France on Jan. 18 without symptoms, but one developed symptoms the next day and the other soon followed, the doctor said. The two are staying in separate, specially equipped rooms and are doing well, physically and psychologically, Yazdanpaneh said. He could not speculate when they might be released from the hospital. Ways in which the virus can be transmitted remain unclear. Yazdanpaneh, a leading French expert who heads Bichat's infectious diseases unit, said that cases imported from China were \"not a surprise\" and that France had prepared, including by developing a test that provides rapid results for suspected cases.

The mortality rate for the viral illness identified in China last month is currently thought to be less than 5%, whereas it was double that for SARS, he said.

It shows all patients confirmed, suspected and recovered by coronaviruses as well as deaths. The coronavirus originating from Wuhan, China, has so far killed 41 people and infected almost 1,000. Cases have been confirmed in the United States and Europe in which the disease showed pneumonia symptoms. It was first reported to the World Health Organization on December 31, when Chinese scientists linked the disease to a family of viruses known as coronaviruses, which include lethal SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\nAt the time of publication, the dashboard displayed 916 confirmed cases in mainland China, five in Thailand, three each in Singapore and Taiwan, and two in Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, South Korea, the United States, Vietnam, and France.  Australia's first case of coronavirus has also been confirmed since then, with the patient kept in isolation in a Melbourne hospital. According to ABC News in Australia, five more people are being tested for the virus in New South Wales.",

        "content": "Chinese molecular biologists have found out that one of the antibodies discovered during the 2003 atypical pneumonia epidemic can neutralize the coronavirus that sparked the pneumonia outbreak in China and a number of other nations, says an article published in bioRxiv internet library.\n\u201cWe report for the first time that [\u2026] CR3022 could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD,\u201d the scientists write in their article. \u201cInterestingly, some of the most potent [\u2026] antibodies (e.g., m396, CR3014) [\u2026] failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein.\u201d\nThis discovery, according to the scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and Fudan University in Shanghai, gives hope that CR3022 compound, combined with other antibodies that can bind with the new coronavirus, would allow to create the first effective remedies for the novel pneumonia and stop the epidemics.\nThe scientists have come to this conclusion after they observed how the copy of the RBD protein, which the Chinese virus uses to infiltrate human cells, interacts with various antibodies discovered in patient bodies or created during the 2003 atypical pneumonia outbreak.\nThese viruses are closely related and their RBD proteins are similar, which, the scientists presumed, allowed for a slight chance that these old molecules would also neutralize the new pathogen. On the one hand, those hopes were fulfilled with the CR3022, but the four other antibodies, including the synthetic cure m336, created several years ago in the Wuhan Institute of Virology, failed to react to the viral protein.\nThis discovery has greatly surprised the scientists, since computer models did not indicate that slight RBD differences would make the 2019-nCoV invulnerable to those protein molecules. The scientists now study the infected blood samples, in hopes to find other antibodies that would bind with the coronavirus more effectively than the CR3022 does. The novel coronavirus\nOn December 31, 2019, Chinese authorities informed the World Health Organization (WHO) about an outbreak of an unknown pneumonia in the city of Wuhan \u2014 a large trade and industrial center in central China populated by 11 million people. On January 7, Chinese experts identified the infecting agent: coronavirus 2019-nCoV.\nAccording to recent data, over 6,000 people have been infected with the virus, with 132 people dead. The virus continues to spread in China and other states, including Australia, Vietnam, Italy, Germany, Cambodia, Malaysia, Nepal, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, the US, Thailand, France, Sri Lanka and Japan.\nThe new virus belongs to the same group as the coronavirus of the well-known severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Both viruses have claimed lives of several hundred people in the Middle East and East Asia, causing repeated epidemics, spread through camels and poultry. The initial carriers of the 2019-nCoV virus were bats, the scientists believe.\nAll three pathogens relate to the so-called coronaviruses. They cause similar symptoms: fever, cough, trouble breathing and constant phlegm production. The incubation period is up to 12 days, followed by the strongest fever. Most lethal cases happened due to exhaustion, complications and accompanying infections when left unattended.\nfrom https://tass.com/science/1114179",

        "content": "The biggest threat to our collective humanity today is not the suspected threat of a Third World War, but a corrosive, debilitating, murderous pathogen known as new Corona Virus. The fear of World War III was fuelled by tensions and differences among key superpowers dictating contemporary geo-politics notably: the US, China, Iran, Iraq, Israel, North Korea, South Korea, and the entire Middle East. But while relationships with the world\u2019s power axis will always have implications for global peace, security and stability, the biggest and the most urgent threat by far is the outbreak of a new strain of the Corona Virus, in Wuhan, China which has within a short space of one month shown the vulnerability of man, the conflict between man and biology, and the limitations of science in the face of an immediate, accidental, unforeseeable, pathogenic onslaught. The first case of Corona Virus was reported just before the Chinese Lunar New Year 2020 celebrations, and since then, the new virus has defied both man and science. On January 28, the highest number of reported cases was reported, but by Monday, February 10, that had jumped exponentially to 97 casualties per day and total cases in excess of 40, 000, with 908 persons reported dead. The statistics and the seroprevalence rate seem unprecedented, far worse than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome of 2003 which claimed 774 lives. The World Health Organization has classified the new Corona Virus as a public health emergency of international concern, a delicate, diplomatic phrasing which barely stops short of declaring the nCoV-2019, as it is otherwise known, a global pandemic \u2013 considering the fact that mainland China, especially Wuhan, a city of 11 million people and the Hubei province in general, remains the epicenter \u2013 99% of reported cases are in mainland China and out of the total number of deaths, only two have occurred outside China. The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) has commended China for its efforts at prevention and containment, even if the Politburo, the highest political body in China has had to express regrets for \u201cfailing\u201d the people. The truth is: China is overwhelmed. Businesses have been affected, the stock market is down, lives are threatened, over 40 million people are in quarantine. China is engaging the world as the epicenter of a crisis, the global economy is likely to be affected given China\u2019s strategic importance, and yet nobody knows when the Coronavirus will ease off, or when scientists will find a cure. It is not only China that is at risk, but it is also the entire world. Our civilization is under threat and of course, the tragedy is man-made. These are the cold, uncomfortable facts at the time of this writing. The Corona Virus has brought the entire world to the precipice of uncertainty and disaster. It reminds us collectively of our mortality and the common humanity and vulnerability that we share. Globalization turned the world into a small village, technology erased distances, but in the face of a global scourge like the new Corona Virus, the world has turned into a much smaller village. Most of the people and countries that are taking precautions against Corona Virus don\u2019t even know where Wuhan is on the map. Some people ate snake meat or are it Pangolin or bat meat in Wuhan and they got infected with a virus \u2013 animal to man transmission, which has now spread to over 27 countries and mutated as a deadly human-to-human communicable disease. China which is ordinarily regarded as a major superpower has suddenly become a pariah nation. Countries have issued travel alerts to their citizens: do not go to China, and those who are in China are being evacuated and whoever arrives from China is immediately quarantined for two weeks. This is the same China that only recently engaged the United States in a trade war. Same China is now the diseased nation that nobody wants to touch. Imports from China have been suspended. Trips to China have been put on hold. China\u2019s tourism industry is bound to suffer. Who wants to go to a country where a virus is on a rampage, and the air is polluted? It is not for nothing that the media in Europe has dubbed the Corona Virus, the China Virus \u2013 an average Chinese citizen would not like that \u2013 but the truth is that the new Corona Virus wears the toga of a nationality. Before it, there was the Swine flu (2009), Polio (2014), Zika (2016), Ebola (2014, 2019) but it is the new Corona Virus that has obtained a national passport and an identification tag of notorious universal recognition. This may have translated into racist conclusions about Chinese identity and cuisine. I have heard allegations that the Chinese eat anything and everything, including animals that are considered taboo in many cultures \u2013 Bats? Cockroaches? Rats? Snakes? Millipedes and centipedes? Monkeys? Pangolin? E-eeish! It is said that the Chinese have brought this latest biological dissonance upon humanity because of their unusual culinary taste. I know people who have simply opted to stay away from anything Chinese in the meantime until there is some certainty about what exactly is going on. I wanted to order food from a Chinese restaurant the other day. I was quietly reminded of Corona Virus. I had no option but to restrain my palate. I wanted Chinese balm, a popular product in Nigeria, a few days later. I was also advised to be careful. I ignored that advice. The labeling of everything Chinese as an item crowned by a virus is exaggerated and overblown. But as Nigerians would say in pidgin English: who wan die? This is probably why every country and institution is taking precautions. The United Kingdom, Australia, South Korea, Singapore, and New Zealand have had cause to evacuate their citizens from China. Airlines including Finnair, American Airlines, United, Cathay Pacific, Air India, Ethiopian Airlines, British Airways, Air Asia, and Lufthansa have either stopped flights to China or reduced their Chinese operations by 90%. The effect is that supply chains have been disrupted with consequences for trade performance. The global economy is bound to slow down in the long run if this situation persists. But what is perhaps more relevant to us should be this: How prepared is Africa and particularly Nigeria? I don\u2019t think Africa is prepared at all, and we are likely to be worst hit should the virus make an effective landing in our continent. For now, across Africa, we have only heard of suspected cases: in Ghana where there were two suspected cases involving a Chinese and an Argentine who returned from China, but the result was negative in both cases. Suspected cases in Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Kenya, and Botswana have also proven negative. The only reported case of infection involving an African is that of a Cameroonian student living in Wuhan. Kenya has taken steps to evacuate its students in China. Mozambique has suspended its visa on arrival policy. Africa and South America seem insulated from the scourge so far. But for how much longer? The Chinese Lunar New Year Holiday was extended, in the face of the outbreak of the virus, but that holiday ended yesterday, Monday, February 10. Using that as a guide, if there were any Chinese living in Africa or doing business in Africa, he or she is likely to return to base after the holiday. In the last decade or more, Sino-African relationship has grown tremendously, China seeking to fill a vacuum inadvertently created by the EU and the United States has increased its scope of influence in Africa through friendly loans, investments, and cultural outreach. It is not an accident that African leaders at the just concluded 33 rd AU Heads of State Summit in Addis Ababa expressed solidarity with China! The Chinese presence in Africa is unmistakable and it is quite pronounced in a country like Nigeria where the Chinese are involved in significant sectors of the economy including oil and gas, telecommunications, manufacturing, infrastructure, SMEs and retail trade. This week, all the Chinese who went home on holiday will start returning one after the other. When the story of the Corona Virus broke, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) was most unusually proactive, which I think is commendable. The Federal Ministry of Health quickly followed suit, to educate Nigerians about the threat of the Corona Virus. Preventive guidelines were announced, and a travel advisory was issued. This is indeed commendable, even if the efforts were not translated into local, indigenous languages, that is \u2013 the languages of the majority of Nigerians. The campaign has thus far been so elitist and restricted. In due course, the Nigerian authorities further announced that the Federal Government had established eight isolation centers as follows: in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and seven states of the Federation \u2013 Lagos, Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Enugu, Delta, Cross River, and Kano. The problem is that nobody knows exactly where these isolation centers are located. The relevant authorities tell us that in preparing for the Corona Virus which has not yet been reported in Nigeria, they are relying on the protocols and infrastructure already put in place in 2014 to combat the Ebola Virus. In 2014, Nigeria was confronted with the Ebola Virus crisis, introduced to the country by a traveler from Liberia who came to Nigeria to seek a spiritual cure for Ebola. Knowledge and experience can definitely prove useful in everything including a biological and pharmaceutical crisis such as Corona Virus. But has Nigeria done enough or is Nigeria prepared? I don\u2019t think so. There is definitely no evidence that we have enough medical countermeasures to protect the medical and public health personnel who are supposed to man our ports. A gentleman who just returned from Chicago reported on live television and I have no cause to doubt him, that the situation at the Murtala Muhammad International Airport in Lagos, to cite a specific example, is chaotic and below standard practice. Government officials pretend to check for high temperature and other symptoms but they are not protected. Nigeria has not made any provision for medical countermeasures. Nigeria is sending medical personnel and Ministry officials to the ports to put them at risk. Until we have another case of Stella Adadevoh, like Li Weliang, the Chinese whistleblower who paid the supreme price for Corona Virus, the Nigerian government is not likely to wake up. That is unacceptable. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and the Federal Ministry of Health and state governments have to do a lot more. I will comment on the latter. As at this moment, only three states \u2013 Lagos, Ebonyi, and Ogun out of the 36 states of the Federation would seem to have shown interest in the Corona Virus prevention campaign. We expect every state of the Federation, close as they are to the grassroots, to take up the campaign and inform the populace appropriately. At the national level, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and the Federal Ministry of Health will also need to address what has become around the subject of Corona Virus, an \u201cinfodemic crisis\u201d \u2013 that is the crisis of conspiracy theories and misinformation and hazardous false information. Is the Corona Virus a biological weapon?. Really? Is it a strategy by big pharmaceutical companies to enlarge the market and increase profit? President Donald Trump and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have also been linked to the conspiracy. Does that make sense? We have also been told that eating garlic or drinking a bleach concoction can help prevent a Corona Virus infection. Is that true? The Nigerian agencies are yet to respond to this. They should. They should take the additional step of addressing the spiritual question which determines everything in Nigeria from politics to business. Is Corona Virus a spiritual affliction or biology gone awry? If care is not taken, Nigerian shamanists, prophets, traditionalists, and pastors will soon take advantage of the uncertainty to claim that they had predicted the occurrence of the virus and that, indeed they have the solution. The government should immediately arrest anyone who mouths such idiocy. Our only hope is that the Corona Virus will never make its way here, but as the Boys Scouts motto states, we should \u201cBe Prepared\u201d. The bad news is that there is no effective treatment for the virus. And a worse virus may soon show up, leaving humanity effectively at the mercy of disease and the environment. II: Asisat Oshoala, the Super Star When Asisat Oshoala, the Super Falcons and Barcelona Ferminino striker was declared the winner of the African Women\u2019s Footballer of the Year, 2019, a few weeks ago, the big concern was that her own compatriots who sat on the Confederation of Africa Football judges panel refused to vote for her. Every single one of them voted for an outsider. They didn\u2019t consider their own compatriot good enough. I have addressed this matter at length in a piece titled \u201cThe Betrayal of Asisat Oshoala,\u201d (This Day, back page, January 14). At the time, Ms. Oshoala lost her cool momentarily and tried to engage her critics which were absolutely unnecessary. But the best response that she has offered, and the one that is relevant, is how, after returning to her club in Europe, she has been putting up such sterling performance that further confirms her status as a superstar on the pitch. In January, she won the Africa Football Women\u2019s Player of the year to equal the record of fellow Nigerian Perpetua Nkwocha. With her current performance, Oshoala does not want to just equal the existing record, she wants to break the record in African Women\u2019s Football. After winning the CAF award in January she reportedly said: \u201c\u2026I want to create my own history and not just equal someone else\u2019s record \u2013 I\u2019m going to give my best to create mine.\u201d She is doing just that right now. Five-time winner of the Women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations, best player at the 2014 FIFA U-20 Women\u2019s World Cup, winner of the BBC Footballer of the Year, 2015, Chinese Women\u2019s Super League Top Scorer, 2017, she scored a brace in Barcelona\u2019s 10\u20131 trouncing and humiliation of Real Sociedad in the Spanish Women\u2019s League Super Cup Final on February 9, 2020. Loaned to Barcelona from China in January 2019, and later offered a permanent transfer, Asisat Oshoala has been a formidable and result-oriented member of the Barca line up and one of its most valuable players. On January 11, 2020, four days after the CAF awards, Oshoala scored four goals in a 6-0 win against CD Tacon. She has been consistent since then. Whoever has any doubt about her achievements and quality may end up voting for her someday soon. Congratulations Asisat. Keep shooting. Keep shining.",

        "content": "Since mid-January, the coronavirus has been keeping the world on tenterhooks. A city with over a million inhabitants is under quarantine, British Airways has suspended all flights to China and even Upper Bavaria is not immune to the virus. In China, 6,000 people have already become infected and more than one hundred deaths have been reported. Even stock markets do not appear to be immune to the coronavirus. The Shanghai Composite Index fell by more than three percent within two weeks and prices on the US stock exchanges are also under pressure.\nStock markets are particularly prone to narratives - short stories that convey emotions and values. The image of a deadly virus that spreads at breakneck speed, for which doctors know no cure and from which no one seems safe, is a powerful narrative. A further spread of the virus could also bring public life to a standstill in our country and cause a worldwide recession.The argumentation sounds plausible, films suggest how realistic such a scenario seems to be, and the news and social media ensure the appropriate distribution. The narrative about the virus ultimately spreads like a virus itself.The question arises now as to how long the narrative will continue to have an influence on the stock markets. The further development of the pandemic is decisive for this, as it is the source of media reports. In order to predict the spread of a viral disease, so-called SEIR models can be used and estimated based on the already observed infection rate, incubation period and recovery rate. The model predicts the peak of the pandemic for the end of February. A rapid decline afterwards could then be expected.\nHowever, it should be noted that model-based forecasts must be treated with caution. Model accuracy and the data base have a high influence on the result and can quickly lead to misjudgements. Preventive measures such as travel restrictions and reduced contact with fellow citizens can also significantly reduce the number of new infections.Stock markets also reacted strongly to the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in spring 2003, which was much more likely to be fatal. From February to April 2003, the Hang Seng Index fell by six percent. However, by early summer of that year, when the pandemic appeared to be abating and the media reported significantly less, the Hang Seng Index was already eight percent higher than before the outbreak became known.The assumption that the coronavirus narrative will also only have a temporary influence on the stock markets does not seem to be far-reaching. In comparison, the wave of influenza in 2017/2018 has cost more than thirty times as many lives in Germany alone as the SARS virus has cost worldwide.2 However, there was no sign of any impact on the stock markets - after all, the corresponding narrative was also missing.",

The concern is that it could spread to countries with weaker health systems. The UN agency said the new coronavirus has been exported to more than a dozen countries, now including India and the Philippines which have the latest cases. The agency defines an international emergency as an \u201cextraordinary event\u201d that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response, according to the Associated Press. The coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China in late December. To date, China has reported more than 7,800 cases including 170 deaths. Eighteen other countries have since reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is. There is now evidence that the virus is spreading among people in China and health experts have noted with concern instances in other countries \u2014 including the United States, France, Japan, Germany, Canada, and Vietnam \u2014 where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human transmission. \u201cThis declaration is not a vote of non-confidence in China...on the contrary, WHO continues to have the confidence in China\u2019s capacity to control the outbreak,\u201d the WHO chief said. With WHO declaring a global health emergency comes certain requirements and typically the declaration also brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. The announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries. Several countries, including the United States, Japan and some in the European Union, are evacuating their citizens from Wuhan. The United Kingdom was given the green light to fly nationals home in the early hours of Friday morning after a long delay. A number of other countries, including Russia and Mongolia, have closed their borders while many airlines are suspending flights to and from China. This is a developing story.",

This brings the cases reported in Europe to four. The cases in France had a direct link to Wuhan, China.\nBased on current information, the infection in Germany followed a close contact with a visitor from China during a stay in Germany (diagnosed with 2019-nCoV after return to China) who had previously been visited by relatives from the Wuhan area. The German authorities are investigating this case and taking the necessary steps to trace and inform any contacts.\nAt this stage of the on-going outbreak in the Hubei province in China, it is likely that there will be more imported cases in Europe. As a consequence, it could be expected to see (limited) local transmission in Europe. A single detected case in Europe does not change the overall picture for Europe, nor does it change the assessment that there is currently a moderate likelihood of importation of cases of 2019-nCoV to the EU/EEA. As more and more cases are reported globally, this also increases the probability of sporadically imported cases to EU/EEA countries.\nBased on this, EU/EEA countries should ensure that timely and rigorous infection prevention and control measures (IPC) are applied around any detected nCoV cases in the EU/EEA, in order to prevent further spread in the community and healthcare settings. Healthcare workers in the EU/EEA need to be aware and vigilant in order to detect possible nCoV cases early and apply appropriate infection control measures when handling patients.\nRight now, the focus still should be on the development of the outbreak in China and the related information on the characteristics of the virus.\nThe source of infection is unknown and could still be active. Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed but more information is needed to evaluate the full extent of this mode of transmission and understanding how the virus spreads. As this is a rapidly evolving situation, ECDC is revising its risk assessment for Europe.",

        "content": "CNN goes to ground zero of Wuhan coronavirus outbreak in China 02:45 Super spreaders are a crucial part of a disease outbreak. Think about Mary Mallon, or \"Typhoid Mary,\" who was responsible for widely spreading typhoid in New York City in the early 1900s. Or the Chinese doctor who in 2003 spread SARS , or severe acute respiratory syndrome, to four different countries. Or the single patient at a South Korean hospital who in 2015 infected 82 people with MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome. The Wuhan virus is a cousin of SARS and MERS. All three are coronaviruses. Wuhan coronavirus death toll rises to 17 with 547 infected says China, sparking fears of wider spread The presence of a super spreader in Wuhan indicates that the virus can spread with some ease, said Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist and professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. He calls them \"super shedders,\" since they shed the virus -- for example, in sneezes or coughs -- in larger quantities than most other people. \"You only need one super shedder to say, 'This dog is going to hunt,' \" he said. \"It really does speak to the potential for this virus to be transmitted.\" He added that there are probably more super spreaders -- or shedders -- of the Wuhan coronavirus than this one patient. \"If we have one super shedder, that tells us we're going to have more super shedders,\" he said. \"If there's one, there will be more.\" A visual guide to the Wuhan coronavirus Osterholm's team at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy is investigating the super spreader, and their research shows there might be more health care workers in or near Wuhan who've become infected than the 14 mentioned by the health official earlier this week. Super spreaders in coronavirus outbreaks On Tuesday, the mayor of Wuhan said one patient spread the coronavirus to a doctor and 13 nurses. The deadly new coronavirus has reached the US. Here's how to protect yourself The mayor, Zhou Xianwang, said a patient wasn't screened for the virus before being admitted to Union Hospital in Wuhan for neurosurgery, and after surgery developed a fever. Zhou, who spoke on CCTV, the state-run television station, did not specify when this occurred. Osterholm said his team's research shows that 20 health care workers have been infected by patients, with the other six cases possibly at hospitals in Wuhan and the nearby city of Huanggang. Public health officials are trying to avoid devastating super spreader events that happened with SARS and MERS. In 2003, a Chinese doctor who was staying at the Metropole Hotel in the city of Guangzhou infected other hotel guests who then traveled back to Vietnam, Hong Kong, Singapore and Canada. In Singapore alone, 94 cases of SARS can be traced back to the hotel, according to WHO . In 2015, there were five super-spreading events of MERS at hospitals in South Korea. In one case, a single patient spread the infection to 82 other people. The ramifications were huge. Two South Korean hospitals closed down, nearly 17,000 people had to be quarantined , and the economic loss was estimated at 9.3 trillion Korean won, or $8.5 billion. In all, 186 people became infected in the South Korea MERS outbreak and 38 died, according to WHO . ",

        "content": "Scientists are baffled by how the coronavirus attacks the body - killing many patients while barely affecting others.\nBut some are tantalized by a clue: A disproportionate number of patients hospitalized by COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, have high blood pressure. Theories about why the condition makes them more vulnerable - and what patients should do about it - have sparked a fierce debate among scientists over the impact of widely prescribed blood-pressure drugs.\nResearchers agree that the life-saving drugs affect the same pathways that the novel coronavirus takes to enter the lungs and heart. They differ on whether those drugs open the door to the virus or protect against it. Resolving that question has taken on new urgency after an April 8 report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that 72% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients 65 or older had hypertension.\nThe drugs are known as ACE inhibitors and ARBs, broad categories that include Vasotec, Valsartan, Irbesartan, as well as their generic versions. In a recent interview with a medical journal, Anthony Fauci - the U.S. government's top infectious disease expert - cited a report showing similarly high rates of hypertension among COVID-19 patients who died in Italy and suggested the medicines, rather than the underlying condition, may act as an accelerant for the virus.\nEfforts to understand how the virus uses the pathway to the heart and lungs, and the role of the medicines, are complicated by a lack of rigorous studies.\n\"There are millions of Americans that take an ACE inhibitor or AR daily,\" said Dr Caleb Alexander, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness in Baltimore. \"This is one of the most important clinical questions.\"\nAn estimated 100 million U.S. residents suffer from high blood pressure, which increases the risk of heart disease, stroke and kidney failure. About four-fifths of them need to take prescription drugs to control it, according to the CDC. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are widely prescribed to patients with congestive heart failure, diabetes or kidney disease. The drugs account for billions of dollars in prescription sales worldwide.\nThe absence of clear answers on how the drugs impact COVID-19 patients has sparked rampant speculation in correspondence and editorials posted on medical journal websites and those where scientists share unreviewed, pre-publication study drafts.\nMany patients are agonizing over whether their medicines will help or hurt them. Doris Kertzner, 88, of Redding, Conn., said she has carefully followed experts' guidelines for preventing infection and keeps her distance from others in her retirement community. Now she has a new worry: She takes losartan, an ARB, and can't decide whether to stop.\nDropping the medicine \"presents its own problems\" in dealing with her high blood pressure.\n\"It's gotten very complicated,\" she said.\nDr Carlos M. Ferrario - a researcher at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine and co-author of widely cited studies on ACE inhibitors - understands patients' plight.\n\"There is a lot of paranoia and a lot of speculation with very little fundamental, convincing information,\" he said.\nThe National Institutes of Health in the United States has put out a call seeking proposals for studies into the issue. An independent consortium of researchers has launched a global study to analyze health records for thousands of COVID-19 patients in the United States, Europe and Asia. That project is part of the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics program, an open-source research platform that enables large-scale studies.\nDr Marc Suchard - a biostatistician at the University of California, Los Angeles who is leading the study - said that it aims to determine whether the medicines make infections more likely or more severe - or, by contrast, whether they help protect against the virus. Suchard said he expects a preliminary report within two weeks.\nMORE TARGETS FOR THE VIRUS\nThere is evidence that the drugs may increase the presence of an enzyme - ACE2 - that produces hormones that lower blood pressure by widening blood vessels. That's normally a good thing. But the coronavirus also targets ACE2 and has developed spikes that can latch on to the enzyme and penetrate cells, researchers have found. So more enzymes provide more targets for the virus, potentially increasing the chance of infection or making it more severe.\nOther evidence, however, suggests the infection's interference with ACE2 may lead to higher levels of a hormone that causes inflammation, which can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, a dangerous build-up of fluid in the lungs. In that case, ARBs may be beneficial because they block some of the hormone's damaging effects.\nNovartis International AG and Sanofi SA are among the major drugmakers selling ACE inhibitors and ARBs.\nSanofi spokesman Nicolas Kressmann said that patients should consult their doctors on whether to continue taking the drugs but that the company has found insufficient evidence that they worsen COVID-19 through its own assessment of available scientific data.\nThe company reviewed several recent studies from China that came to conflicting conclusions about whether COVID-19 patients with hypertension fare worse than other patients, he said.\nNovartis has not issued any guidance to clinicians or patients and defers to scientists studying the issue, said spokesman Eric Althoff.\nResearchers and doctors generally agree that people with severe hypertension or heart failure should keep taking the drugs because of the high risks of stopping. The debate centers on how to advise the many patients with milder conditions who take the drugs. Two camps have emerged - one calling for no action unless the drugs are proven dangerous, the other for some limits on their use until they are proven safe.\nThe Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at University of Oxford in England has recommended that clinicians consider withdrawing the medicines in patients with mild hypertension if they are in a high risk group, such as medical workers - and replacing them with alternative blood pressure-lowering drugs.\nThe New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) took the opposite tack, highlighting the drugs' potential in fighting coronavirus and recommending patients continue taking the drugs until more about the risks is known. Several of the scientists who co-authored it had done extensive, industry-supported research on antihypertensive drugs.\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST\nDr Kevin Kavanagh, founder of Health Watch USA, a patient advocacy organization, questioned whether scientists who are funded by the drug industry should be advising clinicians, given the high stakes.\n\"You need to consider stepping back, and let others without a conflict of interest try to make a call,\" Kavanagh said.\nHis organization recommends that doctors temporarily avoid putting new patients on the drugs and warn those currently on them to take extreme precautions to avoid virus exposure.\nDr Scott David Solomon, a co-author of the NEJM article, conducts industry-financed research but said it has no influence on his position.\n\"Not only is there no compelling evidence that we should be discontinuing those medications, but there's reason to think that doing so might actually cause harm,\" said Solomon, who is the director of noninvasive cardiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\nThe lack of consensus leaves doctors to navigate the issue patient by patient. Alexander, of Johns Hopkins, is trying to strike a balance in his own practice. Patients with more severe blood-pressure problems may need to keep taking the medicines, he said, while patients with milder or newly diagnosed cases could instead take one of the \"literally dozens\" of alternative hypertension treatments.\n\"Rest assured,\" he said, \"there are dozens of scientific teams working feverishly to put this question to bed.\"",

        "content": "The UK is investigating a number of suspected cases, while officials there are trying to trace around 2,000 people who have recently flown to the UK from Hubei province. The virus has also now spread to Europe, with three cases confirmed in France.\nWhat is Coronavirus The name for this kind of virus comes from the crownlike spikes it has on its surface \u2014 \u201ccorona\u201d is Latin for \u201ccrown.\u201d Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that infect mostly bats, pigs and small mammals. In rare cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHow does it spread Like other coronaviruses \u2013 such as the common cold \u2013 the virus is spread via droplets when a person coughs or sneezes. It can also be spread when someone touches a contaminated surface such as a door handle.\nHospitals are also key locations for \u201csuper spreading\u201d events \u2013 when a single patient infects many people. When patients arrive in hospital with vague respiratory symptoms health workers may not know they need to take special precautions such as wearing masks or keeping them away from other patients.\nThe outbreak originates from animals and the source is thought to be a seafood market in Wuhan which also traded in other live animals such as marmots and bats.\nHow to prevent Coronavirus There is no vaccine to protect against this family of viruses, at least not yet. Trials for a MERS vaccine are underway. The US National Institutes of Health is working on a vaccine against the new virus, but it will be months until clinical trials get underway and more than a year until it might become available.\nYou may be able to reduce your risk of infection by avoiding people who are sick. Try to avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Wash your hands often with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds. Awareness is key.\nIf you are sick and have reason to believe it may be the Wuhan coronavirus due to travel to the region or coming into contact with someone who has been there, you should let a health care provider know and seek treatment early.Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze, and disinfect the objects and surfaces you touch.If traveling to China, be aware of symptoms and avoid living in animal markets, which is where the latest outbreak began in Wuhan.\nSymptoms of Coronavirus The viruses can make people sick, usually with a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness, similar to a common cold. Coronavirus symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, possibly a headache and maybe a fever, which can last for a couple of days.\nThree to four out of every 10 patients infected with MERS died, according to the CDC. Severe acute respiratory syndrome, also known as SARS, is the other coronavirus that can cause more severe symptoms. First identified in the Guangdong province in southern China, according to the WHO, it causes respiratory problems but can also cause diarrhea, fatigue, shortness of breath, respiratory distress and kidney failure.\nTreatment of Coronavirus Though there are potential therapeutics but there are no specific treatments for coronaviruses \u2013 just as there is no treatment for the common cold.\nPeter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health, at the Centre of Tropical Medicine and Global Health at the University of Oxford, said the disease bore all the signs of a \u201cclassic viral pneumonia\u201d.\n\u201cThere are currently no antivirals for this, so care is just supportive, supporting the lungs and other organs until patients recover,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere are other potential therapeutics out there but no effective antiviral,\u201d he added.",

        "content": "Like many organizations, the COVID-19 virus hit Cecil College hard \u2014 and forced a change in how the school was delivering its in-person instruction.\nLuckily, the school was prepared, and has used the shutdown caused by the virus to not only continue its instructional program, but also to generate new ideas for the future.\nThe college already had an online learning management system, according to Vice-President of Academic Programs Dr. Christy Dryer. This allowed the school to make the necessary transition to a completely distance learning concept at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and shutdown.\nOnline instruction\nThe school uses an online learning portal called Blackboard, common at many higher learning institutes. Dryer said the program provides a context for every course at the college, and that the software has been in place for several years.\nOne of the programs in Blackboard is Collaborate, which is a virtual classroom that professors and students can use to replicate an in-person classroom environment. Other programs include Respondus, an online test monitoring system and SoftChalk, which allows professors to create online lessons that have videos, gaming and quizzes embedded in the software.\nDryer said the school also already had an online writing lab, known as OWL.\n\u201cWe also put in place a professional development for online teaching course,\u201d Dryer said.\n\u201cIn order to teach online, you have to have experience online, some formal education in online teaching or they had to take the course.\u201d\nDryer said before COVID-19 struck, many faculty members took the online course.\n\u201cWe felt uniquely positioned with a lot of the pieces in place to meet this,\u201d Dryer said, adding that in addition to the many online programs and feature the college has at its disposal, many courses already had both online and in-person offerings and many degrees were awarded for online and in-person work.\n'Everything we needed was already there'\nAssociate Business Professor Adele Foltz said she felt very prepared to teach online in part due to the college\u2019s PDOT class, which she described as wonderful.\nShe said professors had ample time to prepare to move in-person courses to an all online format as a forewarning of the impending closure occurred before the college\u2019s spring break that ran from March 16-21. Foltz said that professors had the entire week of spring break to prepare for the change.\nFoltz said in making the transition from face-to-face instruction to online teaching, she began looking at the technology she had and what she would need to transfer her classes.\n\u201cEverything we needed was already there in the Blackboard software, I just had to implement it,\u201d she said.\nUsing the software\nFoltz gave the Whig an online demonstration and allowed this reporter to work through the Blackboard software as a student might. During the video presentation, Foltz was standing in front of a traditional whiteboard, and she outlined how she could teach a class using the whiteboard in a similar was to an in person class.\nShe also noted that the Blackboard Collaborate software as a whiteboard that can be shared with the student on the student\u2019s own computer. She noted that her students have found the whiteboard to be helpful in learning the material.\nFoltz also said the additional benefit of the software is that the lessons can be recorded, giving the students the opportunity to go back and watch the video if they either missed a portion of the lesson or might have been having an issue with some of the material presented.\n\u201cIt has been pretty well received by students,\u201d she said.\nFlexibility is key in online instruction\nOne of the most important aspects in the delivery of information online has been the ability to remain flexible, Foltz said.\nSome students, due to their family situations as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, have a harder time working and studying from home. Foltz said professors have had to be innovative to be able to continue to deliver the material in a way that works for all students.\n\u201cThese courses include the same objectives, same rigor and same experience through Collaborate that students receive in person,\u201d she said.\nThe online experience can also be tailored in many respects to mirror an in person experience, Foltz noted.\nFor instance, students can not only interact with the professor, they can even interact with each other during a class. During her presentation, Foltz pointed out that a student can even raise their hand by clicking an icon that looks like a person raising their hand, this sends a tone to Foltz that she can hear and then recognize the student who is answering the question. In this way, other students can hear questions being raised by their fellow students in much the same way an in person class might be conducted.\nOne interesting feature Foltz pointed out in the software is the ability to send polling questions or other questions to students as group during the class. She said that while the tool has been quite useful in online learning she intends to incorporate the concept when in person classes are able to resume. She said she felt that her student\u2019s access to her is 10 times better with the software than it might have been before, even with respect to in person classes because of all of the hands-on training she is able to do with the software.\nDigital access remains an issue\nThe only complaints Dryer said the school has heard from students is that some students have limited access or limited wifi capabilities.\nAlso, some students have had difficulties initially using the technology. Dryer said health care students' normal curriculum would have them working with patients, rather than doing simulations online.\nAs for the technical issues, the college has been working closely with students to resolve connectivity issues as well as helping students who have had problems learning to use the technology.\n\u201cI think overall what I am hearing from our students is they are pleasantly surprised and staying engaged,\u201d Dryer said.\nDryer said that while it is too early to know specifics relating to how the college might be able to use lessons learned during the COVID-19 shutdown for the future she did say that school officials are learning in a much more expeditious way than they might have otherwise how efficient the college can be in delivering its educational programs to its student. She said it helps expand what the college can do online going forward and helps to enhance all of the school\u2019s programs overall.\n\u201cOnce we get out of [the shutdown], there will be some programming that changes and some course delivery models that change permanently,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe will always have in-person classes no matter what, as everything doesn\u2019t translate to online learning. For instance, there is only so much virtual learning you can do in health care.\u201d\nDryer said through this process she has received some amazing emails from faculty members about creative things they are doing in their classes.\n\u201cI have worked at Cecil for a very long time and I have always been proud,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have ever been as proud as I am right now.\u201d\nCecil College President Mary Way Bolt provided a written statement on how the school has adjusted during this trying time.\n\u201cCecil College has always been, and will remain, united in our dedication to provide the quality education and resources necessary for our students to succeed,\u201d Bolt said.\n\u201cNow, more than ever, we have harnessed that spirit to swiftly respond to the COVID-19 crisis with the innovation and rapid problem solving paramount to ensuring that student learning is not interrupted and that each of our Seahawks feel 100 percent supported by us.\u201d ",

Later in the day, one family member started to feel sick and went to the hospital. They tested positive for the novel coronavirus.\nWithin two weeks, nine other people, including four more members of \"Family A,\" and five people from two other tables had also tested positive for COVID-19.\nIt's important to note that of the 83 customers at the restaurant on the same floor that same day, 73 of them did not get sick. The eight employees working on the same floor also didn't get sick.\nThe researchers concluded the members of \"Family A\" could have been infected outside of the restaurant by their relative who showed symptoms later in the day. But for the other five people at nearby tables, the restaurant appears to be where they were infected.\nThe researchers believe droplets from the first person to show symptoms in \"Family A\" were likely blown by the air conditioning unit toward \"Family B,\" then bounced off the wall, back in the direction of the third family. No one else besides individuals sitting in the path of the AC unit became sick.\nSketch showing arrangement of restaurant tables and air conditioning airflow at site of outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease, Guangzhou, China, 2020. Red circles indicate seating of future case-patients; yellow-filled red circle indicates index case-patient. CDC Since the coronavirus wasn't too widespread beyond Wuhan at the time of this incident, public health officials were able to track where individuals contacted it. The other 73 restaurant-goers were quarantined for 14 days and never developed symptoms, researchers explained.\n\"From our examination of the potential routes of transmission, we concluded that the most likely cause of this outbreak was droplet transmission,\" the researchers wrote. \"We conclude that in this outbreak, droplet transmission was prompted by air-conditioned ventilation. The key factor for infection was the direction of the airflow.\"",

Instead, individuals are being advised initially to consult their credit card or travel providers to get refunded for cancelled bookings, and for medical costs.For companies such as airlines that are now ripping up their China plans, there may be no recourse from their insurers, according to Clarissa Franks, risk management placement leader at insurance broker Marsh in London.\"The devil really is in the details because business interruption policies, contingency policies, can cover communicable diseases. However, policy language will quite often exclude this type of disease,\" she told AFP.It is too early to determine overall costs to the insurance industry from the deadly coronavirus spreading out of China, whose death toll has now surpassed that of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002-03.The reinsurance market at Lloyd's of London has not seen any untoward activity from traditional insurers looking to hedge their exposure to risks arising from this outbreak, two sources in the underwriting trade said.But even if they are not covered for communicable diseases specifically, companies will be checking the fine print as ripple effects flow through their China operations and global supply chains, following Beijing's decision to quarantine entire cities.\u2018Very close attention\u2019As with SARS and other pandemics of recent years such as swine flu, Zika and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the industry will be \"paying very close attention to this\", Association of British Insurers spokesman Malcolm Tarling said.He cautioned individuals and companies: \"If someone travels [to China] against government advice, then most policies will be invalidated. If you believe your trip is essential, you need to talk to your insurer first.\"The closest analogy is SARS, which first broke out in China in 2002 and led to a slew of disputes between companies and their insurance providers.For the travel industry alone, the impact of SARS was estimated by the World Travel and Tourism Council at US$30-50 billion.But China's economy accounted for 5% of global gross domestic product then, compared to nearly a fifth today, according to World Bank data.More Chinese now travel abroad than any other nationality, and they spend the most on average while away.\u2018Urgent alert\u2019Leading British insurer Aviva said customers need to have specific coverage for \"travel disruption\" as part of their policy to be sure of reimbursement for changes to their plans.\"We're monitoring the situation closely, but so far the overwhelming majority of claims relate to customers who are travelling to and from China,\" an Aviva spokeswoman said.Allianz of Germany said the first port of call for individuals suffering disruption should be their airline or travel agency, rather than their insurer.The company said the outbreak was \"clearly a very urgent alert\" but at this stage, normal terms and conditions of insurance contracts applied.For airlines and other companies in the firing line, communicable diseases will typically only be covered if they have taken out specialist coverage.But that would come at a cost that probably outweighs the risk-benefit return.\"Traditional insurance can't cover everything and non-traditional insurance will tend to carry a significant cost and require a thorough process to determine what an individual company needs,\" Franks at Marsh said.\"It will be a very bespoke product.\"",

On KVNU\u2019s For the People program on Tuesday, Keith Larsen, the Emergency Services director at Bear River Health Department, said there is not one Coronavirus case being treated in Utah.\n\u201cWe certainly want to take this very, very seriously but there is no risk to anybody in our Bear River health district right now. We\u2019ll take it seriously and we\u2019ll work hard on insuring that people are safe, but right now things are going well, \u201d Larsen said.\nHe said public health is all about prevention. For the respiratory diseases that are frequent this time of year, the prevention actions are all the same: avoid contact with sick persons (staying at least six feet away), avoid traveling while sick, cover your mouth and nose with your sleeve and not your hand when you cough or sneeze.\nAs far as influenza in the area, Larsen said the cases are as high as they\u2019ve been in six years and hospitalizations are being seen. He said he hopes people are getting the message about the importance of flu vaccines.\n\u201cI can tell you, back during the days of H1NI (virus) in 2009, in the three county area between our medical partners and ourselves, we vaccinated around 70,000 people.

But the interesting thing is we\u2019re running about 50/50 right now, actually 58/42 with Influenza B, that\u2019s the predominant strain that we\u2019re seeing at 58 percent and Influenza A at 42 percent .\u201d\nLarsen said the influenza viruses are their own type while the Coronavirus is more closely related to past outbreaks such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Virus.

This includes all those who may have come within a one metre distance of the patient,\" he said during a press conference at the ministry, here, today.\n\"Of the 18, three patients have fully recovered and were discharged. The rest are still being treated in isolation and have responded positively to the treatments administered. We are using a slightly different approach but the result is about the same in preventing any further spread,\" he said.\nDr Dzulkefly said confirmed cases and their close contacts, who are in isolation, were all reported to be in a stable condition.\n\"This included the 105 who were brought back through the evacuation mission from Wuhan as well as another 107 close contacts who are still in isolation. There are no new symptomatic cases among the evacuees except for the father and daughter that have been reported on the day of arrival,\u201d the minister added.\nOn the possibility of a relapse in victims who had fully recovered from the virus, Dr Dzulkefly said he did not rule out the possibility, however it was very unlikely.\n\"It is not impossible but highly unlikely because by the time a patient recovers and is discharged, the body's immune system has become stronger and able to fight off the viral attack,\u201d he said, adding there are no relapses involving the three fully recovered cases so far.\nThe minister then denied allegations of two Singaporeans getting the virus after their trip to Malaysia (Singapore case 31 and 33) saying that the health authorities in Singapore had managed to establish links of the two with visitors from China.\nDr Dzulkefly is scheduled to have a teleconference call with his Singaporean counterpart on matters related to the outbreak concerning both countries at 4pm tomorrow.",

You bl**dy racist fool!\"\nRead more: German coronavirus evacuee describes life in quarantine\nThat poor couple, out doing the weekly shop like me, must have felt so objectified and they may not have even been Chinese, or from Wuhan. Or again, like me, a half-Indian who's never been to India, they may have never visited the country of their parents or grandparents birth.\nCorkscrew of fear and loathing\nThe current case of coronavirus is a little complicated.\nTo start with we're dealing with a relatively unknown virus. Scientists don't know enough to understand how it spreads or develops, and as a result, how it can be stopped. And that sense of \"unknown unknowns,\" to misquote yet again, this time former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , is a natural breeding ground for fear, irrational feelings of distrust, disgust, hate, racism and xenophobia.\nThat U.N. report describes xenophobia as including behavior that rejects, excludes and vilifies people \"based on the perception \" that they are \"outsiders.\" Medically justified as they may be, national programs that remove and quarantine \"plane loads\" of people from Wuhan to Australia's Christmas Island or to military bases in the UK feeds into such perceptions.\nAs with the Biblical reference, Rumsfeld was not for nothing either. Rumsfeld and the George Bush Junior administration he served between 2001 and 2006 used that sense of unknown threats to leverage support for a Middle East war and an Islamophobia, encouraged with images of bearded Muslim bogeymen, which quickly transpired.\nAs far away from China as El Salvador: Thermographic imaging of air travellers\nBut then, when it comes to China, what extra leverage do people need?\nWe in the \"West\" already harbor feelings of distrust and xenophobia against the Chinese state and the people who live there \u2014 whether they're Chinese or not. We're perfectly happy to buy the iPhones they manufacture, but we sure as Hinnom don't want the Chinese firm Huawei anywhere near our 5G networks . They will spy on us, surely.\nAnd it's happened before\nThe trouble is, we often don't even realize we're doing it. Which is part of the same kind of complacency and idiocy inherent in racism itself. So, for instance, UC Berkley may have thought it was doing students a favor when the university's health center said that \"normal reactions\" to coronavirus included panic, anger, hyper-vigilance to health and \u2026 wait for it \u2026 xenophobia.\nBut is it really? Normal? I suppose if a lot of people feel that way, you could say it is kind of normal. But that doesn't make it right. UC Berkeley was accused of \"normalizing racism\" (as reported in the The Washington Post ) and apologized for the advice (my emphasis).\nOnly I would say a certain level of normalization is necessary. Without normalization, we can go on refusing to accept that racism or xenophobia, and the irrational psychological feelings that feed them, exist and need to be handled head-on.\nAfter all, we have been here before. In 2004, a year after the outbreak of SARS in Asia, researchers wrote about \" SARS-related fear, stigmatization, and discrimination .\" In an opinion piece for The New York Times , Iris Chang wrote about \" Fear of SARS, Fear of Strangers ,\" and led with a line about UC Berkeley (them again?) banning students from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore from all its summer programs.\nAnd those left behind in Wuhan ... Left to clean and rid the city of the virus\nAvoidance psychology\nBut these feelings of fear work like a corkscrew \u2014 they drill deep and risk fracturing any brittle constitution. These feelings can also endanger the perpetrators themselves.\nIn 2004, a paper about the \" psychology behind the masks \" referred to \"two diseases looming\" \u2014 one, the virus itself and two, that of a psychological nature. The authors write about \"panic-stricken people\" mobbing stores after a fake news article said Hong Kong would be sealed off from the world. Then, a man from Taiwan committed suicide in a hospital ward because he suspected family members had contracted the then-fatal virus. An evident, yet anecdotal, SARS-phobia was rearing its head. Now we have Corona-phobia.\nNone of this helps anyone. In fact, it's like the 1980s panic around HIV. The unthinking among us believed we could only get HIV if we were gay or bisexual. But as early as 1988 researchers knew that wasn't true . Watch video 01:07",

People with milder symptoms might mistake it for a bad cold/flu and be fine afterwards and never counted. Of course, this could go the other way, but I think that people going to doctor in the worst case is more likely than staying home. Risk of dying outside of China is less than 1%. I imagine a lot of the problem in China is/was the information shutdown, intense population density, and overwhelmed/unprepared health systems.I just feel like people overreact to a danger that isn't likely to affect them while ignoring more present, more pressing dangers.

        "content": "The Chinese woman diagnosed with Coronavirus in Sri Lanka is continuing to receive treatment at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Angoda. The Health Ministry said that the condition of the patient is not critical.\nThe Chinese woman aged 43 had been admitted to the IDH Hospital after developing high fever last Saturday (Jan 25). A blood test carried out on the patient showed that she had contracted Corona virus.\nQuestion: How is the situation of the patient admitted at the IDH Hospital?\nDr. Anil Jayasinghe: I inquired about the patient. As of now, she is not in a critical condition.\nQuestion: Is she showing positive signs of recovery?\nDr.AnilJayasinghe: We can say that the situation is positive and that she is being treated carefully. We have given antibiotics and taken other relevant steps. I made inquiries this morning. She is in good condition.\nThe SARS virus which belongs to the category of the Coronavirus affected 26 countries in 2003 while claiming around 700 lives. Professor Malik Peiris attached to the Microbiology Department of the Hong Kong University who introduced a treatment for the virus said that the Coronavirus is less severe when compared to the SARS virus.\nHe noted;\n\u201cThere is no tested medicine to cure the virus since it is new. However, there are other things which we can do. We can treat the respiratory disorders caused by the virus. The patients can be treated by paying medical attention and care although there is no definite medicine. Testings are underway to identify a drug that can curb the virus. However, this cannot be done within a short time. It will take months or years to introduce this medicine. Although this virus is less severe than the SARS virus it is dangerous than the H1N1 influenza virus. Several teams including us are in the process of inventing devices that can detect the disease. We are paying attention to other factors as well. This includes the manner in which the virus spreads. We are carrying out tests to introduce a medicine that can be used to cure this disease.\u201d\nThe Professor also expressed his views on the steps which need to be taken in order to curb the spread of the virus.\n\u201cDoctors should study the medical history of a patient showing symptoms of respiratory illnesses or pneumonia. If that patient has been in China for 14 days it could be suspected that the patient has contracted Coronavirus. Tests can be carried out on such patients afterward. Wearing a face mask will serve its purpose only if it is worn in an appropriate manner. There is no point in wearing several masks if they are worn in the wrong manner. A person must know how to wear, remove and store a mask. If the proper measures are not taken in this regard the situation could worsen. There is no need to spread panic as there is only one reported case in Sri Lanka. However, it is important to be vigilant.\u201d\nMeanwhile, it has been made compulsory for all passengers arriving in the island to complete the information form provided to them on arrival. Director-General of Health Services, Dr.Anil Jasinghe said, the itinerary of the visitors including their travel schedule, time frame and intended destinations of travel as well as lodging would be recorded.\nMinister of Health Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi speaking regarding the epidemic noted that all Sri Lankan students who arrive in the country from the Chinese province of Wuhan will be moved to separate rooms in the Diyathalawa Camp. She added that they cannot provide accommodation at hospitals or hotels for all of them as they do not have the ability to build a hospital in 6 days. The Minister said that any person travelling from China to Sri Lanka must apply for a visa via the online portal and that they have instructed the Immigration and Emigration Department in this regard.\nDirector-General of Health Services Dr Anil Jasinghe noted;\n\u201cAt the Palaly Airport, passengers are tested by medical staff individually due to the low volume of passengers arriving at the airport. We already have a very strict process in place for those who arrive in the island on board ships. Instructions have been given to ensure all those on board will not leave the ship until a team of medical specialists enters the ship. The Ministry of Health added 11 more hospitals to facilitate the observation and treatment of suspected cases of the Corona virus. In addition to the Infectious Diseases Hospital, the Colombo North Hospital, Negombo Hospital, Gampaha Hospital, Kandy General Hospital, Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital, Jaffna Teaching Hospital, Kurunegala Teaching Hospital, Ratnapura Provincial Hospital, Batticaloa Teaching Hospital, and the Badulla Provincial Hospital have been prepared to facilitate observation and treatment of suspected cases of the coronavirus. Any suspected case of the virus can visit the closest hospital and they will be treated in isolation. Though this virus is rapidly spreading, however, its virulence is not that high, which is somewhat a relief. We have provided all medical teams with personal protective equipment. A part of this was received from the World Health Organization, while the remaining were purchased externally. We have issued a gazette in this regard to all regional health inspectors.\u201d Visa restrictions\nVisitors were temporarily restricted from entering the Bandaranaike International Airport from 6 am as a preventive measure against the spread of Coronavirus. Passengers arriving from China are being allowed to enter the country only through a special terminal.\nMore than 150 Sri Lankan students in China returned to the country last night and this morning. Twenty one Sri Lankan students returned from Tianjin at around 7:30 pm while the other students had arrived this morning on three chartered SriLankan airline flights.\nThe students had been based in the Chinese cities of Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shanghai.\nState Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena noted that the President has been commended immensely as the current government managed to repatriate the students at the earliest only next to the US. He added that arrangements have been made to bring down 860 students with a 50 per cent discount on airfares. He said that, at the same time, students based in cities that have barred entry for outsiders have been removed from those areas.\nMeanwhile, the Department of Immigration and Emigration has decided to ban Chinese tourists from the Chinese cities of Wuhan, Huanggang, and Ezhou following the recent outbreak of the virus. This decision will be in effect from today.\nThe Immigration Department said that the applications of those applying for visas from 53 Chinese states in which at least five Coronavirus patients have been reported, will not be accepted, unless due to unavoidable circumstances.\nThis move follows the decision to suspend the issuance of on-arrival visas for Chinese tourists with effect from today. However, he noted that the permitted tourists will have to undergo a scanning process through a Red Channel at the Bandaranaike International Airport.\nAccording to the revised regulations, Chinese citizens will have to apply for online visas before boarding their flights to Sri Lanka and these applications would be reviewed by the Department of Immigration and Emigration. Face Mask Issue\nFollowing the first confirmed case of Coronavirus in Sri Lanka, a shortage of face-masks has arisen in the country, especially in urban areas. It is widely reported, a face mask is currently being sold at a price between 500 to 1000 rupees in Colombo and other key cities.\nMany pharmacies have run out of stock and Government-run Osu Sala has limited the output of face masks as well. The National Medicine Regulatory Authority said steps were taken to import stocks immediately adding local producers were instructed to increase production as well.\nAn officer at the Ministry of Health noted that they held discussions with three, face mask manufacturing companies today. The officer said they requested them to increase production as much as possible, however, raw materials to manufacture the face masks are also imported from China, which might be an issue.\nThe General Secretary of the GMOA Dr Haritha Aluthge said that there is some sort of a mafia taking place with regard to certain medical equipment in the market. He said at present face masks are not available anywhere. He added that the general public has not been advised to wear face masks, and therefore, no one needs to worry about this situation. Opposition Leader\u2019s Statement\nOpposition Leader Sajith Premadasa in a statement has called on Parliament to convene immediately to discuss matters on the coronavirus, considering it as a very serious issue. Highlighting the fact, all must unite to protect the country irrespective of their party affiliations, Sajith Premadasa made 06 proposals to the House of Legislature. Enforce a 24-hour security system and boost health security. Ensure the return of Sri Lankans in China through state intervention and not depend on monetary regulations. Carry out extensive tests on those individuals The state should take action to identify the current health status of Chinese nationals residing in this country. Patient status and prevention of infection should be relayed to the public. In the event of an emergency, to convene Parliament\nHe emphasized the Opposition is ready to take up responsibility and necessary intervention in this situation. Mayor of Wuhan city resigns\nAs an apology due to the rapid spread of Coronavirus in the city of Wuhan in China, Chu Shiang Wan has decided to resign from his duties as the Mayor of Wuhan city. He stated that the lockdown in effect for 10 million citizens has never occurred in the history of the country.\nMeanwhile, more than 106 people have died due to the rapid spread of the virus while the number of infected people has surpassed 4500. Last night, residents of Wuhan city were seen singing songs and stated that they would not abandon the city regardless of the virus.\nThis is the first time that the residents have left their homes and gathered in the streets in such a manner since the spread of the virus. The first person to die from the virus was reported from Beijing city yesterday.\nTaking into consideration the current situation, authorities have decided to keep all universities and schools shut down in lieu of the Chinese new year. Foreign media reported that the current travel bans have been further strengthened whilst its been made compulsory that certain cities have to use a face mask\nForeign media further states that most people who have passed away due to the illness are older people or those who have respiratory difficulties. Meanwhile, 18 Coronavirus patients have been reported from Hong Kong, Thailand, Australia, and Japan. Latest News",

He said already, an initial alert was sent to the hospital and district staff on January 10th prior to the human-to human transmission of occurrence. \u201cSo, it gives you an idea that the Ministry of Health has been on top of this game for a while now\u2026\u201d, he said. There is also ongoing training to provide updated and standard case definitions to all relevant stakeholders. Also, in place is the development and dissemination of reporting tools to healthcare providers during the preparation phase, including the development of a database. Dr. McIntyre said further that active surveillance will be conducted at the health facilities and at various points of entry. \u201cAll district medical officers are alerted of the situation, secondly ambulance and immigration officers will be alerted through the International Health Regulation Steering Committee. A meeting is also scheduled for January 30 th where health officials will discuss the implementation of routine measures, such as placement of trained staff at the various ports of entry. He further explained that before anyone is to arrive at Dominica\u2019s ports of entry, \u201cthrough technology we actually know where they are coming from.\u201d \u201cIf they are coming from China, we have that in advance, so we can actually be waiting for these people and if any symptoms we take the necessary actions,\u201d he said. In terms of case Management which forms part of the Health Ministry\u2019s plan, Dr. McIntyre indicated that there will be retraining of healthcare staff on severe acute respiratory illness, case management. \u201cSelected nurses and Doctors\u2026a review of Intensive Care Unit capacity to facilitate the isolation of persons if need be\u2026\u201d he added. He said the fourth aspect of the Health Ministry\u2019s plan is the sample submissions. \u201cSpecimens to be collected from symptomatic patients,\u201d he revealed. Dr. McIntrye said the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the Caribbean Public Health Agency CARPHA will be assisting the Ministry of Health to getting such samples to the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta, \u201csince in the Caribbean we do not have the capability of getting laboratory tests done for this coronavirus\u201d Additionally, arrangements have been made with both CARPHA and PAHO to assist us in getting samples to the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta. He said the fifth aspect of the Ministry of Health plan is infection control. \u201cApplications of standard precautions for all patients, that is hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment according to risk assessment, both N95 and surgical masks can be utilized,\u201d he stated. The six aspect of the Ministry of Health\u2019s plan is risk communication and health promotional interventions. Dr. McIntyre explained that the goal of risk communication is to ensure a timely and efficient flow of accurate and consistent information during all phases of emergency or risk. At least 132 people are dead and more than 6,000 cases have been confirmed in mainland China, as the Wuhan coronavirus spreads across Asia and the rest of the world. Imported cases have been reported by other countries including Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea and the United States of America (Washington). The symptoms maybe that of the flu and include runny nose, cough, sore throat and fever. Some cases develop into a pneumonia of severe acute respiratory infections. At this time, it\u2019s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people.\nCopyright 2012 Dominica News Online, DURAVISION INC. All Rights Reserved.

The drones are couriering medical samples between the emergency centre and the hospital. on February 6, a medical delivery drone, by Antwork, flying from the people's Hospital of Xinchang County to the disease control centre of Xinchang County successfully completed its air transportation, marking the launch of the first urban air transportation channel to help to fight the corona virus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in China. Xinchang County is located in Zhejiang province, and Zhejiang province is one of the most severely virus hit provinces with already 1006 patients confirmed 2019-nCoV diagnoses.At present, Xinchang County is in a tense period of national epidemic prevention and control. In order to respond to the needs of epidemic prevention and control, Antwork actively contacts with local hospitals, and supports epidemic prevention with practical actions, fully cooperates with local governments and medical related units, and escorts the timely and rapid delivery of medical samples and protection materials through the deployment of it's drone transportation network.During the epidemic prevention and control period, Antwork took the initiative to take drone RA3 and tr7s as well as unmanned station RH1 as the technical solution, to transport medical samples and quarantine materials between Xinchang County People's Hospital, Xinchang County disease control centre and Dashiju branch of Xinchang County People's hospital. In this operation, the air delivery system provided by Antwork was adopted. Its automatic and unmanned operation mode can significantly reduce the contact opportunities between samples and personnel in the transportation process, and improve delivery speed. At the same time, the Antwork branch company (Aerodeli), which undertakes this operation task, has obtained the world's first urban drone delivery license issued by Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) last October. The sample delivery work will be carried out in strict accordance with the certified operation procedures, which can ensure the safety of medical samples in the transportation process.\nTake off and landing point of disease control centre of Xinchang County In the actual transportation process, the flight efficiency of drone has increased by more than 50% compared with the ordinary road transportation, which provides an efficient means of transportation for the epidemic prevention and control. At the same time, with more and more medical staff and ambulances being transferred to the front line, in the case of extreme personnel shortage, the use of drone transportation can also save human resources to the greatest extent. In addition, using drone to transport materials can effectively avoid secondary pollution of medical materials.As soon as the news of Wuhan blocking came out on January 23, Antwork immediately contacted the health and disease control departments of various regions, and took the initiative to petition for the technical support of drone air transportation for the front-line medical institutions fighting against the epidemic. After the project of Xinchang people's hospital is put into operation, Antwork will also actively assist more medical institutions around the nation to deploy air transport services and contribute a technical force to the anti-epidemic!",

It means that, instead of it being called simply a disease, it is now having an attachment to that of being uniquely Chinese. Interestingly, in an attempt to deflect this reference, the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, recently alluded to the disease as being that which has been imported to China by wild animal traffickers. This reference is obviously meant for the traffickers of animals and their parts from Africa. In other words, the disease comes from Africa as the animals are from its wildlife. This is not correct and proper. It is generally known that the disease originated from the fish markets in Hubei Province, where the capital Wuhan is. So, the disease is most likely one which Chinese fishermen and fish sellers have got from the fish in the Pacific Ocean and the Yellow Sea. This cannot be from Africa. The World Health Organization should concentrate on getting governments to stop its spread; and especially sponsor the funding of respirators instead of face masks. The latter have been suspected as being not very effective as to stopping the coughing and sneezing. ",

It is believed that they contracted the virus from people in their households or neighborhoods, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\"Animals, pets, can get infected. ... There's no evidence that the virus is transmitted from the pet to a human,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at the daily coronavirus briefing.\nThere are few known Covid-19 infections of pets globally. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, one cat in Hong Kong tested positive without displaying symptoms, while a cat in Belgium recovered nine days after falling ill.\nFive tigers and three lions at the Bronx Zoo in New York have also tested positive for Covid-19, including one tiger who never developed a cough, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society, the non-profit which runs the zoo.\n\"Our cats were infected by a staff person who was asymptomatically infected with the virus or before that person developed symptoms,\" the WCS said on Wednesday. \"All eight cats continue to do well. They are behaving normally, eating well, and their coughing is greatly reduced.\"\nNone of the zoo's leopards, cheetahs, puma or serval are showing any signs of illness, it added.\nNew York City is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, which like much of the world is taking extraordinary measures to prevent the spread, but authorities indicated owners did not need to fear their pets.\n\"There is no evidence that pets play a role in spreading the virus in the United States,\" the CDC said in a statement. \"Therefore, there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals that may compromise their welfare. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including pets, could be affected.\"\nThe agency recommends that owners not let their pets interact with people or other animals outside the household. Cats should be kept indoors and dogs should be walked on a leash, maintaining at least six feet (1.8 meters) from other animals and people, it said.\nThe CDC said coronavirus infections have been reported in very few animals worldwide, mostly in those that had close contact with a person with Covid-19. It is not recommending routine testing of animals at this juncture.\nThe AVMA similarly said it was not changing its basic guidance for pet owners and veterinarians, adding that any test of an animal should be performed in coordination with public health officials.\nMaine-based animal health company IDEXX Laboratories Inc on Monday rolled out a Covid-19 test for pets, which it said would be available to veterinarians in North America this week and distributed internationally after that.\nIDEXX said it has conducted over 5 000 tests in cats, dogs, and horses with respiratory symptoms in 17 countries and has found no positive results, suggesting pets \"generally remain uninfected, except in rare and isolated cases.\"\nThe company developed its test specifically for use in animals and its laboratories are not approved for handling human specimens, it said.\nEarlier this month a study suggested that cats can become infected with the new coronavirus but dogs appear not to be vulnerable, prompting the World Health Organization to say it will take a closer look at transmission of the virus between humans and pets.\nA recent study published on the website of the journal Science found that cats and ferrets can become infected with SARS-CoV-2, the scientific term for the virus that causes the Covid-19 disease in humans.\nThe study, based on research conducted in China in January and February, found, however, that dogs, chickens, pigs and ducks are not likely to catch the virus.\nThe United States has the world's largest number of coronavirus cases at over 830 000, with 47 050 deaths as of Wednesday.",

        "content": "Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIR), a clinical-stage immunology company focused on immune approaches to treating and preventing serious infectious diseases, today announced that it has identified two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d), which were originally found because they bind and neutralize the original SARS-CoV. The antibodies target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the region that the virus uses to enter cells through the cellular receptor ACE2. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes the newly named disease, Covid-19.\n\u201cWe are in the process of assessing neutralization with a pseudo-virus,\u201d said George Scangos, Ph.D., CEO of Vir. \u201cIn addition, we are working with international partners to assess the capacity of these antibodies to neutralize the live virus, SARS-CoV-2.\u201d\nThe company is moving ahead with research to determine if its antibodies, or additional antibodies that it may be able to identify, can be effective as treatment and/or prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. To that end, the company is exploring collaborations with a number of other companies and governmental agencies. Amongst these are specific efforts at accessing manufacturing capacity globally.\n\u201cWe are pleased that, using the same platform that was used to isolate mAb114 which has proven to be active against Ebola, we have quickly identified antibodies with potential biological activity against SARS-CoV-2,\u201d said Herbert \u201cSkip\u201d Virgin, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer, Vir. \u201cWe are working as rapidly as possible and look forward to sharing more information as we have it.\u201d\nVir identified these antibodies from an existing library of 20 fully human antibodies that bind and neutralize related coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and coronaviruses that infect animals. This library was built through a robust method for capitalizing on unusually successful immune responses naturally occurring in people who are protected from, or have recovered from, infectious diseases, including those caused by rapidly evolving and/or previously untreatable pathogens.\nAntibody-based therapies are different from vaccines and have distinct attributes that may make them potentially valuable, particularly in pandemic settings:\nAntibodies can be therapeutic and prophylactic, meaning they can be used as a treatment for people who have been infected and can also protect people who have been, or may be, exposed to infection. Whereas a vaccine requires an individual to make an immune response, which can take weeks and be insufficient, an antibody provides the immune response, which can be effective within hours of injection and is not dependent upon the individual making an immune response to the pathogen. Antibodies can be engineered to have an extended half-life of several months or more. Vir is investigating other approaches to identify additional potential therapies for SARS-CoV-2. In addition to testing these two antibodies, the company is also exploring the isolation of new antibodies specific for this virus using its antibody technology platform. These efforts may allow additional approaches to address this rapidly emerging public health epidemic.\nAbout Vir\u2019s Antibody Platform\nVir has a robust method for capitalizing on unusually successful immune responses naturally occurring in people who are protected from, or have recovered from, infectious diseases. The platform is used to identify rare antibodies from survivors that have the potential to treat and prevent rapidly evolving and/or previously untreatable pathogens via direct pathogen neutralization and immune system stimulation. Vir engineers the fully human antibodies that it discovers to enhance their therapeutic potential. This platform has been used to identify and develop antibodies for pathogens including Ebola (mAb114, currently in use in the Democratic Republic of Congo), hepatitis B virus, influenza A, malaria, and others.\nAbout Vir Biotechnology\nVir Biotechnology is a clinical-stage immunology company focused on combining immunologic insights with cutting-edge technologies to treat and prevent serious infectious diseases. Vir has assembled four technology platforms that are designed to stimulate and enhance the immune system by exploiting critical observations of natural immune processes. Its current development pipeline consists of five product candidates targeting hepatitis B virus, influenza A, human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculosis.

Taiwan has listed the mysterious Wuhan virus as an emerging communicable disease. All CMAAO countries should do the same. NMAs should write to the government for the same. Hospitals and other medical institutions should be made to report suspected cases within 24 hours of diagnosis and compulsory quarantine of people with symptoms. Suspected cases are defined as people who develop a fever, pneumonia or other respiratory infections within 14 days of a visit to Wuhan. Emerging communicable disease means a disease with a substantial impact on the health of the population through its transmission. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing issued an alert to Americans in China last week, conveying guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), warning anyone who travels to Wuhan to avoid contact with all animals and sick people, and wash their hands regularly. The same should be done by other CMAAO countries.\nCoronavirus Advisory\nCoronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.\nCoronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.\nCommon signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.\nStandard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness, such as coughing and sneezing.",

Rarely, animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people and then spread between people such as has been seen with MERS and SARS. The outbreak in Wuhan, China, has been reported to be linked to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting a possible zoonotic origin of the outbreak. Liferiver Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech Co., Ltd., quickly developed a fluorescent PCR kit for the new coronavirus (cat. #: RR-0478-02). The newly developed kit uses multiple fluorescent PCR technology, single tube double detection, and simultaneous determination of two independent genes of the new coronavirus to eliminate the risk of missing detection due to virus variation. At the same time, the non-specific interference of SARS2003 and BatSARS-like virus strains can be eliminated, and 2019-nCoV virus can be precisely targeted. The development of the new kit is a supplement to Liferiver Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech's existing nucleic acid detection kits product categories, all of which available through MoBiTec, GmbH, Germany.

Carlos Garcia Rawlins, Reuters BEIJING - China has enacted extraordinary measures to contain the spread of a new coronavirus that has killed more than 130 people, infected thousands and reached some 15 countries.\nHere is a rundown of the steps taken so far in an unprecedented effort:\nMILLIONS UNDER LOCKDOWN\nMore than 56 million people are subject to travel curbs in Hubei province, where the virus was first detected.\nPublic transport has been stopped in 18 cities there, with train stations shut, events cancelled and theaters, libraries and karaoke bars closed in some locations.\nThe epicenter of the outbreak is provincial capital Wuhan, the biggest city on lockdown, where the government has halted all travel out of the Yangtze River metropolis of 11 million.\nReuters Wuhan residents have been urged to stay home and authorities have restricted car traffic in the city center.\nSimilar quarantine measures are being taken in nearby cities, with strict controls on weddings and funerals, temperature screenings for new arrivals, and the suspension of online taxi services.\nThe US and Japan airlifted out some of their trapped nationals on Wednesday. Europeans plan a similar operation this week.\nTRAVEL RESTRICTIONS\nBeijing, Shanghai and other megacities have suspended the entry and departure of long-distance bus services.\nAt least 2,000 inter-province train services have been cancelled since Friday -- most until February 8-9 but some for weeks.\nChinese authorities have also asked citizens to delay international travel to stop the virus from spreading elsewhere overseas.\nAuthorities had already suspended both domestic and overseas Chinese group tours over the weekend.\nTourists from Hubei in Haikou, capital of the island province of Hainan, were told by the city government they had to spend 14 days in a hotel for centralised medical observation, and were forbidden to leave.\nHOLIDAYS EXTENDED\nHundreds of millions of people criss-crossed the country last week for family reunions for the Lunar New Year holiday, in what is typically a joyous time of gatherings and public celebration.\nInstead, public health officials asked China's 1.4 billion citizens to confine themselves at home until all is clear.\nSchools and universities across the country were ordered not to reopen until further notice on Tuesday, a day after the holiday break was extended to try and reduce the spread of the virus.\nWuhan and Beijing had earlier cancelled public events that usually attract hundreds of thousands of people to temples during the New Year holiday.\nPeople wearing protective masks stand outside the main entrance of the Forbidden City where a notice is seen saying that the place is closed to visitors for the safety concern following the outbreak of a new coronavirus, in Beijing, China January 25, 2020. Carlos Garcia Rawlins, Reuters ATTRACTIONS CLOSED\nBeijing's Forbidden City, a sprawling imperial palace, was closed from Saturday.\nOther famous landmarks including a section of the Great Wall, the Ming Tombs and Yinshan Pagoda also shut. Tibet's Potala Palace was shut down on Monday.\nDisneyland theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong have closed down indefinitely.\nWomen's Olympics football qualifiers scheduled for next week in Wuhan have been moved out of the country and will now be held in Sydney.\nChina's film box-office earnings for Lunar New Year's Eve on Friday were just one-tenth of last year as people shunned crowds.\nUS coffee chain Starbucks said it had shut all its stores in Hubei during the holiday break and more than half of its stores around the country.\nA medical official takes the body temperature of a man at the departure hall of the airport in Changsha, Hunan Province, as the country is hit by an outbreak of a new coronavirus, China, January 27, 2020. Thomas Peter, Reuters TRAVEL SCREENING\nChina has ordered sterilization and ventilation at airports and bus stations, as well as inside planes and trains, while travelers are being screened for fever.\nTemperature screening checkpoints have been set up in hundreds of Chinese railway stations, according to state news agency Xinhua.\nAuthorities have asked people to wash their hands regularly, avoid crowded places, get plenty of fresh air and wear protective face masks.\nCity authorities in Wuhan have gone further and made it mandatory to wear masks in public places. A similar order was issued in southern Guangdong province, which has 110 million people.\nWith people rushing to get masks at pharmacies and on popular websites, China's industry and information technology ministry vowed to increase supply.\nTWO NEW HOSPITALS\nAuthorities in Wuhan are rushing to build two field hospitals by next week to ease pressure on medical facilities in the city that are struggling to handle a growing caseload.\nThe first facility is expected to be operational by next Monday and will have a capacity of 1,000 beds spread over 25,000 square meters, according to state media. The second is slated to open two days later with 1,300 beds.\nThe two new hospitals will be similar in size to the temporary facility built to tackle SARS in Beijing in 2003, when 650 people died from the disease in the mainland and Hong Kong.\n",

        "content": "When the United States 2009 H1N1 swine flu emerged, an international emergency, a declared global pandemic, it eventually infected 60 million and initially killed a minimum of 18,449 cases that year. But the final story of the H1N1 global pandemic was far worse than that, with close to 300,000 deaths, according to the final tallies in 2012 reported by the CDC, as you will read below.\nWhich is why I am scratching my head at how bizarrely negative forces are attacking China and Chinese people as it engages a remarkably aggressive front addressing this Corona virus outbreak which started in Wuhan, central China. I am forced to ask and answer a few questions.\nDuring 2009 H1N1 outbreak, I don't recall xenophobic anti-America attacks across the globe, do you? In fact, do you recall it took six months for the U.S. to declare a national emergency? Did any government from the onset in April 2009 through the end in April 2010, including the month of June, when H1N1 was declared an international emergency global pandemic, then send out a notice to its citizens that they should leave the United States? Close their borders to American travelers? Nope, not a peep.\nLike I said, something's not right, folks. I am reading hateful vicious attacks on the Chinese government for their supposed intentional conspiracy to intentionally under report the number of infections, yet that is exactly and always the case with such flu outbreaks no matter what country and the CDC reports illustrate that crystal clear. The U.S. H1N1 swine flu numbers were vastly underestimated and updated three years later, because dear friends, that is the nature of such viral outbreaks which don't care which country they started in. There is never enough man power, there are never enough test kits, there is never enough medicine or medical supplies. China is not trying to hide these hardships, they are well known, they are being reported on the news daily in China. There are always people who die, thousands of them whom we'll never know if they actually died because of a particular virus. Those are the facts, not any problem unique to China's healthcare system or government.\nIts not a conspiracy, its just tragedy.\nAccording to the June 27, 2012 research report followup three years later, it gets much more disturbing when you learn about the CDC's final estimate of the H1N1 virus global death toll. You and I find at this at this article at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy website, the CDC's 18,449 total deaths number was \"...regarded as WELL BELOW THE TRUE TOTAL, mainly because many people who die of flu-related causes are not tested for the disease.\" So during the 2009 outbreak, was anyone accusing the American medical and government authorities of hiding the numbers? Were Americans with hidden cameras strolling into the Mayo Clinic to PROVE how many people were really dying? The absurdity of these vicious attacks are that whether or not a person specifically does have the Corona virus or some other viral bug presenting as pneumonia, the treatment is the same supportive treatment anyway.\nSomething's not right here folks. The world should be applauding China's unprecedented, broad, aggressive response. (WHO officials and many other government and healthcare officials across the globe are.) I am on the ground here in China READ IT HERE watching with my own eyes and it is quite incredible by any measure, not to mention an enormous economic sacrifice.\nInstead of looking at the will of an entire system of government acting faster than any other government on the planet could, we are one month later, still busy bashing a few local government officials in Wuhan who should have told us a couple weeks sooner. And yes, that is true those local officials screwed up. And by the way, those officials are in deep trouble for it. Just like the recent Puerto Rican politicians who are in trouble when we learned they didn't distribute hurricane emergency supplies that were sent to them to help during last year's terrible hurricane. A disgrace. Individual people screw up all the time and hopefully justice gets served later, but that's not an indictment of an entire country's government. Secondly, on this point, every provincial government has sent out a notice to its government officials pretty much saying that if they are stupid enough to do the same, they will face the wrath of harsh punishment. I don't doubt it for a moment. Lets contrast to what countless western politicians have gotten away with and remain in office to remind all of us that human error, stupidity and greed is not unique to any particular skin color or race or country. \"What about...\" reactions don't help.\nAnd here's the mic drop for you: \"The CDC researchers estimate that the H1N1 2009 pandemic virus caused 201,200 respiratory deaths and another 83,300 deaths from cardiovascular disease associated with H1N1 infections.\" Total: 284,000 deaths. Shocking, isn't it?\nWas there a travel ban for any length of time to and from the United States?\nDid China, Germany, Japan or any other country close their border to American travelers?\nToday I noticed in the updates that following the United States Department of State policy suggesting U.S. citizens leave China, the United Kingdom embassy just released the same recommendation to subjects of the kingdom.\nIn 2009, did UK subjects in America get a notice from their kingdom to leave America? No.\nDid the world suggest we isolate from America? Close the U.S. borders!? No.\nDid Americans get xenophobically attacked and targeted by anti-American sentiments like the Chinese are experiencing now? Um, no.\nFascinating and disturbing to say the least. If you're an expat currently in China, unless you're in Wuhan, fact is that you're most likely safer and more peaceful and more stable by simply staying put than by leaving right now. You couldn't be safer than in this country, where almost everyone is staying home and dutifully isolating themselves with awareness. Not to mention that the Chinese government's decision to safeguard the society, the families, the people, is coming at a devastating economic cost in the hundreds of billions.\nI have a friend in Mesa, Arizona. He told me earlier that the big popular China City buffet, a huge busy place, has no customers. Does that make any sense at all?\nLet's test our ability to reason, to be rational:\nIf you were in Miami and you heard that there was a virus outbreak that started in Milan, in central Italy, would you cancel your dinner reservation at the Italian restaurant that night in South Beach? No. Would you buy a pizza next week at Joey's Pizzeria in Delray Beach?\nIf you were in Singapore and you heard there was a virus outbreak in Dallas, Texas in the central United States, would you stop going to your favorite local Texas southern BBQ restaurant with the owner from Houston, in Singapore?\nWould you avoid olive-skinned dark-haired Italian-looking people on the street in Chicago? Would you avoid big guys wearing cowboy hats, cuz they're obviously from Texas in Singapore cuz there's a virus in Dallas and they might have just gotten off the plane? There's a strange senseless bullying extremism and activism in today's society and you should do your best to avoid it and not be a part of it. It is fomented by a small group of extremist activists while definitely not supported by your average mainstream person who is simply exhausted by their outrage-inducing antics.\nFinally, here are some straight up, sensible accurate descriptions of this Corona virus which started in Wuhan, China. Its not called the China virus and neither was H1N1 called the America virus. Whether two weeks or two months from now, this flu season type virus will have passed and the joy of Spring will have arrived. Just like every flu season. However, don't misunderstand me. The extra caution and the remarkable response by the Chinese governments and people together to quell the spread of this virus was warranted because, yes it is correct that this corona virus is nastier than the usual annual flu bug, as was H1N1 in 2009. As of now, what we can confidently note the following regarding this Corona virus:\nThis Corona virus is highly contagious, it spreads quite easily. It binds to lung tissue and so in particular, likes to cause pneumonia, that's what infection of lung tissue is. That's more severe than a respiratory infection which is only in your throat or bronchial tubes.\nThe Corona virus currently has a 2% death rate. That's a lot higher, around 20x higher, than a more typical annual flu virus with a death rate of 0.1%. However, a 2% death rate is still much lower by comparison to the SARS virus which had a 9% death rate or the MERS virus with a really nasty 37% death rate.\nThe Corona virus is causing severe symptoms in 10-15% of cases. 80% to 90% of deaths from this virus are happening in elderly patients, mostly with other existing health problems, not younger people. That characteristic by the way, is in contrast to the America 2009 H1N1 swine flu virus which in fact had a higher death rate amongst younger people including children rather than those over 60 years old.\nChina identified and shared the Corona virus genome in record times, in only days and of course, immediately shared it with all international health and disease organizations. Medical researchers are already discovering that certain existing anti-viral medications seem to be effective against this Corona virus.\nIts impossible not to marvel at China's broad and aggressive domestic response directed by the provincial level governments to restrict movement, restrict transportation, restrict business for a period of time combined with the voluntary dutiful cooperation of its 1.3 billion citizens who are in the majority quietly staying at home these weeks to let the virus pass; this model response is already being hailed by the international community as a remarkable unprecedented response setting a new standard in understanding what is possible for future outbreaks in whatever country they may occur. Is it inconvenient and costly. You bet.\nLike I said, something's not right with the way humanity is responding to what's happening here. I haven't put my finger on it because well, its certainly complex and the world is upside down in many other ways that I also can't for the life of me understand or explain without ending up writing a very thick book.\nBut I do know this: It needs to stop. This vicious, political, xenophobic racist attacks and smearing of all things China needs to stop. Its really not helping anyone in the political corridors of Washington nor is it doing anything to help the man on the street who is just concerned with taking care of his family.\nMy family is originally from the Basilicata region of Italy, the little hillside Italian towns of Potenza and also, Grottola, which is just outside of Matera. They left their home country and moved to America where I was born, in Yonkers, New York. America became their home and it was my home until I left, too. Now over two decades ago, I left the United States, the country I was born in, the country that has plenty to admire and plenty to improve. But I left and I came to China and now China is my home. If you had asked me thirty years ago if this was my life plan on planet earth, I would have said you were nuts or a really bad fortune teller. But that's how it has turned out. I am truly blessed with my lovely Chinese wife and our family living here in Shenyang in China's northeast. You get my meaning? I am a mature adult like many with the powers of observation. I can easily see that whether we are talking about China or the United States or any other country, their societies and their governments have good points and bad points.\nThe xenophobia needs to stop now. Whether in a couple of weeks or months later, this nasty flu type Corona virus will begin declining and the joy of Spring will arrive. Between now and then if you don't have anything good, anything supportive to say about China or Chinese people, how about you just keep your mouth shut.\nMario takes the time to compare the situations between America's 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak and the current China Corona virus outbreak. Shrewd observations and hard questions reveal some truly disturbing differences. Also includes a clear sensible, accurate description of the Corona virus' characteristics. \n\nUS immoral to attack China's fight against virus The pandemic will finally pass. Many people badmouthed China during SARS 17 years ago, but what happened after? Nobody should underestimate China's ability to fight a public health crisis Keep faith in science to combat epidemic The disaster has actually proven China's astonishing mobilization ability and solidarity. Probably no country in the world will protect people's lives at any cost as China does. The epidemic won't weaken China's competitiveness. China will eventually win and become more mature and stronger Women shine in China's anti-epidemic campaign In China's battle against the novel coronavirus epidemic, women have shown their powerful will, professionalism, selfless devotion and great resilience alongside their male peers.\nRelated posts:\nWHO decision makes little effect in curbing China; New strategies needed for Malaysian tourism US travel alert an overreaction, shows unilateralism: experts A staff member, wearing a facemask, waits for customers near the Forbi...

Markk Perete said the NBI will be tasked to determine what laws were violated and to file the appropriate charges.\nBut he refused to \u201cspeculate\u201d what charges will be filed as it will depend on the evidence gathered during the investigation. There is, at present, no law defining and punishing \u201cfake news\u201d in the Philippines.\nPolice on Sunday arrested a man in Legazpi City who feigned collapsing in a mall, pretending to be a victim of nCoV, but who later admitted it was just a prank for an online video. Albay Police filed a complaint for alarm and scandal against him on Tuesday. Watch more in iWant or TFC.tv\nDespite the filing of the complaint, Perete said the NBI investigation will proceed independently since the prankster may have committed other crimes.\n\u201cAn act may violate a number of laws and the violator may be prosecuted accordingly, taking into consideration of course the rules against double jeopardy (when and where they become applicable),\u201d he said in a message exchange with reporters.\nDouble jeopardy prohibits the trial of an accused for the same or similar charges following an acquittal or conviction.\nPerete also said the NBI\u2019s directive to investigate is \u201cbroad enough to encompass other cases of possible spread of misinformation related to the nCoV which may not have been the subject of the PNP complaint.\u201d\nThe DOJ order came after an emergency meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte and Cabinet officials in Malaca\u00f1ang on Monday and a Senate probe on Tuesday into the Philippine government\u2019s response to the virus, which some netizens have criticized for lack of transparency and for being slow.\nAsked what prompted the directive, Perete said there is a need to ensure public order and safety, especially in times when there are \u201ccircumstances that agitate the public.\u201d\nMore than 400 persons have died from nCoV, including a 44-year-old Chinese man visiting the Philippines who died due to severe pneumonia in a government hospital in Manila last Saturday.\nThere is so far only one other confirmed nCoV case in the Philippines\u2014that of a 38-year-old female companion of the Chinese tourist who died. She was declared the first case of nCoV in the country.\nHealth authorities have repeatedly warned the public not to believe unconfirmed reports about the presence of other supposed nCoV cases.\n\u201cPersons who unnecessarily aggravate such agitation through actions violative of our laws cannot be allowed to unjustly claim protection under the basic guarantees of the Constitution,\u201d he said, fielding questions from reporters about the possible effect of the directive on freedom of speech and of expression. FREEDOM OF SPEECH\nA 2008 case, Chavez vs. Gonzales, struck down as a form of prior restraint the statement of then-Justice Secretary Raul Gonzales and a press release from the National Telecommunications Commission warning radio and broadcast media that the airing of \u201cHello Garci\u201d tapes will result in the cancellation of their certificates of authority.\nThe Hello Garci tapes supposedly showed then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo instructing a Comelec official to rig the 2004 polls.\nThe Supreme Court said the warning regulated the content of the speech and prior restraint could only be justified if there is a clear and present danger sought to be avoided.\nPerete clarified the DOJ directive does not violate freedom of speech and of the press.\n\u201cTo clarify, the DO [Department Order] issued by the Secretary does not impose any prior restraint on speech or expression. Neither does it restrict any action,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cIt merely directs the NBI to investigate certain acts already committed, and if warranted, to file the appropriate complaint before the proper body,\u201d he added.\nShare",

        "content": "The recent outbreak of the Corona Virus Epidemic has caused considerable distress and morbidity among the affected population. The current treatment measures are helping just to a certain extent while no satisfactory treatment regimen is available for managing sequelae of the acute phase.2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), most commonly known as Coronavirus is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. It was detected as a cause of respiratory sickness outbreaks in Wuhan (Capital of Hubei Province), China. The virus is believed to have originated late last year in a food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. Health experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another animal species. Coronavirus is an infectious disease that can be transmitted between animals to humans and human-to-human. The novel coronavirus infection that first broke out in Wuhan, China, has spread to 25 countries so far. As of 4th Feb 2020, at least 361 deaths and 17,205 cases of the virus have been reported from China while new infections are being reported around the world. The WHO reported 146 confirmed cases in 23 countries outside China including 3 cases in Kerala, India. Symptoms and Diagnosis A common sign of infection includes respiratory symptoms, cough, fever, breathing difficulties or shortness of breath and diarrhea. Infection can cause the severe acute respiratory syndrome, pneumonia, kidney failure and even death in more severe cases. It is estimated that it takes 2 to 10 days from exposure to onset of symptoms by the World Health Organization. Analysis of the recent outbreaks has suggested that the increased severity of the disease may be due to a change in genetic sequence and the virus attacks on cells and begins replicating to cause an Infection. It all depends on the virus\u2019s lifecycle and replication rate that how fast the virus spreads throughout the body. It rearranges the membrane of cells and stimulates them to fuse together. This process causes sufficient damage to host tissues to shut down the body\u2019s immune system, to fight with viruses, infections and other diseases. Treatment and Vaccination Unfortunately, the vaccination is under investigation and not available for Novel Coronavirus. The efforts are already underway by global organizations, governments, and private companies, but it may take months. There is no specific management for Novel Coronavirus. Vaccine. Symptomatic treatment is recommended. The line of management is usually the rest, Intravenous fluids, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents. Correlation of Ayurveda and Siddha Medicine with Preventive Measures Ayurveda - the science of life, and Siddha - means achievements, the twin medicine system in India are the comprehensive system of health care of ancient wisdom, based on experiential knowledge and grown with perpetual additions. Original dimensions of Ayurveda are inbuilt in the ancient compendia of Indian wisdom called Vedas, which are believed to be documented around 6000 years back. About 65% of the population in India is reported to use Ayurveda and medicinal plants to help meet their primary health care needs and the safety of this vibrant tradition is attributed to time tested use and textual reference. The concept of epidemics is very well defined and established in Ayurveda and Siddha. Acharya Charaka (1500BC - 400AD), the great physician of Ayurveda had mentioned epidemic conditions under the head \u2018Janapadodwamsa\u201d. The contamination and vitiation of various factors like\u2013 Jala (water), Vayu (air), Desha (place) and Kala (season), are considered to be responsible for the production of communicable diseases which can be well correlated with modern science. Susruta (1500BC-500AD) has very clearly defined such diseases under Oupasargika yoga i.e., communicable diseases\nNumerous methods of prevention and controls of epidemics, measures for environmental sanitation finds an important place in Ayurvedic and Siddha literature. It has also been mentioned that the natural the course of the disease and its treatment may vary according to the period, geographical extent, eco-climatic conditions, and psychosomatic constitution of an individual and so on. Certain new disease entities may also appear in the course of time that has no identity and they may be managed through suitable drugs and procedures based on the symptom profile, taking leads from authentic literature. This provides us a basic ideology of creating evidence on safety and efficacy through Reverse pharmacology. Today water-borne diseases, environmental diseases, epidemiological disorders and seasonal disorders due to infections can be correlated with Janapadodhwamsa Vyadhis. Evidence of Contagious Disease Treatment By Ayurveda Various communicable diseases like Chikungunya, Dengue, Swine flu, etc. which were declared as global emergencies earlier, The observations drawn from medical camps and documented reports collected from various parts of the country revealed that the Ayurveda and Siddha regimens certainly have a role in cure and management of the symptoms of these diseases effectively. This would immensely help for taking forward the leads from Ayurveda and Siddha for further scientific validation on safety and efficacy in the Coronavirus condition also through systematic experimental and clinical studies. Ayurveda and Siddha offer a number of single drugs, compound herbal and herbs-mineral combinations, maybe rationally used to combat such conditions. It is evident from the above description that the Ayurveda has an enormous knowledge of the mode of spread, nature of microorganisms and how to combat the disease long back. The krimis, bhutas, grahas, rakshas, and agantuka nidana are all microorganisms maybe a virus, bacterial and fungal organisms. Charaka has given three main processes for treating the krimi rogas: These are Nidana parivarjana (to avoid the factors responsible for the production of disease), Apakarshana (removal of krimi from the affected site) and Prakriti Vighata (changing the environment, which favorable for the growth of microbes).\nIn Siddha system of medicine, the treatment modalities are categorized into Symptom modifiers- to say the drugs which improve the Quality of Life providing strength or resistance against the disease such as Jvara hara (anti pyretic) ; Sotha hara (anti-inflammatory); Vedanaa hara (analgesics) ; Kasa hara (anti tussive) ; Swasa hara (anti dyspnoeic); Atisara hara (anti diarrheal) etc., General health promoters- the agents that alleviate symptoms and facilitate early recoveries such as Balya (Tonic) and Rasayana (Immunomodulator) Vector control measures/agents -that are mostly physical measures for environmental cleanliness like Dhoopana ( for Fumigation) and Bhuthaghna & Rakshoghna (Antimicrobial agents). The concept seems to be very similar to the modern microbiology and practice of medicine. Though there is no direct reference to Coronavirus, it can be equated with the prevailing conditions to some extent. How Ayurvedic Products Can Prevent? It is always necessary to take action before it is late. As a preventive measure, some of the herbs-minerals like Holy Basil, Giloy (Heart-leaved Moonseed) Amla, Winter Cherry, Turmeric, etc, produce the antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory and therapeutic effect and effective in all age groups, for stronger immunity, better digestion, healthy liver functioning, metabolism, and a balanced hormonal function. There are a lot of Ayurvedic formulations are available to cleanse the toxins, and provide nourishment, lubricate and reinstate the balance. This process increases immunity and protects the body against viruses and infections. Ayurvedic products like herbal immunity booster can help boost overall immunity, which helps protect the body against viruses, bacteria, fungi, infections, and even parasites, and empowers energy and resistance. These immune system boosters are usually designed by natural herbs to promote increased energy and helps aid in your body\u2019s ability to fight infection. They help to keep illnesses away and provides optimal immune defense.\nBest Herbal Immunity Booster Ayurvedic formulations with immune-boosting properties are available in tablets, capsules, supplements, and tonics, which promotes overall health and well-being. But finding a trustworthy and reliable product is all that matters. Bio Immunoboosters Capsule by BIOAYURVEDA (One of the biggest Ayurvedic brands ) is one of the most reliable immunity system booster , formulated by completely pure ingredients such as Giloy (Heart-Leaved Moonseed, Amla, Turmeric, Green Chiretta, Black Pepper, Moringa, Dry Ginger and many more natural herbs that help to sustain immunity with its anti-inflammatory properties. It helps in enhancing the function of the white body cells that fight infections. It helps in improving the body's response to respiratory infections and improves digestive health. It works remarkably well in activating the immune system to bring overall wellness. Some More Necessary Safety Measures Ayurveda always recommend Diet and Lifestyle adoption, i.e Ahara (Diet) -Always have homemade fresh food, plenty of lukewarm liquids, light, and warm diet, liberally use ginger and turmeric in foods Always avoid food prepared under unhygienic conditions, contaminated and stale food, Cold drinks, beverage, etc., Vihara (Lifestyle)- Avoid visiting the disease prevalent areas Proper sanitation measures to be followed like Regular handwashing with soap and water, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, stay home when you are sick, clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces, etc. are the common recommendations to avoid infection spread. Avoid intimate contact with any person showing signs of respiratory sicknesses like cough and sneezing Coronavirus is an epidemic disorder, there should be continuous upgrading of the knowledge about the infection, transmission, control, virus, vector, and epidemiology. As this the disease is mainly related to public health, the research has to be focused on the geographical extent and spread of the infection, and further research is needed to standardize these formulations by developing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), pharmacopeia standards, stability studies and establishing the safety data of these formulations along with scientific evidence. Various Health Departments have to be actively engaged in patient care, patient education, community education which also includes, organizing various preventive and curative medical camps to tackle this disaster and health menace globally.

        "content": "Could there be a link between climate change and corona virus outbreak? Melting ice caps are releasing some viruses that were lying frozen and dormant for ages. The warming temperatures have stirred them to life and they have woken up with a vengeance. Corona virus could be one of them, they say. It has so far taken 362 lives and laid sick more than 14,000 people. The viruses attack the species lower in the food chain. Insects, animals and birds have immunity much lower than humans, hence are the first to catch the virus. Humans that come in contact with such animals get infected. Scientists have known all along that infectious disease transmission patterns are likely to be a major consequence of climate change. To back it with evidence, work is on at World Health Organisation to study the underlying relationship. Results of these studies will help predict future impacts, using better validated models. Instead of panicking, scientists say, it is better to take the necessary precautions as there is no known cure for corona virus yet. Places that have high temperatures are safer as the heat will kill the virus, scientists say, giving a ray of hope in an alarming scenario. Frequently clean hands by using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water; When coughing and sneezing cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue \u2013 throw tissue away immediately and wash hands; Avoid close contact with anyone who has fever and cough; If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early and share previous travel history with your health care provider; When visiting live markets in areas currently experiencing cases of novel coronavirus, avoid direct unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals; The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, milk or animal organs should be handled with care, to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices. ",

Some are mild, such as the common cold, while others are wide to lead to pneumonia. The incubation of Coronavirus is between 14 - 21 days, and it is an air-borne disease that can be transmitted from one person to another through the air (sneezes and coughing) and through touching (fluid and blood).\nLiberia's Acting Director-General of the NPHIL, Dr. Mosoka Fallah, said that coronavirus disease has also been identified in France, Germany, Canada, India, Finland and the USA of which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Wednesday confirmed five cases of the deadly coronavirus in the USA.\nHe said though the one suspected case in the Ivory Coast has been tested negative, there is no safe country, and therefore Liberia must enhance its screening, monitoring, and surveillance at every entry point and every health center or hospital.\nHe said the world is at 'Code Red' for the Coronavirus. \"The coronavirus disease can be transmitted without symptoms, it's fast, deadly, an air-borne disease and can be transmitted by touching,\" Dr. Fallah intoned.\n\"As of Wednesday, 6,711 cases were identified but this morning, it was reported that 7,711 cases have been confirmed in China. So it means that the fast-evolving and deadly coronavirus affects 1,000 persons daily,\" Dr. Fallah said.\nDr. Fallah made the assertions on Thursday, January 30 -- during the House's 7th day sitting. He added that the 4455 emergency number has been activated, screening at the Robert International Airport (RIA) has been enhanced and the manifestos of passengers that have arrived from China in a month's time has been followed.\nDr. Fallah also said over 100 Liberian students studying in China are expected back home because their schools are shut down as a result of the coronavirus disease. The NPHIL and Health Ministry according to him are preparing to receive them, but need authorization for quarantine.\nLiberia's Medical Officer and Deputy Health Minister Dr. Francis Kateh announced that US$3 million is needed to prepare and furnish the Precaution Observer Centers (or quarantine centers); create the case management system, equip laboratories, fund the psychological support groups, employ and equip more surveillance workers, purchase personal protective equipment, including gloves, mask among others.\nHe said since January 22, health authorities have issued the first preventive measures on the \"washing of hands\" at all public buildings. He appealed to the Legislature to insert washing stations at the Capitol Building and members of the Legislature must always wash their hands and be screened, and their temperature checked.\n\"At a certain point in time, masks will be distributed in the communities and we need more of them,\" Dr. Ketteh said.\nRepresentatives Maima Briggs Mensah, Byron Zahnwea, Mike Jurry, Abu Kamara, Samuel Kogar, Ben Fofana, Ivar Jones Richard Koon, and Joseph Somwarbi encouraged the House of Representatives to approve the US$3 million for the health authorities to initiate early preventive measure.\nRepresentative Vicent Willie urged the health authorities to also make the outbreak of Lassa Fever in the country an emergency because cases are confirmed in Bong and Grand Bassa Counties.\nMeanwhile, Representative Dixon Seboe, upon hearing an announcement that Redemption Hospital is one of the quarantine centers for those infected with the coronavirus disease, seriously took an exception and said the Borough of New Kru Town is very populated for infected coronavirus patients, which is spread by air-borne and touching, and therefore Redemption Hospital cannot be an ideal place.\nHe further argued that some nurses are careless and would indirectly spread the virus. In response, Dr. Kateh said the quarantine centers are built in line with international standards to hold any kind of disease, and the nurses are trained to handle infected diseases. As for the Lassa Fever outbreak, Dr. Fallah of NPIHL said more has been done in the counties, including treatment and prevention as well purchasing of cutlasses and shovels for residents to clean their communities to drive away rats because Lassa fever is carried by rats.\nHouse Speaker Dr. Bhofal Chambers thanked the two health experts and said the House will draw-up the appropriate resolution for the funding after consultations.\nAhead of request by the health authorities to make available US$3 million for intervention in the overclouding health issue, the Government of Liberia through the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning has appropriated the amount of US$1.5 million towards the Coronavirus disease, according to Senator(Dr) Peter Sonpon Coleman.\nThe latest appropriation comes when health authorities including Mosoka Fallah of National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) and Deputy Health Minister Francis Kateh had appeared before the House of Representatives requesting the government to allott the health sector US$3 million to prepare for the disease as it rapidly spreads across the world.\nBriefing the Senate yesterday on the preparation of any possibility of the virus entering the country, Senator Coleman asserted that the government's decision is intended to keep the health sector prepared to avoid the unfortunate situation that occurred during the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak.\nThe Senator who chairs the Senate Committee on Gender, Health, and Social Welfare informed his colleagues that the chairs of the Ways, Means, and Finance of both Houses are knowledgeable about the appropriation made by the Ministry of Finance, and assured that they will definitely bring same before the Legislature.\nDr. Coleman was responding to a concern raised by Grand Bassa County Senator Nyonblee Karnga-Lawrence on the need to document everything that will be useful to start preparing for any eventuality of an outbreak. \"We are concerned about the resources and what kind of capacity we have to handle such a situation; because we have a serious issue with the health system, with some hospitals down. I think it will be fair for us to have that documented, and to have the proper thing done when it comes to expenditure and planning, because we don't know to what extent this will go, it might require more money and we don't want to start making that mistake from the beginning.\"\n Liberia Health\nSenator Coleman disclosed that documentation is being concluded through the collaboration with Liberia's international partners, including the Center for Disease Control (CDC) through its West Africa sub-office in Accra, Ghana.\nDr. Coleman further disclosed that infrastructure is being erected where would-be infected individuals are to be taken care of, and that daily update is now taking place at the Ministry of Health on the Coronavirus. The government, Senator Coleman intimated, will soon be reintroducing the precaution method used during the outbreak of the Ebola virus-washing hands and avoiding handshake, and may include using mask if the country gets a confirmed case.\nThe Grand Kru County Senator also told plenary that about 311 people who entered the country from China this month are being traced and will be tested for symptom of the virus.\nWith regard to Liberian students and ordinary citizens currently in the affected areas in China, Dr. Coleman said the government has decided that instead of bringing them home, they stay in areas where they are already quarantined where they can get better care in an improved health environment.\nAs of last evening, there were reports of several countries evacuating their nationals from the epic center of the virus in Wuhan Province, as confirmed cases in China are now over 8,000, with deaths of 171.\nMeanwhile, Vice President and President of the Liberian Senate, Jewel Howard Taylor, yesterday presided over the 6th sitting of the 3rd Session of the Senate, the first this month and last sitting day in January.",

        "content": "Infectious diseases represent an important portion of global public health concerns\u00b8 in particular with regard to the current global outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The challenge of frontline diagnosis in hospitals, clinics and ports is that infectious diseases could exhibit similar symptoms or can be asymptomatic. The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) today announced the development of the world\u2019s most comprehensive automated multiplex diagnostic system (the System) which includes a fully automated machine and a multiplex full-screening panel for the point-of-care genetic testing (POCT) of respiratory infectious disease including the 2019-nCoV.\n(From left) Prof. Terence Lau of PolyU, Prof. Alexander Wai, Vice President (Research Development) of PolyU, and Dr Manson Fok, Chairman of the Board of Avalon Biomedical Management Ltd, present the automated multiplex diagnostic system.\nIn one single test and within approximately one hour, the System can identify 30 to 40 pathogens including seasonal influenza viruses, such as influenza A subtypes H1, H2 and H3; avian influenza viruses H5, H7 and H9; human respiratory syncytial virus; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV); Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and 2019-nCoV. Leveraging the current polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, the system is fully automated from sample nucleic acid extraction and amplification, to signal detection and analysis. The System adopts patent-pending microfluidic and biochemical technologies that achieve ultra-sensitive detection (down to 5 gene copies) and simultaneous differentiation of various pathogens with extremely high specificity. It is also user-friendly, with manual handling not being required throughout the testing process.\"Early and accurate detection of pathogens could contribute to effective and efficient disease control and management, and prevent spreading of any contagious pathogens. It benefits the patients as well because timely therapy can then be applied to prevent complications. The existing challenge is that we lack full panel POCT technologies for early and on-site diagnosis, which should ideally be capable of differentiating between different pathogens at the same time. This newly-developed system could be a practical solution,\" said Professor Lau. PolyU and The University of Hong Kong (HKU) have established the Respiratory Virus Research Foundation (\"the Foundation\") in 2015 and have since then been working on various innovative technologies to tackle existing and emerging respiratory infectious diseases. The Foundation has fostered various collaborations, including those on vaccine and rapid diagnostics respectively. The former is led by HKU Professor Yuen Kwok-yung, Henry Fok Professor in Infectious Diseases, Chair Professor of Infectious Diseases from the Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine; the latter is led by PolyU Professor Terence Lau Lok-ting, Director of Innovation and Technology Development and Adjunct Professor at the Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology. Ir. Professor Alexander Wai Ping-kong, Vice President (Research Development), Deputy President and Provost designate of PolyU, said, \"In this difficult and challenging time that Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland, and even the global community is encountering, it is important that the research community can quickly pool their expertise and resources to develop practical solutions. The PolyU-HKU partnership is a prime example of effective coupling of multidisciplinary innovation and translation.\" The research team for this project is led by PolyU Professor Terence Lau Lok-ting and supported by HKU Professor Yuen Kwok-yung. Through collaborative efforts, the team has spent the past four years to develop the System. In the past year, the team has optimised the System and conducted trials on different clinical samples. In the midst of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, the team has also conducted tests on clinical samples using the system. Professor Yuen commented, \"The System\u2019s versatility and capability will provide for comprehensive monitoring during disease outbreaks or routine surveillance. It will become a crucial technology for ensuring the effective control of infectious diseases, medical diagnosis, and treatment.\"\"This fully automated, quantitative rapid diagnostic platform possesses a proprietary technology which overcomes limitations of existing technologies by ensuring sensitivity \u2014 and hence significantly enhancing the reliability of test results. Most importantly, our innovation can substantially reduce the cost of the microfluidic cartridge manufacturing thus making it feasible for wide adoption. It is ready for mass-scale production,\" added Professor Lau. The research team has received indispensable support from a local biotechnology company Avalon Biomedical Management Ltd for this project. \"We are honoured to be able to participate in this project and are delighted to see this important milestone in the collaboration between Professor Lau and Professor Yuen. We believe this advanced point-of-care diagnostic system can revolutionize the current diagnostic paradigm and provide a powerful tool to fight against infectious diseases,\" said Dr Manson Fok, Chairman of the Board of the company, Executive & Trust Committee member of Macau Henry Fok Foundation and Dean of Faculty of Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology. Humankind\u2019s modern day battles against epidemics remain a major challenge and it is vital that people keep learning from the past and equipping themselves with the best technologies available. Towards this end the research team will continue to urgently focus on developments to ensure the system\u2019s robustness and cost-effectiveness, and to collaborate with relevant parties on clinical trials, regulatory approvals, and frontline applications of this POCT system.

They have also been told to avoid public places, meat from unverified sources and uncooked meat in East Asian cities. They have also been told to wash their hands frequently,\" the source added.\nAccording to an Air India official, all crew members working on flights between India and South East Asia have been asked to wear N95 masks.\nIn India, many people are under observation in hospitals for suspected coronavirus infection including in Maharashtra, Goa, Odisha and the national capital. People returning to the country after visiting China are being regularly screened for the deadly virus at airports across the country.\nNovel coronavirus (nCoV) is a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from common cold to acute respiratory syndromes. The virus, which has killed 132 people and affected at least 6,000 others in China, is a novel strain not seen before.\nIn its statement, IndiGo said on Wednesday, \"After carefully assessing the current coronavirus situation in China, IndiGo is taking some safety measures for its customers, crew and staff. Due to China travel restrictions, we have seen a high number of cancellations from China on our Delhi-Chengdu route and vice versa.\"\n\"Therefore, we are suspending our flights between Delhi and Chengdu from February 1 until February 20. We are also suspending our Bengaluru- Hong Kong flight effective February 1,\" it added.\nThe low-cost carrier stated that these are purely temporary and precautionary measures.\n\"We understand that these measures will cause inconvenience to our customers and we will be refunding the full amount to the impacted passengers,\" it clarified.\nIndiGo added that it is in \"close touch\" with the \"relevant government authorities\" and \"we thank them and our partners in China for all the help and support that they have extended so far\".\nAir India has kept a 423-seater jumbo plane ready in Mumbai to airlift Indian citizens from Wuhan city in China in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.\nWuhan is the capital of China's Hubei Province.\nAs India started the preparations to evacuate over 250 Indians, mostly students, stuck in the Hubei province, its embassy in Beijing said these nationals will have to undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine on their return.\n",

She said: \"The health ministry continues to closely monitor the situation and has reviewed the risk assessment for India and core capacities needed to prepare for and respond to a possible disease importation.\"Sudan directed all state governments to review their preparedness, identify gaps and strengthen the area of surveillance, laboratory support infection prevention & control, logistics, risk communication and in particular, hospital preparedness in terms of isolation and ventilator management of critically ill patients of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI).\"Airport Health Organisations at major international airports have started entry screening to isolate and manage suspect cases,\" she said.On Monday, a high-level review meeting was held at the health ministry. The secretary (health) has written to Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) to facilitate thermal screening at the International airports of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Cochin for the airlines to follow International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) guidelines for managing and notifying anybody reporting illness on flights originating from China and disembarking in India. MoCA has instructed for in-flight announcements for India bound flights.All major international airports with connectivity to China will have advisory prominently displayed for self-reporting by travellers who are ill at the time of disembarkation,\" said Sudan.Sudan has also requested the Ministry of External Affairs to disseminate travel advisory (in local languages) to Indian Embassies in China and adjoining countries for wider circulation and passenger information.According to the health ministry, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme has issued advisory to all States and UTs for SARI surveillance to pick up any travel-related case reported in the community and follow up contacts of suspect/confirmed cases. Meanwhile, the National Institute of Virology(NIV), Pune is fully geared up to test samples of nCoV, if a need arises. ",

Chinese molecular biologists have found out that one of the antibodies discovered during the 2003 atypical pneumonia epidemic can neutralize the coronavirus that sparked the pneumonia outbreak in China and a number of other nations, says an article published in bioRxiv internet library.\n\"We report for the first time that [\u2026] CR3022 could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD,\" the scientists write in their article. \"Interestingly, some of the most potent [\u2026] antibodies (e.g., m396, CR3014) [\u2026] failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein.\"\nThis discovery, according to the scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and Fudan University in Shanghai, gives hope that CR3022 compound, combined with other antibodies that can bind with the new coronavirus, would allow to create the first effective remedies for the novel pneumonia and stop the epidemics. Read also Australian scientists successfully grow China's new coronavirus in lab\nThe scientists have come to this conclusion after they observed how the copy of the RBD protein, which the Chinese virus uses to infiltrate human cells, interacts with various antibodies discovered in patient bodies or created during the 2003 atypical pneumonia outbreak.\nThese viruses are closely related and their RBD proteins are similar, which, the scientists presumed, allowed for a slight chance that these old molecules would also neutralize the new pathogen. On the one hand, those hopes were fulfilled with the CR3022, but the four other antibodies, including the synthetic cure m336, created several years ago in the Wuhan Institute of Virology, failed to react to the viral protein.\nThis discovery has greatly surprised the scientists, since computer models did not indicate that slight RBD differences would make the 2019-nCoV invulnerable to those protein molecules. The scientists now study the infected blood samples, in hopes to find other antibodies that would bind with the coronavirus more effectively than the CR3022 does. The novel coronavirus\nOn December 31, 2019, Chinese authorities informed the World Health Organization (WHO) about an outbreak of an unknown pneumonia in the city of Wuhan \u2014 a large trade and industrial center in central China populated by 11 million people. On January 7, Chinese experts identified the infecting agent: coronavirus 2019-nCoV.\nAccording to recent data, over 6,000 people have been infected with the virus, with 132 people dead. The virus continues to spread in China and other states, including Australia, Vietnam, Italy, Germany, Cambodia, Malaysia, Nepal, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, the US, Thailand, France, Sri Lanka and Japan.\nThe new virus belongs to the same group as the coronavirus of the well-known severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Both viruses have claimed lives of several hundred people in the Middle East and East Asia, causing repeated epidemics, spread through camels and poultry. The initial carriers of the 2019-nCoV virus were bats, the scientists believe.\nAll three pathogens relate to the so-called coronaviruses. They cause similar symptoms: fever, cough, trouble breathing and constant phlegm production. The incubation period is up to 12 days, followed by the strongest fever. Most lethal cases happened due to exhaustion, complications and accompanying infections when left unattended.",

SARS-CoV is thought to be an animal virus from an as-yet-uncertain animal reservoir, perhaps bats, that spread to other animals (civet cats) and first infected humans in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002.\nTransmission\nAn epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000 cases in 2003. Since then, a small number of cases have occurred as a result of laboratory accidents or, possibly, through animal-to-human transmission (Guangdong, China).\nTransmission of SARS-CoV is primarily from person to person. It appears to have occurred mainly during the second week of illness, which corresponds to the peak of virus excretion in respiratory secretions and stool, and when cases with severe disease start to deteriorate clinically. Most cases of human-to-human transmission occurred in the health care setting, in the absence of adequate infection control precautions. Implementation of appropriate infection control practices brought the global outbreak to an end.\nNature of the disease\nSymptoms are influenza-like and include fever, malaise, myalgia, headache, diarrhoea, and shivering (rigors). No individual symptom or cluster of symptoms has proved to be specific for a diagnosis of SARS. Although fever is the most frequently reported symptom, it is sometimes absent on initial measurement, especially in elderly and immunosuppressed patients.\nCough (initially dry), shortness of breath, and diarrhoea are present in the first and/or second week of illness. Severe cases often evolve rapidly, progressing to respiratory distress and requiring intensive care.\nGeographical distribution\nThe distribution is based on the 2002\u20132003 epidemic. The disease appeared in November 2002 in the Guangdong province of southern China. This area is considered as a potential zone of re-emergence of SARS-CoV.\nOther countries/areas in which chains of human-to-human transmission occurred after early importation of cases were Toronto in Canada, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Chinese Taipei, Singapore, and Hanoi in Viet Nam.\nRisk for travellers\nCurrently, no areas of the world are reporting transmission of SARS. Since the end of the global epidemic in July 2003, SARS has reappeared four times \u2013 three times from laboratory accidents (Singapore and Chinese Taipei), and once in southern China where the source of infection remains undetermined although there is circumstantial evidence of animal-to-human transmission.\nShould SARS re-emerge in epidemic form, WHO will provide guidance on the risk of travel to affected areas. Travellers should stay informed about current travel recommendations. However, even during the height of the 2003 epidemic, the overall risk of SARS-CoV transmission to travellers was low.\nProphylaxis\nNone. Experimental vaccines are under development.\nPrecautions\nFollow any travel recommendations and health advice issued by WHO.",

The basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:\n\u2022 Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections. \u2022 Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment. \u2022 Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. \u2022 People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands). \u2022 Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in emergency departments. WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness either during or after travel, the travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their health care provider.

ADPH will use these categories to determine requirements for returning travelers until 14 days after leaving mainland China.\nDr. Burnestine Taylor, medical officer, Disease Control and Prevention, ADPH, stated, \u201cRisk depends on exposure, so those exposed to ill persons are at greater risk of infection. However, the situation is evolving, and risk will depend on how efficiently the virus spreads, and how sick it makes people. Exposure includes, but is not limited to, travel to mainland China or close contact with a person with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. At this time, no cases have been identified in Alabama.\u201d\nHigh Risk (Stay at home. No public activities. Daily active monitoring by ID&O staff for 14 days after last exposure.)

Living in the same household as, being an intimate partner of, or providing care in a nonhealthcare setting (such as a home) for a person with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection without using recommended precautions for home care and home isolation. The same risk assessment applies for the above-listed exposures to a person diagnosed clinically with 2019-nCoV infection outside of the United States who did not have laboratory testing.\nMedium Risk (Remain home. Avoid congregate settings including but not limited to classrooms, shared offices, churches, public transportation, and remain out of public places where close contact with others may occur. Daily active monitoring by ID&O for 14 days after last exposure.) Travel from mainland China outside Hubei Province Living in the same household as, an intimate partner of, or caring for a person in a nonhealthcare setting (such as a home) to a person with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection while consistently using recommended precautions for home care and home isolation. Close contact with a person with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, and not having any exposures that meet a high-risk definition. The same risk assessment applies for close contact with a person diagnosed clinically with 2019-nCoV infection outside of the United States who did not have laboratory testing. On an aircraft, being seated within 6 feet of a traveler with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection; this distance correlates approximately with 2 seats in each direction.

Seven different coronaviruses, that scientists know of, can infect and sicken people. Common human coronaviruses usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, like the common cold. There has been some confusion as to whether a positive coronavirus test result is the virus associated with this outbreak. At this time, if a person has a positive coronavirus test result not performed by the CDC, it is not the novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV and should not be reported to ADPH. CDC is working with state public health laboratories to expand testing capacity. ADPH will report when testing is available within Alabama for 2019-nCoV.",

Someone ate a bat?\u201d My brows furrowed as I thought about this.\nIn my head, a scene played out where someone was hiking through the woods, came across a bat, killed it (with what \u2013 a stone?) and ate it raw.\nI have since learned that bats are a delicacy in other parts of the world. My immediate reaction was telling of the cultural context I live in. Nobody I know eats bats \u2013 I didn\u2019t even know they could be eaten or how \u2013 so my imagination came up with a story.\nBut quickly following that bizarre story my brain concocted was this thought: I have never eaten pigs even though many people I know do. I understand that in their world, it\u2019s OK to eat pigs. Likewise, although I have abstained from beef for much of my adult life and have been an on-again, off-again chicken eater (currently \u2018off,\u2019 in case you are wondering), I haven\u2019t thought it was \u2018weird\u2019 for people to eat cows and chickens because I was raised in a culture that was OK with it.\nWhy are we OK with certain animals being eaten over others? Who are we to judge others about eating particular animals when we consume cows (a forbidden meat in the Hindu religion) and pigs (a forbidden meat in the Jewish and Muslim faiths)? That\u2019s a lot of people who don\u2019t eat cows and pigs. Why are we even OK supporting an industry that is directly related to animal cruelty and the destruction of the Earth\u2019s resources, affecting our climate, but we are disgusted by someone eating a bat?\nREAD ALSO: WHO declares global emergency over coronavirus\nFrom what I understand, people are arguing that wild animals are more dangerous to eat than farmed animals. However, people have gotten sick \u2013 even fatally ill \u2013 from eating farmed animals.\nPiggybacking on those thoughts was this: there is going to be some crazy backlash now against the Chinese community. First, they\u2019ll be blamed (via their eating habits or whatever) and then they\u2019ll be shunned. This happened during the 2003 SARS outbreak which also started in China, and it\u2019s happening now.\nThanks to social media, racist comments are spreading faster than any virus. On Facebook, Twitter, TikTok\u2026you will find comments about people eating wild animals and infecting the rest of the world, and you will see people demanding that Chinese people be quarantined. The silent show of racism also takes place when people frequent Chinese restaurants and stores less often or move away from Chinese-looking people in public places, like on the bus.\nREAD ALSO: Keep calm and wash your hands: B.C. pharmacist\u2019s tips on coronavirus prevention\nNot all viruses become \u2018racialized.\u2019 When I mentioned farmed animals causing people to get sick, I was specifically thinking about mad cow disease which affected mostly the UK. I didn\u2019t hear anybody giving the Brits a hard time for it. The H1N1 flu virus wasn\u2019t racialized; its origin was North America. Why is it when something comes out of China or parts of Africa (like Ebola) it becomes about the people and the place of origin?\nIn addition to the myths about what the actual virus is doing, how many people are dying from it, how one should protect oneself, there are some really harmful ideas floating around that are just as scary as a disease we haven\u2019t yet eradicated.\nMalcolm X likened racism to a \u2018tumour that is malignant in the body of America.\u2019 Maybe we are not focusing on the right disease.\nColumnist Taslim Jaffer writes monthly on multicultural connections.

        "content": " The world is facing a chronic shortage of gowns, masks, gloves and other protective equipment in the fight against a spreading coronavirus epidemic, World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday.\nThe UN agency has been sending testing kits, masks, gloves, respirators and gowns to every region, Tedros told the WHO Executive Board in Geneva.\n\"However the world is facing a chronic shortage of personnel protective equipment, as you might imagine.\n\"This afternoon I will be speaking to the pandemic supply chain network to identify the bottlenecks and find solutions and push (for) fairness in distribution of equipment,\" he said.\nAs of 6 a.m. Geneva time (0500 GMT) there were 31,211 confirmed coronavirus cases in China and 637 deaths, as well as 270 cases in 24 other countries with 1 death, Tedros said.\n\"For the last two days there had been fewer reported infections in China, which is good news, but we caution against reading too much into that. The numbers could go up again,\" he said.\nDuring its technical briefing for member states, there was discussion about naming the virus - which emerged in a seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late December.\nWHO has already assigned an interim name of 2019-nCOV (novel coronavirus) acute respiratory disease.\n\"We thought it very important that we provide an interim name so no location was associated with the name. I'm sure you have seen many media reports that are still calling this, using the name Wuhan or using China,\" WHO epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove told the board.\n\"We wanted to ensure that there was no stigma associated with this virus, and so we've put out this interim name,\" she said.\nDr. Mike Ryan, WHO's top emergency expert, said: \"I think the bigger point here is to ensure that some of the actions, some of the reactions internationally, it is the responsibility of us all to ensure there is no stigma associated with this disease.\n\"The unnecessary, unhelpful profiling of individuals based on ethnicity is utterly and completely unacceptable and it needs to stop. Governments have a responsibility to communicate with their populations on this,\" Ryan told the board.\n ",

        "content": "Clusters of a dozen or so deaths may get nonstop \u201cif-it-bleeds-it-leads\u201d press coverage. But the lack of preparedness for the really, really big threats may be met with virtual radio silence\u2014until panic breaks out.\nThe worst, possibly existential, threat is the stealthy, invisible one that multiplies exponentially\u2014in the accurate sense of the term: 400 cases today, 800 tomorrow, then 1600, 3200, 6400, 128000, 256000, 512000, and 1.024 million after only eight doubling times. Biological threats proliferate\u2014until they run out of susceptible victims.\nIn 1918, the great influenza pandemic killed as many people in 11 months as the medieval Black Death did in 4 years. Ultimately, at least 50 million may have perished. Young healthy people, especially young soldiers headed off to the front in World War I, succumbed quickly. To avoid interfering with the war effort, the U.S. government denied and covered up the threat, preventing the implementation of public health measures.\nSince then, the world has gotten smaller. A virus that jumps the species barrier from animals to humans in a meat market in China can cross the Pacific in hours. And despite the expenditure of $80 billion on a National Biologic Defense, the U.S. is arguably no better prepared than it was in 1918, state Steven Hatfill, M.D., and coauthors in their new book Three Seconds until Midnight .\nAs in 1918, we lack a vaccine or wonder drugs, but must rely on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and on public health authorities to track and try to contain the spread of infection.\nAccurate information is critical. Can we trust governmental authorities to tell the truth? Travel restrictions, quarantine, closing businesses, and cancelling public events have a huge economic and potential political cost.\nThere can also be incentives to exaggerate the threat, in order to sell poorly tested vaccines or drugs. The 1976 swine flu epidemic was almost a non-event; more people were probably injured or even died from adverse effects of the heavily promoted vaccine.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has so far declined to declare the corona virus outbreak a global emergency, although cases have been reported in more than a dozen or so countries. China reported only hundreds of \u201cconfirmed\u201d cases\u2014while countless additional cases were not tested because of lack of diagnostic test kits.\nThe New England Journal of Medicine writes , \u201cAnother Decade, Another Coronavirus.\u201d This 2019-nCoV virus is the third zoonotic (animal) coronavirus to infect humans in two decades. The SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) were contained. Other coronaviruses cause mild cold-like syndromes.\nThis virus has occasioned the quarantine of entire cities, for the first time since medieval times. This could not be done other than in authoritarian China, states virologist Steven Hatfill , but even there is unlikely to be effective\u2014especially if 5 million people had left before the order was implemented.\nThe People\u2019s Liberation Army has sent 450 medical personnel to Wuhan to help out at local hospitals, which are crammed with patients lying in packed corridors. Construction workers are reportedly trying to build a 1,000-bed hospital in Wuhan in five days. The U.S. and other nations are evacuating their citizens from Wuhan.\nA report of 41 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, published in The Lancet , showed that patients were relatively young (median age 49) and fewer than half had an underlying illness. Only 66% had been exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the apparent source of the infection. One patient (2%) had no fever; all had pneumonia; 29% had severe respiratory distress syndrome; and 12% had acute cardiac injury. Most cases may be very mild, facilitating more rapid spread .\nThe corona virus is transmitted by droplets coming into contact with mucous membranes, including the eye. It can persist on surfaces for days. People without fever or symptoms can transmit the illness during the incubation period, which might be as long as two weeks. At present, definitive diagnostic testing is available only from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) .\nIn a severe outbreak, people whose job is not critical may need to stay home. Those who do not have a supply of food, essential medications, or other needed supplies would likely end up in a frantic crowd. Personal protective gear, for people who need to be in contact with the public or care for a sick family member, is already out of stock in medical supply houses. This includes gloves, wrap-around eye protection, and N-95 protective masks\u2014regular surgical masks are probably of little help.\nPanic is never helpful; staying calm is always good advice. But failure to heed previous warnings of the need for robust disaster planning, and complacency about medical technology and governmental resources, has set the stage for potential unprecedented disaster.\nIndividuals need to recognize that they themselves, and not 911 or the emergency room or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, may hold the key to their family\u2019s and their community\u2019s survival. Local authorities need to know that they may be on their own.\nFor now, stock up on supplies; cover those coughs and sneezes; wash hands frequently for at least 20 seconds; avoid crowds; and stay aware, as the situation could change rapidly.

        "content": "What ever the miniscule differences there are between Corona viral types, they must all divides in a viral fashion. This requires the infected cell to be pressurised, and have additional viral RNA tacked on to the end of the DNA,Drug company is are livid one application of High Intensity UltraSound, as medically published by three medical professors from the Moffitt cancer centre 2002, and all viruses are cured.A contact in New York used \u00bd minute of 8 W 1 MHz ultrasound to either side of his chest 2012, and cured his HIV AIDs. I have personally cleared 30 frames are various viral and bacterial infections.It cures all infections. Medics have dreamt up C19 today, Corona19. What happened to Corona1...18? How are the virus types different. This is an old medical trick.You cure an infection, and it changes genome slightly. So to her new medical research, and slightly different drugs.Not with HIUS. It cures all infections that will ever exist. It sets off Molecular Nuclear Fusion in the pressurise cell type. Body cells experience ultrasound pounds above 180 Watts 40 kHz.But the beauty people licensed home ultrasound devices, at 8 W 1 MHz. They clear all limb damage and scarring. I applied to the closed eyes, it will clear corneal scarring and leaving cataracts. Conditions medicine can't even treat! Now all drug research into cataracts and corneal scarring are prohibited.Registered doctors cannot prescribe or research defective medicine. And all cancer drugs became defective medicine as a HIUS Paper was published 2002.Doctors have to be a aware off, validated and use new medical science. So on earth validated one session of HIUS will clear all 200 cancers out there 2002. Or they were struck off, subsequent medical practice all criminal.The biochemical drug company is are voluntary signatures to the Hippocratic oath. So they are used registered doctors to validate HIUS 18 years ago.Then manufacture and sale of cancer drugs became criminal medicine. Striking off the manufacturing drug companies, and at voided their patients.Astra Zeneca continued cancer drug manufacture and sale for eight years. So ceased to be a registered an legal drug company 2002. An there is no way back to legality. They are not alone.Every drug company also continued with criminal cancer drugs. But bought off the National Medical registers, not to strike them off! They went into illegal medical cooporations to do Bio medical trials. No industry regulator is allowed to be active in the industry it regulates.So every medical register on earth was struck off itself 18 years ago. They cannot pass judgment on the medicine utilised by other doctors. As every lawyer Dr. Who works for a register, the struck off.Every court action there had by every medical register on earth, up for retrial at the law society's expense. That is going to really clag up the core systems around the world!Only now, every biochemical treatment for cancers and the diseases of age, is automatically criminal medicine. The prescribing doctors dangerous mass murderers. Killing patients for profit!The Moffitt Paper also covered the cure of viruses using HIUS. Every infection boils and pops, in response to external ultrasound of 8 W 1 MHz. As he pressurised infections cell does molecular nuclear fusion. 1H2O+P+HIUS->He+O+E2+L...X-raySo all varieties of the Corona virus, and totally cleared by \u00bd minute of HIUS to each side of the chest. Just like he HIV AIDs. The drug company is are speechless.This will cure all viruses medicine can't even treat. All now totally cured. Thanks to my PH D work at Sheffield University 2001. As my PH D supervisor pointed out, cancer biopsies in ultrasound scans, fill up with microwbubbles (of helium and free radical oxygen gases). And then pop.He ended my PH D work, as I started talking about ultrasound setting off nuclear fusion. 2(r+s)H2Ol+US->r(He2++O++3e-+E2+L...X-ray)+sH2O2010 and I read the Moffitt Paper and used 180 W 40 kHz externally, to cure cancers, heart disease and diabetes. 2013 and I validated \u00bd minute of 8 W 1 MHz ultrasound to either side of the head, clears all dementia.Which explains why global doctors have shut the hell up about dementia. As MS, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and schizophrenia and are totally cleared by \u00bd minute of HIUS externally to the head.Doctors borrowed ultrasound sience from physics. Who first developed High Intensity UltraSound, or metallurgical inspections, so HIUS is a bride technology and is outside medical patent protection.Individuals can buy a an 8 W 1 MHz ultrasound massage device over the Internet.Just \u00bd minute each side the chest totally clears Corona as home. No Dr. involvement. Doctors can't even treat mental health problems. High as cures them Coronax, all viruses cured.The Chinese president pbuss pressurise the CDFA (Chinese Food and drug administration) into recommending that all doctors use the HIUS they validated 18 years ago and stop prescribing defective biochemical drugs.Who will then go down in history as the Chinese president who have to cure a serious disease. And not a mass murderer like Mao se'Tung.HIUS cures all bacterial infections. Antibiotic tolerant are not. The HIUS generates the specific an effective human antibody to clear all bacterial infections.Are applying fungal antibiotics, may or may not stimulate production of this affective drug. So of fungal antibiotic prescription has been criminal and defective medicine for 18 years.If your GP has prescribed fungal antibiotics since 2002, they ceased to be registered doctors and all subsequent medical practice criminal. As far as I know, this applies to every supposedly registered Dr. on earth. All struck off!If just one suppose the registered Dr. Has to validate the new medical science and forwarded to they know.All the doctors are rich in the struck off. This same penalty as far applying defective medication. And pills for cancers, viruses and bacterial infections have been criminal medicine for 18 years.So drug companies are looking for versions of the Corona virus, but does not respond to HIUS. But all bacterial and viral infections are cured totally by a single application of HIUS.Biochemical drug prescription has been defective and criminal medicine for 18 years. The prescribing doctors all struck off the medical register, losing Health Insurance. Making all further medical practice criminal.So the way the Hippocratic works just one Dr. reading the Corona cure, has to forwarded to every interested Dr. In the world.C19, same as C37. All totally cured by 1 minute of HIUS. And president Xi Janping will ensure that every Chinese Dr. Uses the new life saving medicine, that is HIUS. Or go down in the history books as one of the biggest mass murderers ever.",

The new strong Coronavirus has proven that it starts finding a new host even during its incubation period in the current host which means the disease spreads even before the symptoms start surfacing in a patient.\nWithin hours of the Corona epidemic was detected scientists are working hard to create an anti-vaccine shot that could cure the disease. The Chinese government was also quick in releasing the genetic code of the virus which will help researchers and scientists to start working on an anti-vaccine.

It says it is following the progress of a number of research facilities, including the three supported by Cepi(Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations). These researches are still at an early stage at all the facilities in the race to find a new vaccine. Given the rate of spread of the Coronavirus, it could only be hoped that the vaccine shot is developed within an outbreak setting. ",

Chinese New Year\nThe Chinese follow a lunisolar calendar. The first day of the Chinese New Year always begins as a New Moon Day. The Lunisolar calendar divides a year into 24 solar terms.",

What is Coronavirus?\nThe virus first emerged in Wuhan in December and since then, China has confirmed 9 deaths with total cases rising to 440. Its origin is told to be a seafood market in Wuhan, which has since been sealed off.\nThe never-before-seen virus has been linked to a family of viruses which is similar to the deadly (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) SARS and (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) MERS viruses and it results in a pneumonia-like-illness with symptoms like runny nose, cough, sore throat, possibly a headache and fever that can last for a few days.\nTo give you an idea about the gravity of the situation, MERS killed 3-4 out of every 10 patients whereas the rate for SERS stood between 0-50% before these were contained globally.\nThe virus usually spreads through animals, which is the reason why animals are not being allowed to enter Wuhan anymore. ALSO READ New Invention Physically Rips Anti-Biotic Resistant Bacteria to Shreds\nKnown by its technical name 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the virus has sparked fear, not just in China but across the globe as WHO has warned of the possibility of sustained human-to-human transmission of coronavirus.\nThe human-to-human transmission differs from limited person-to-person transmission. In human-to-human transmission, a virus can easily transfer from one person to another and then onto the next whereas it dies out after infecting a few people who are in close contact in case of person-to-person transmission. Coronavirus Cases\nTo counter the spread of the virus, a number of countries, including the US, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Malaysia, have started screening for symptoms at major airports.\nIn alarming news, the first confirmed case of coronavirus has been identified in the United States. The reports claim that the person diagnosed with the disease has a travel history of China.\nHowever, a few countries have already identified confirmed cases of the illness, including: China: 440 confirmed cases",

However, many of the traditional Ramadan activities cannot be carried out this year because, under the circuit breaker, gatherings in places of worship are not permitted as precautionary and preventive measures to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.\nWhat were the scenes in mosques before the Covid-19 outbreak?\nMuslims prayed in large congregations, with congregants positioning themselves next to one another, row after row, facing the qibla (direction of prayer towards the Kaaba in Mecca), united in the worship of God.\nUntil last year's Ramadan, mosques had been holding the iftar (breaking-of-fast session) with people sitting side by side in long rows taking the meal together.\nDignitaries - including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, ministers and MPs and others from the various religious organisations - have had the experience of taking iftar with Muslims.\nApart from preparing food for the mosque iftar, there was the cooking of bubur (spiced rice porridge) for free distribution to the public.\nMuslims donated generously to meet these expenditures.\nUsually, after the tarawih prayers - the special Ramadan night-long prayers - people would gather in a group to read the Quran, as reading and completing it during Ramadan is a blessed deed.\nAnyone can join the group. Taking turns, they would read the Quran audibly, a section or two a night, until the whole 114-chapter Quran was completed a few days before the end of Ramadan.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted all these mosque activities. Now that Muslims cannot go to the mosque for the tarawih prayers, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore has produced a guidebook on \"how they can perform special prayers and practise their faith (at home) while doing their part to prevent the spread of the coronavirus\". The guide is also available online.\nA largely empty street in Geylang Serai on Thursday. Many of the traditional Ramadan activities cannot be carried out this year because, under the circuit breaker, gatherings in places of worship are not permitted as precautionary and preventive measures to fight the coronavirus pandemic. PHOTO: AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\nUsually, on Aidilfitri (Celebration of Charity), large numbers of worshippers would throng the mosque for the one-hour early morning Aidilfitri prayer.\nThen, from about noon of the day, Muslim families would start their silaturrahim (strengthening of ties) visits to the homes of relatives and friends, where food and kuih-kuih (cakes and snacks) are served and eaten together.\nThis whole-day exciting movement of people in new and bright costumes now will not take place this Aidilfitri - which falls on May 24 - as the circuit breaker has been extended to June 1. The safety advisory of \"stay home, observe social distancing, wear masks when going out for necessary tasks\" has to be adhered to for the good of everybody in Singapore.\nRelated Story In Pictures: Muslims around the world begin the month of Ramadan amid coronavirus pandemic Related Story Islam's holiest sites emptied by Covid-19 as Ramadan begins What Singapore Muslims would miss most is the Ramadan aura in the mosques. There is definite sadness, but Muslims have to sacrifice customary practices that encroach on physical contact and close proximity interactions during this emergency period.\nAlso, this is the time to show empathy and compassion to the unfortunate victims who might be of any nationality or religion; it is not for lamenting the inconvenience caused by circuit breaker restrictions.\nPeople need to obey rules strictly to contain the spread of the deadly virus. The stay home advisory can be taken to show resilience in facing the calamity positively, and to experience a new but temporary lifestyle - such as working from home, taking the trouble to teach children in the absence of their teachers, and taking it as an opportunity to be closer to one's children, as well as paying more attention to elderly parents.\nRelated Story Muslims mark Ramadan with unprecedented coronavirus lockdowns Related Story Coronavirus: Support for Muslim workers at dorms during holy month of Ramadan The opportunities for spiritual development and charitable acts are not lost but, rather, can flourish while at home - fasting, performing daily obligatory and voluntary prayers, reading the Quran, making donations to charity, and settling zakat fitrah (an obligatory contribution by all Muslims in Ramadan) online.\nThe spiritual and charitable virtues already gained from past opportunities can be manifested in empathy and sympathy to those affected by the bleak situation - victims, as well as over-stressed healthcare personnel - through various contributions, monetarily or in kind, and from being united with all people in Singapore in fighting the Covid-19 crisis together.",

At the center of the epidemic is the city of Wuhan. Wuhan is the largest city in central China with 11-15 million citizens. To contain this virus, China has shut down the city of Wuhan. The airport has been shut down and people are restricted from leaving or driving into the city. Schools, non-essential government offices, and most businesses have been closed. Christians are reporting challenges with lack of public services such as electricity, water, etc. There are problems buying food, supplies, baby formula, etc. The situation is desperate. The church has sent out a letter to the world Christian body asking for prayer. Translation of Letter from house church in Wenzhou: A public prayer letter from the Wuhan Church, asking the Chinese Church to pray urgently! God full of compassion and mercy, we lay prostrate before you and confess our sin. We have sinned against you, our city, our country, our compatriots, and we ourselves are short of Your glory. Wuhan and the surrounding cities have now been closed, and the spread of the virus has exceeded our capacity. The city is surrounded by the shadow of death. We, the covenant people who have received great grace, cry out to You oh Lord, asking You to forgive us for our pride, and ignorance. Our neglect has created this global disaster. Today, we repent for our sins. Please purify our hearts. Save us oh Lord from this great calamity. Forgive our sins and transgressions. Save us from disaster. You are the only one who can save us. Help us not to hide ourselves, but may we have a strong sense of social responsibility to serve the elderly and the children. We send special prayers for the protection of those living in poverty in the countryside villages. We pray for our fellow citizens of the city of Wuhan to prevent the spread of this virus. May they no longer take this situation lightly. We pray to you Almighty Lord, to send warm weather so that this virus has no hospitable environment in which to live. We pray that You provide protection over the other cities as well. Oh Lord, we remember the healthcare workers in particular. Protect them as they serve the sick. We pray for Your mercy Lord. Our bodies are weak and vulnerable like dust in the wind. May we come to you with a heart of repentance. Help us to preach Your message, remain upright and righteous before you, and lead a clean life with a transformed heart. Only You give peace and hope. Merciful God, You are slow to anger and abundant in love. Please remove this plague, hear the cry of Your people, and have mercy on the city of Wuhan.

As reports of the corona virus increase, more and more people in Japan are accessing these masks. Replenishment problems with face masks\nHowever, it is becoming increasingly difficult to buy them because the shelves in the drugstores are increasingly empty and the producers have problems with replenishment. \u201cEvery day within a few hours of the opening, we no longer have masks,\u201d said an employee in a drug store in the Shinjuku district. \u201cIt\u2019s been like this since the corona virus broke out.\u201d\nOther shops in the area have similar problems. Most of them said that face masks are usually sold out by 10 a.m. and daily deliveries don\u2019t arrive on time. Others had to limit the number of masks that each customer can buy to prevent a customer from emptying the entire inventory.\nClever, a manufacturer in Toyohashi, Aichi Prefecture, announced that it has received almost 20 times the number of orders for high quality face masks from domestic and foreign customers. The company, which typically receives 10 orders per day during this time of year, instructed all employees involved in the manufacture of other products to concentrate on the manufacture of the masks. It is still unclear whether the masks will help to fight coronavirus infection\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we cannot keep up with demand,\u201d said company president Eri Ishibashi. \u201cThe particle size of the new corona virus is not yet known, so we cannot even say with certainty that these masks will be effective.\u201d\nSurgical masks that are sold in drug stores are mostly designed to keep bacteria out. On the other hand, N95 surgical masks are used to prevent virus inhalation and the spread of infectious diseases.\nIn any case, doctors recommend wearing face masks so that they completely cover the nose and mouth and there is no distance between the mask and skin so that no virus is inhaled. However, the most important thing is to wash your hands thoroughly and frequently.",

        "content": "The Ministry of Health wishes to advise the public of the occurrence of a newly discovered novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which has been associated with an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan City, capital of Hubei Province in China. On 31st December 2019, the China Country Office of the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, detected in Wuhan City. A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus by Chinese authorities on 7th January, 2020.\nCoronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases, such as, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). These viruses are zoonotic, meaning that they are transmitted between animals and people. A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain which has not been previously identified in humans.\nCases have been reported in Wuhan City and provinces outside of Wuhan in China. Other countries including Thailand, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the United States have now reported cases. The latest reports indicate that there have been nearly 500 confirmed cases with 17 deaths.\nThe Ministry of Health will continue to monitor the occurrence of this novel virus with ongoing updates to the public.\nCommon signs of infection with this virus include:\nIn more severe cases, infection can cause:\nStandard recommendations to prevent the spread of this infection include: covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.\nThe international medical community, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the regional Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) are concerned that this new virus can result in a pandemic (a worldwide occurrence of the virus) as occurred with SARS and H1N1 avian influenza. Should the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) become more efficient at human-to-human transmission, the threat of a pandemic will increase dramatically. The global nature of travel and trade could increase the likelihood of the risk of rapid transmission around the world in a very short period of time.\nBased on currently available information, however, WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel or trade. Today, at the conclusion of the first meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee the decision for declaration as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) was deferred until a second meeting scheduled for tomorrow. At this time, it is expected that additional information from WHO experts on the ground in China would be considered.\nCountries are encouraged to continue strengthening their preparedness for health emergencies in line with the International Health Regulations (2005).\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Health will continue to utilize the established interim guidelines published by the WHO on how countries can prepare for this virus. This includes how to monitor for sick people; test samples; treat patients; control infection in health centres; maintain the right supplies; and communicate with the public about this novel coronavirus.\nThe Ministry will continue to build on its existing national plans, which were implemented to address viruses, such as, SARS and Influenza H1N1 which occurred in a similar fashion. Our aim as always, is to limit the effect on the population and prevent social disruption as much as possible.",

Death toll has jumped to 132. Among the confirmed cases, 1,239 patients were in critical condition. In a meeting, yesterday with WHO Director General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu in Beijing, Chinese President Xi Jinping has expressed confidence that China will conquer Corona virus. WHO said that China has agreed with its proposal of sending international experts to China to facilitate better understanding of the Novel Corona virus and guide global response to the disease.\nAIR correspondent reports that WHO is continually monitoring the situation and it can reconvene the Emergency Committee on very short notice as needed. WHO is also launching a Global Clinical Data Platform to allow Member States to contribute anonymized clinical data in order to inform the public health clinical response. China has said, it is likely to have a vaccine for public use within three months. As per Chinese scientists, the number of people infected with this virus will peak in a week to 10 days and the fatality rate is expected to drop in coming weeks.

I couldn't bear my envy though tinged with admiration when i read that a 10000 bed capacity hospital was built in just 10 days ! of course by making 7000 people work for it .Would we erect such facilities so quickly in a emergency situation thus?Thankfully such a situation hasn't risen so i have no need to speculate and i hope that it never arises.\nIf i am taken as a sample of what a majority Indians feel then won't a finger be pointed at us for sabotaging Chinese economy by releasing a lab manufactured virus in their midst and watch the wreckage with glee.Who knows , we may have the capacity to create such virulent strains of corona virus but i doubt whether we have the heart or the petty mindedness or cunningness or the sly guts to trifle with such a powerful neighbour . .But there are countries that are more powerful than China what if one of them had done it ?\nWhen i was thinking on these lines the Russian President [ex KGB]came out with his observation that it is US which has done some mischief.I had this doubt myself not because i have a Communist streak in me which holds US responsible for all strife's in the world, but because for several years now i find myself in midst of foreign spies,Indian spies and defence intelligence and sly and devious persons and in all probability this constant touch with them has rubbed off on me, leaving me with some of their suspicious thinking as well . i like and feel grateful towards Russia for always standing by India in all its crisis over the decades and donot like the European countries or US poking thier nose in our internal affairs but in all other aspects i have no grouses against US and Europe .\nOther wise i would blame the revolting Chinese food habits like eating snakes , bats and everything that moves ..\nI have few other theories as well --\n1.Maybe a disgruntled person or persons in China would have released the virus to settle scores with the establishment .\n2.Maybe Muslim countries that can develop this virus has released it in China as punishment for locking up Chinese Muslims in camps so as to de radicalise them .\n3. It could also be the handiwork of non state actors ,the saviours of persecuted Muslims all over the world to lock down China with biological weapons.\n4.Even Tibetians have their angst at Chinese ,but poor souls they definetly donot have the resources to develop such weapons.\n5.Maybe the sheer envy of millions all over the world over China's break neck development has made China stumble and has made it to pause on its tracks.

        "content": "No confirmed 2019-nCoV in Tacloban City By: Morexette Marie B. Erram January 24,2020 - 04:37 PM LINES OF DEFENSE Passengers arriving on international flights wear surgical masks as they face immigration officers at Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 1 in Pasay City, where measures are in place to monitor possible carriers of the new and deadly coronavirus strain. \u2014RICHARD A. REYES\nCEBU CITY, Philippines \u2013 There is no confirmed case of the 2019 novel coronavirus, simplified as 2019-nCoV, in Tacloban City in Leyte province.\nQuoting the press conference conducted by the Department of Health in Eastern Visayas (DOH \u2013 8), the public information office (PIO) of the Tacloban City Government issued the advisory today, Friday (January 24), on their official Facebook page.\n\u201cThe Department of Health (DOH) 8 said there is no reported case of the novel coronavirus in Tacloban,\u201d the city\u2019s PIO stated.\nRead more: DOH secretary Duque urges netizens not to spread unverified claims of coronavirus infection\nThis developed after unofficial and unverified reports claiming that a foreigner residing in Tacloban City was allegedly admitted in a hospital upon returning from a visit at Wuhan City in China.\nThe 2019-nCoV came from Wuhan City in Hubei province in Central China. Wuhan city is now under lockdown as authorities attempt to contain the virus from spreading.\nTacloban City\u2019s PIO also stated that their region\u2019s DOH head will \u201cnot deny, nor confirm\u201d the claims made on the viral posts.\n\u201cDuring a press conference earlier today, DOH Director Minerva Molon said it will \u201cnot deny, nor confirm\u201d the posts circulating on social media regarding a suspected coronavirus patient confined in a hospital in Tacloban as there is government protocol based on World Health Organization guidelines that need to be considered.\u201d it added.\nThe local government of Tacloban City likewise advised its constituents to refrain from sharing unverified information in order not to cause \u2018undue panic\u2019 amid the threat of 2019-nCoV.",

        "content": "A deadly new coronavirus has now reached at least 13 countries. With every day new cases being reported, there are currently 2794 confirmed cases of the virus, while tens of thousands of people are being kept under medical supervision around the world. Eighty-one people have died with the virus, according to latest reports.\nMore deaths are predicted to follow. The virus can spread before symptoms show, China\u2019s health minister Ma Xiaowei, which means it will be more difficult to limit transmission between people.\nThere are confirmed cases of the virus across Asia, and in the US, Australia and Europe. Confirmed cases have also been reported in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, the US, Australia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, France, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada and Nepal. All of the recorded deaths have so far been in Hubei province.\nGrowing outbreak\nThe scale of the outbreak will depend on how quickly and easily the virus is passed between people. It appears that, on average, each person infected with the virus passes it to between 1.5 and 3.5 other people, according to an analysis by Natsuko Imai and her colleagues at Imperial College London.\nBut there is still much we don\u2019t know about the virus, and some researchers suggest that it could spread more quickly than estimated. One study, estimates that each person with the virus can pass it to between 3 and 5 other people. The work, by Shi Zhao at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and his colleagues suggests that the virus is much more contagious than originally thought.\nThompson\u2019s estimate was calculated based on the assumption that the virus isn\u2019t contagious until symptoms show and this no longer seems to be the case. \u201cIf the virus is able to spread before symptoms show, that could certainly explain why the virus is spreading quicker that SARS,\u201d says Thompson.\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cautions that, although only five cases the US so far, person-to-person spread of the virus in the country is \u201clikely to occur to some extent\u201d.\nSo far, the new virus seems to have a lower fatality rate. Based on the number of reported cases and deaths, the rate appears to be around 2.8 per cent, compared with a 9.6 per cent rate for SARS. But it is too soon to be sure just how dangerous the virus is. We are still in the early days of the outbreak, says Thompson.\nThe virus is spreading more quickly than SARS. The SARS outbreak was over by 2004, there have been no reported cases since then. Health agencies brought the virus under control by isolating people with the virus, and screening air travel passengers. Such measures will be more difficult with a virus that can be spread before symptoms appear.\nThere is also always a chance that the virus could mutate to become more contagious or deadly. However, there is no evidence yet that the virus has mutated within people, and the World Health Organization (WHO) told a press conference last week that the virus appears to be stable.\nSo, how worried should we be?\nThe WHO is still holding off from declaring a public health emergency of international concern, although the organisation says the risk of the virus is \u201cvery high in China, high at the regional level and high at the global level\u201d.\nThe CDC describes the outbreak as a \u201cvery serious public health threat\u201d. \u201cI am pretty worried about the current situation,\u201d says Thompson. He expects the WHO to officially declare a public health emergency if and when the virus begins to spread between people outside China. \u201cI\u2019m definitely nervous about it,\u201d he says.\nSlowing the spread\nIn the meantime, health authorities in China have undertaken unprecedented measures in an attempt to control the spread of the virus. Wuhan, where the outbreak began, has been placed on lockdown \u2013 public transport has been shut down, the airport is closed, and the use of personal motor vehicles has been banned. Immigration services in the city have been suspended in Wuhan. Several other cities have also been placed in lockdown, affecting tens of millions of residents.",

        "content": "The first novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection in Thailand was reported on 13 January 2020, making it the first country outside China to report such infection.\nAccording to a study by the University of Southampton\u2019s WorldPop team, Thailand topped the high-risk countries from coronavirus .\nThe coronavirus outbreak has hit Thailand after a weak third quarter for the economy. Thailand\u2019s economic growth slowed down to 2.4% in Q3 2019.\nThe Thai government has taken a number of fiscal and non-fiscal measures to contain the impact on the well being of its people as well as its economy. Thailand coronavirus update: New cases confirmed\nConfirmed cases reached 34, including one person in serious condition, by 16 February. Out of the confirmed cases, nine are Thai citizens and 24 are of Chinese origin. Evacuations by the Thai government\nThe Thailand government evacuated 138 Thailand citizens on 04 February from Wuhan, China. The evacuees arrived at the U-Tapao airport aboard a Thai AirAsia. They were checked for symptoms and sanitised upon arrival.\nOut of the 138 evacuees, six have been transferred to hospitals upon detecting high temperatures and the rest will be quarantined for a period of 14 days in a naval resort in Sattahip. Hospitals treating or testing Thailand coronavirus cases\nDoctors at the Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok have reportedly succeeded in using a combination of HIV drugs including lopinavir and ritonavir and the antiviral medication oseltamivir, as quoted by Reuters.\nRecently confirmed cases are being observed and treated at Queen Sirikit Naval Hospital in Sattahip. Other hospitals either testing suspects or creating awareness to the public are Nakhon Pathom and Samitivej hospitals. Preventive measures by the Thailand government\nThailand raised its travel advisory to level 3 on 23 January 2020, advising to avoid all non-essential travel to China. The Department of Disease Control (DDC) is screening all arriving Wuhan to the Suvarnabhumi, Don Mueang, Chiang Mai, Phuket, Chiang Rai, and Krabi airports. It has also placed health surveillance systems at 28 other airports.\nScreening measures have also been placed at all hospitals admitting patients with symptoms of the including fever, cough, and sneezing. Health educators have been advised to perform screening within the community and alert any cases to the DDC on its hotline number 1422.\nThe Thailand government denied entry to the MS Westerdam cruise ship , as a precautionary measure, despite no suspected cases being reported. The ship with 1,455 passengers and 802 crew on-board was also denied entry by ports in Guam and Manila before being allowed to enter Cambodia on 13 February. How prepared is Thailand to deal with the epidemic?\nA note by the Thailand Embassy stated that Thailand was Asia\u2019s most prepared country in the event of an epidemic, as ranked by Johns Hopkins University, and sixth out of 165 countries globally.\nThailand ranked second in having a robust health system capable of treating the sick and protecting healthcare workers. It was ranked third in the prevention of the emergence or release of pathogens.\nThailand\u2019s Ministry of Public Health launched the \u2018Big Cleaning Week\u2019 on 04 February to make the general public aware of personal hygiene practices at the workplace, home, and public places. Hotel operators have been advised to monitor the health of tourists for coronavirus symptoms. Thailand coronavirus outbreak: I mpact and measures\nChina being the biggest exporter of goods to Thailand, a negative impact on trade is imminent. China accounts for approximately 20% of Thailand\u2019s imports. Thailand\u2019s exports to China are feared to come down by $65m approximately, according to the Thai National Shippers\u2019 Council as reported by Reuters.\nThailand already saw a weak Q2 2019, during which the exports fell by 7.9%, while Q3 was no different. The services sector offset the slow down caused by the manufacturing sector, but may not rescue the economy in Q1 2020.\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of Thailand\u2019s trade:\nIndustries that are expected to be hit by the coronavirus outbreak in Thailand are tourism, shipping, and hospitality (including hotels and restaurants). Fiscal measures to contain the coronavirus impact\nThailand took immediate fiscal measures to reduce the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak.\nThe Thai Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) announced its decision to reduce the policy rate by 0.25% from 1.25% to 1%. The decision was taken following an assessment of the Thailand economy, which is expected to witness a slower growth rate in 2020 owing to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak and the delay in the enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act.\nThe MPC noted that the financial stability of the country was vulnerable and more accommodative monetary policies would help in alleviating the negative impact caused by the outbreak. It recommended that liquidity provision and debt restructuring will help the businesses and households impacted and hence recommended the policy rate cut. Non-fiscal measures: Minimising the impact on tourism\nTourism is a crucial sector for Thailand, with Chinese tourists accounting for the majority of the tourist population. The services sector alone accounts for approximately one-tenth of Thailand\u2019s GDP.\nHealth concerns over coronavirus have led to a decline in the number of tourists arriving in Thailand. The Thai Tourism Ministry estimates that the coronavirus impact could result in a revenue loss of 50 billion baht ($1.52bn) for the tourism industry, as quoted by Reuters.\nThe Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) assured that precautionary measures have been placed to ensure the safety of tourists. It also noted that all events, shops and attractions including Thailand\u2019s events and festivals planned between January 2020 and March 2020 would continue as per schedule.\nThe government is also taking preventive measures such as: Placing screening systems at popular tourist spots such as Asiatique The Riverfront Advising visitors to wear masks Providing alcohol-based sanitisers and masks at attractions such as Siam Niramit Performing additional cleaning and disinfection across public transportation\nTo avoid further decline in visitors, The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) assured visitors of strong measures to maintain hygiene and prevent the viral spread.\nThai authorities are also considering to limit export of surgical masks to avoid shortage in the country, the demand for which has been surging since the epidemic\u2019s outbreak. Thailand exports approximately 400 million masks a year. Coronavirus in Thailand: Issue of health cards to travellers\nTAT is also issuing Health Beware Cards to travellers arriving in Thailand, which can be shown to doctors in case of feeling symptoms such as fever, cough and breathing difficulties within 14 days of arriving in Thailand.

It was originally written in Cantonese style Chinese translated to English. Worth a read.About the virus:1. It is pretty large in size (cell is about 400-500nm diameter), so any normal mask (not just the N95 feature) should be able to filter it out. However, when someone who\u2019s infected sneezes in front of you, it will take a great 3 meters (about 10 feet) before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne. 2. When the virus drops on metal surface, it will live for at least 12 hours. So remember if you come in contact with any metal surface, wash your hands with soap thoroughly. 3. The virus can remain active on fabric for 6-12 hours. Normal laundry detergent should kill the virus. But if you are really worried, you can add some non-chlorine bleach or oxygen bleach . For winter clothing that does not require daily washing, you can put it out under the sun to kill the virus. About the symptoms of the pneumonia caused by Coronavirus:1. It will first infect the throat, so the throat will have the dry sore throat feeling which will last for 3 to 4 days2. Then the virus will blend into the nasal fluid and drips into the trachea and enter the lungs, causing pneumonia. This process will take 5 to 6 days. 3. With pneumonia, comes high fever and difficulty in breathing. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You will feel like you are drowning in water. It\u2019s important to go seek immediate medical attention if you feel like this. About prevention:1. The most common way of getting infected is by touching things in public, so you must wash your hands frequently. The virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 mins, but a lot can happen in those 5-10 mins (you can rub your eyes or pick your nose unwittingly lol).2. Aside from washing your hands frequently, you can gargle with Betadine Sore Throat Gargle to eliminate or minimize the germs while they are still in your throat (before dripping down to your lungs.",

Let's look at some numbers:\nCalifornia has fifty-three votes in the US House of Representatives while Wyoming has one.\nAs a percentage of the full House, California's delegation makes up 12 percent of all votes while Wyoming's makes up 0.2 percent.\nIn fact, California's representation in the House is so large that California House members outnumber members from an entire region of the US: namely the Rocky Mountain region. If we add up all eight states of the Mountain West (Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico) we come up with only thirty-one votes. Moreover, many of these states have split delegations (as with Arizona and Colorado) and rarely vote as a unified group. California, on the other hand, has only seven Republican House members out of fifty-three, meaning that the state's delegation tends to reliably vote together.\nCalifornia even enjoys a sizable advantage in the electoral college as well. It is true that the electoral college formula evens things up somewhat. California representatives wield more than 10 percent of all electoral college votes, and Wyoming enjoys only 0.6 percent of all votes. Now, if the Rocky Mountain region were to vote together for a certain candidate, it could theoretically, almost equal the power of California. But, the region doesn't vote together, with Colorado, New Mexico, and Nevada often going for one party while the rest of the region goes for another. Thus, California, because its electoral votes are centralized, brings more power to presidential elections than the entire Rocky Mountain region.\nSo, while it's true that Wyoming's two votes in the US Senate make it easier for a Wyoming-led coalition to veto legislation that favors California, the same can be said of California in the House. While California and Wyoming theoretically have equal power in the Senate, Wyoming has essentially no power in the House, and could not possibly hope to do much to overcome opposition from California House members. The fact that voters in Wyoming have more US senators per person hardly places people with California-type interests at the mercy of people with Wyoming-type interests.\nEssentially, the system as it now functions places significantly more veto power in the hands of California in the House. At best, though, Wyoming has only an equal veto to California in the Senate. Veto power, of course, is one of the most important aspects of US legislative institutions, since it is designed to help minority groups protect their own rights even when lacking a majority. This is the philosophy behind the Senate's filibuster, and the philosophy behind the bicameral legislature. The purpose is to provide numerous opportunities for minorities to veto legislation pushed by more powerful groups.\nThe importance of protecting minority rights, of course, is a mainstay of the ideology we used to call \"liberalism\"\u2014the idea that people ought to enjoy basic human rights even when the majority doesn't like it.\nAll that is out the window, however, where progressives and other leftists suspect they are in the majority, in which case the protection of minority groups is null and void. Suddenly, the Democratic majority is the only thing that matters.\nHad rank majoritarianism won the day in the past, Indian tribes, Catholics, Quakers, and Japanese Americans would have all been extirpated or run out of the country a century ago. But the sort of prudence that put some limits on the power of the majority in the is now thoroughly unfashionable on the Left. The Left now strains to grasp the opportunity to rid themselves forever of even what small amount of legislative resistance can be offered by the hayseeds in flyover country.\nThe fact that California gets more than fifty times the votes of North Dakotans isn't enough for progressives. They must also stamp out what limited influence North Dakota has in the Senate as well.\nThis sort of thinking suggests that in order to make the US more \"democratic\" large minorities of voters\u2014voters with specific economic and cultural interests that differ from those in other regions\u2014ought to be rendered essentially powerless.\nAll that said, I endorse the plan from the Harvard Law Review Milhiser is pushing. It undermines the idea that the US's current state boundaries are somehow sacrosanct and that enormous states with millions of people are a perfectly fine thing. The US and its member states are far too large, and could use a thorough dismembering. But Milhiser should be careful what he wishes for. 1. I should note there's nothing wrong with dividing up the US into a large number of small states. It's just that the scheme ought to encompass the entire country rather than just a tiny of part of it with the goal of helping a single political party. Indeed, most US states are far too large and ought to be broken up into far smaller pieces: ",

Let us begin with a quote from our Constitution of India.\n\u201cIt shall be the fundamental duty of every citizen of India to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform\u201d .\n(Constitution of India, Article 51A(h), Fundamental Duties)\nThe recent outbreak of Corona virus (nCoV) in Wuhan, China, and its spread has forced the WHO to declare a state of global emergency. Countries worldwide with their policy makers and medical professionals are trying their best to contain the spread of this virus.\nIn this scenario, the AYUSH ministry , a part of Indian Government, together with CCRH (Central Council for Research in Homeopathy) , had brought out an advisory mentioning that the Homeopathic Medicine Arsenic Album 30C as a \u201cprophylactic\u201d . It is also worth noting that, days after the notification, they were forced to withdraw it in principle due to the furore it created among the citizen of india, who were abiding by the above quote from the constitution of India. The AYUSH was in fact publicizing and withdrawing medicines, without any serious thought or by understanding the gravity of the current nCoV pandemic. This clearly objectify the incompetency of the AYUSH research bodies.\n29/01/2020 29/1/2020 \u201c Prophylactic \u201d is a medicine or course of action used to prevent a disease. Now , both the AYUSH department and the CCRH has clearly demonstrated that it does not understand the depth of the meaning of the term \u201cprophylactic\u201d. We are living in a scientific era and science and technology has advanced to a very higher level. Modern Medicine has been very forthcoming in this matter in admitting that they do not have any specific medicines or vaccines against the current nCoV infections. Even here, The AYUSH failed to understand what is implied if it is said that \u201cNo medicines are available as of now\u201d. They failed to acknowledge that, disclaiming is as important as claiming something, especially in situations like this. Also, it looks like AYUSH was indeed trying to proselytize alternative medicine by utilizing such a global emergency.\nThe question which arises here is: does Homeopathy has any evidence of the action of efficacy of Arsenicum Album 30C in Corona virus infections? Before answering this the AYUSH ministry must answer the following basic questions, which form the basis of any critical evaluation of any type of information meant to be used on a massive scale for the public health.\n1. Where did they find the information? Did they hear about it from a colleague or friend? Did they find it through a thorough search of a database? 2. What is the nature of the evidence ? Does it report the findings of a study, is it a review of evidence or is it an opinion piece? 3. How has AYSUH come to this conclusion? How was the research carried out and what methods were used? Did the researcher make a logical argument? 4. Who has produced the research? Is the author an academic, a journalist, a commentator or an organisation? Is there a danger of bias? 5. When was it written? Is this old or new research? 6. Why has it been written? Who funded the research? Is the research aimed at a particular group of people? (Adapted from Aveyard, H., Sharp, P. and Wooliams, M.(2011) A beginner\u2019s guide to critical thinking and writing in health and social care. 2nd ed. Maidenhead: Open University Press.)\nI am sure that the experts in the CCRH are familiar with these procedures as they are the apex \u201cRESEARCH\u201d body for Homeopathy in India. However, their advisory clearly demonstrates that they have overlooked the basic steps in any research process and jumped into the process of suggesting the so called \u201cpreventive\u201d, conveniently forgetting the fact that Arsenicum Album 30 do not have any published research paper which has a statistical evidence in showing that it has any anti-viral properties.\nCCRH in this incident has exhibited a total disregard for public health and safety, a lack of prudence and utter callousness bordering on arrogance. Let us not forget that this is a publicly funded body which is being supported by the tax payers\u2019 money and such irresponsible behaviour brings forth just one question:\nDO WE NEED SUCH AN IRRESPONSIBLE INSTITUTION WHICH DOES NOT EVEN KNOW THE BASICS OF RESEARCH? HOW LONG ARE THE TAX PAYERS GOING TO PAY FOR THIS NOT ONLY USELESS BUT ALSO HARMFUL INSTITUTION? That is a question which not only Homeopathy Doctors, but also policy makers should be asking at this juncture.\nDr.Pramod Chandran\nCommonwealth Scholar-Dementia Studies\nUniversity of Stirling, UK\n",

        "content": "Ilocos propaganda statement posted to the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) Website (Feb 1, 2020): The new Corona virus is a neoliberal disaster\n\nDuterte attempts to deflect criticisms while people call for his ouster\nIt could be called a classic case of too little, too late but even that would be an oversimplification of the issue. What is clear is that the Duterte regime is now on a full-blown defensive mode after receiving widespread condemnation regarding the government\u2019s mishandling of the 2019 new Corona virus (nCoV).\nWorse Viruses: Irresponsibility and Unaccountability\nThe National Democratic Front \u2013 Ilocos deplores the Duterte administration\u2019s desperate efforts to deflect criticisms instead of focusing on crisis management. After finally deciding to stir from unacceptable silence, Duterte spoke up regarding the virus that grips the nation in a state of near-panic. However, instead of communicating the government\u2019s measures against the virus\u2019 effects, he chose to dismiss the casualties as a non-issue.\nIn reality, though there are only two confirmed cases of nCoV in the Philippines, the death of the second patient is the only fatality outside China where the virus supposedly originated. And yet, he grievously delayed banning travellers coming in from mainland China, Macau and Hong Kong; that is, until the backlash was so great even he could not ignore it anymore. Before this, the best he could do was promise to hold a meeting regarding the outbreak a week after it started. Meanwhile, the people were expected to sit still.\nLike a tyrant in a tower so removed from his constituents, Duterte does not understand that his ill-preparedness and belittlement of the virus itself is the cause for the people\u2019s almost panic. He predicts that the outbreak \u201cwill die a natural death\u201d as if he is a circus soothsayer and not the highest official of an entire nation. And yet, it was reported that Malaca\u00f1ang Palace required all its personnel to wear masks while any physical contact with Duterte was prohibited.\nWhile Duterte vainly attempts to change the narrative, his trusted lapdog Bong Go spews tirades against those that criticise the government. Like a rabid mutt that has lost any sense, he wanted to quarantine a wide range of individuals\u2014from those that justifiably called out the Duterte regime for its relaxed approach to the crisis to those who called for Duterte\u2019s ouster.\nIlls of Neoliberalism\nOn the other end of the defense line, the delusional Health Secretary Francisco Duque denied that the country has a weak health system. He reasons that the Philippines is \u201ca middle-income country.\u201d Hence, it is excluded from the World Health Organization\u2019s concerns.\nHowever blinded Duque is, the neoliberal policies that undermined the healthcare system are the same policies causing Duterte to tread carefully so as to maintain profitable friendship with the Chinese government, at the expense of the Filipino people\u2019s lives and wellbeing.\nNeoliberalism takes form in privatization of social services such as government hospitals and health facilities, among others. So-called aid from private sector is actually public debt.\nPrivatization is the exact opposite of making health services more affordable and accessible to the public. The Philippines\u2019 leading cause of death remain to be diseases that are both preventable and curable.\nIn the same vein, Duterte\u2019s onerous debts to China would actually be paid off through more taxes, not to mention with collateral Philippine sovereignty and patrimonial assets. And now, apparently, with Filipino lives. In true Duterte fashion, the beggarly president then absurdly blamed the Filipino people for being Sinophobic.\nThe Filipino people cannot rely on the Duterte administration to protect them from the nCoV. It can neither expect Duterte to own up to his own loyalties nor put an end to neoliberal policies. Thus, the mass movement in the Ilocos Region will continue to link arms with the rest of the nation in exposing and opposing neoliberalism that murders and displaces the people in ways more cruel than nCoV itself. It expresses its solidarity with the entire Filipino people in defeating the nCoV and using this issue as one amongst many for the ouster of an inutile and oppressive regime. More importantly, the armed revolution in the countryside will continue to flourish and advance in order to completely demolish the rottening system that Duterte embodies.",

accommodation, and transportation to OFWs stranded due to the travel ban imposed on China, Hong Kong, and Macau.\nThe travel ban was imposed by President Duterte as precautionary measure to prevent the spread of the 2019-nCoV.\nWhile the Philippines may still allow entry to Filipinos and foreigners with permanent resident visas, they will be turned over to the Bureau of Quarantine for assessment, Morente said.\n\u201cThese restrictions are in the interest of public health and safety,\u201d stressed PAL spokeswoman Cielo Villaluna.\nCEB has already cancelled its four flights servicing Manila-Taipei effective February 11, 2020 \u201cuntil further notice\u201d to support government efforts to manage the risks from coronavirus.\nRead more: Cebu Pac, PAL cancel flights to

government include barring Filipino nationals from travelling to Taiwan, including the airlines\u2019 flight and cabin crew.\nThe government also bars the entry of foreign nationals, except Permanent Resident Visa holders who come directly from Taiwan, or have been there within 14 days immediately preceding arrival in the Philippines.\nMeanwhile, a Philippine Airlines (PAL) special flight carrying 124 passengers, including some 51 Chinese holders of permanent visa, arrived Monday at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 2 on board PAL Airbus 321.\nAccording to PAL Spokesperson Cielo Villaluna, special flight PR 335 from Xiamen, China with six cabin crew and two pilots landed at 1:16 pm Monday, carrying some 73 overseas Filipino workers stranded in Xiamen by the travel ban, as well as 51 Chinese with permanent visas, including five children.\nThe aircraft flew to Xiamen at around 7:31 a.m. also on Monday, carrying some 100 Chinese nationals and tourists who had likewise been stranded in the Philippines after the government imposed a ban on travel to and from mainland China and its special administrative regions, as part of anti-coronavirus precautions.\nThe Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO) said on Tuesday that the Taiwan government took offense at the Philippines\u2019 imposition of the temporary travel ban on tourists coming from Taiwan.\nMECO Chairman Angelito Tan Banayo said the Taiwan took issue with the travel ban, not because of the 2019-novel coronavirus scare, but because they were grouped with mainland China, and Hong Kong, and Macau which are Special Administrative Regions of China.\nPILMAT, a group of licensed recruitment agencies deploying OFWs to Taiwan, opposed the inclusion of Taiwan in the travel ban.

        "content": "The coronavirus outbreak continues to dominate news flows this week and is visibly weighing on risk appetite. The spread of the disease is drawing scary parallels with the 2003 SARS outbreak. As such, investor uncertainty is rapidly rising. How Far Has the Virus Spread so Far?\nAs of yesterday, the current infection is just below 3000 with a death toll of just over 80. The increase in infections, as well as the mortality rate, is worrying. A week ago, only three people had died from the disease. In terms of the spread of the coronavirus, the infection has been noted in each of China\u2019s 31 provinces along with confirmed cases in 11 other countries. Of these 11 other countries, which include five confirmed cases in the US, Thailand has the most so far with eight confirmed. Is the Spread Getting Worse?\nSadly, health officials have confirmed that the spread of the virus is intensifying. Over the weekend, the top health minister in China said that the ability of the virus to spread (contagiousness) is getting stronger. He confirmed that the virus can now spread before any symptoms show up. This is a worrying development as it makes it even harder for airports to screen travelers for the virus. Another worrying report over the weekend noted that as many as 5 million people have already traveled out of Wuhan (the epicenter of the virus). The city is now on lockdown. Governments are tracking the travelers who have gone abroad from China in an attempt to stop them from spreading the virus if they are infected. Is this Virus Outbreak Similar to the 2003 SARS Episode?\nThe SARS outbreak in 2003 saw around 8000 people infected over the 4 months before it was contained. Of those infected, nearly 800 died. Clearly, the death toll was much higher in the case of the SARS outbreak. Compared with the SARS outbreak, authorities have also responded much quicker in terms of taking measures to combat the virus. The recent mutation of the virus is worrying. However, if health authorities can get the virus under control in less time than 2003, hopefully far fewer people will die. How is the Economy Being Impacted?\nIn terms of economic impact, China will see the most damage. In 2003, retail sales and the service sector took the biggest hit. The impact this time around could actually be greater as the service sector has grown to 54% of GDP. This is compared with 42% of GDP in 2003.\nIn 2003, retail sales growth fell from 10% to 4.5% annually and a similar impact is likely to be seen this time around due to the countrywide lockdown. Given the residual damage to the economy as a result of the two-year trade war with the US, the economic impact could be severe.This could lead the PBoC to further easing which should weigh on the Yuan Technical Perspective\nThe rally in USDCNH over the last two weeks has seen price reversing sharply back above the broken 6.8982 level. Price is now very close to testing the key 7 level along with the broken bullish trend line from 2018 lows. This is a major level for USDCNH and a break back above here could be very bearish for CNH indeed.",

        "content": "In early January 2020 the world was stirred by a new variant of the virus called the Corona virus. The shape and size of the virus\nWikipedia states that coronavirus is a virus from the coronaviridae family. This virus is round. While its size must be very microscopic, even this virus cannot be seen with an ordinary microscope because it is so small. We know that the page virus can attack bacteria and even destroy it and duplicate itself into a lot of juveniles of the virus.\nWe know that the virus is obligate or pure parasitic, meaning that it can live only by hitching a ride on its host. Viruses are also known to have the ability to survive in crystal conditions or die when not in or not infecting their host. There are so many types of viruses that we know for example are influenza viruses, hepatitis viruses, herpes viruses and HIV viruses.\nViruses compared to bacteria are more dangerous viruses because there are some bacteria that are good bacteria while viruses are all pathogenic or can cause disease. Many diseases caused by viruses can not even be treated, for example, HIV AIDS.\nIn Wuhan City, China was reported to have detected the Corona virus and claimed the lives of humans infected by this virus. The corona virus is thought to have the same resemblance to the SARS virus and is very deadly.\nIt was also reported that the Corona virus could move from a human host to another human without animal intermediaries. But it was stated that this corona virus was found in bats.\nSymptoms of contracting Corona virus\nOne of the most obvious symptoms when humans are exposed to the Corona virus is an increase in body temperature or fever in the respiratory tract and infection or inflammation in the lungs. The name of this disease is often called pneumonia wuhan. This virus was also declared very resistant to antibiotics.\nIt was also stated that this virus could mutate into a more virulent virus. This mutation can be caused by natural factors due to climate change for example or because of mutations by genetic engineering made by humans in the laboratory or often termed as biochemical weapons. Not surprisingly, at this time America and China are in conflict, as well as with other regions including Iran. It is feared because now it is happening Hot atmosphere among the superpower countries in the world may also be a cold war in the form of chemical weapons war. Indonesia as a non-aligned country, although not in favor of any country, but if for example the super power state had an argument and there was a third world war, it would not be denied that Indonesia would be the victim.\nReportedly at this time the Corona virus has entered Indonesia through tourists entering Indonesia via air transportation. It was also reported that one of the foreign nationals was quarantined in one of the buildings in Jakarta because of the Corona virus. One way to detect that a person, especially a foreign citizen who entered Indonesia, was infected by the Corona virus or not, is to use a heat detector. In crowded centers such as airports and / or ports installed heat detection devices on humans and will be seen if the human has a fever then it is immediately checked whether the human has a normal fever or the fever is caused by the Corona virus.\nWe pray that our family and our nation will avoid the danger of this very deadly virus, the corona virus and other types of viruses used as material for biochemical weapons. one of the prevention is by drinking or eating foods containing vitamin C, exercising and checking the body when experiencing high fever to the doctor or to the nearest hospital ",

Cebu Pacific, the country\u2019s largest budget airline, also said they would be pulling out of the line and disinfecting the planes boarded by the patient, based on the recent statement they issued Friday, January 31. They also said cabin crews and pilots showed no symptoms of the disease. The Gokongwei-led airline company will also be implementing the following several precautionary measures in all their international and domestic flights: 1.Cleaning and disinfection of aircraft in between flights. 2. Wearing of face masks by our employees, frontline personnel and cabin crew while on duty. 3. Providing face masks to passengers who show symptoms of illness. When possible, isolation of passengers who manifest symptoms of illness in empty rows inside the aircraft during the flight. 4. Coordination with health authorities in case there are passengers suspected of n-CoV contamination for immediate turn-over and further observation. Cebu Pacific has also expressed intentions to reduce the flights to China, Hong Kong, and Macau. \u201cPassengers who wish to check the status of their flights may do so through the Manage Booking portal on the Cebu Pacific website, https://book.cebupacificair.com/Manage/Retrieve/ ,\u201d the statement said.\nThe patient, now confined in San Lazaro Hospital in Metro Manila, came from Wuhan City.

        "content": "Highlights - The Corona regional epidemic may potentially turn global - Many Chinese cities quarantined; trade, tourism &amp;amp; services hit - Market expecting replay of SARS of 2003 - Commodities-centric sectors with direct exposure to China under watch The Corona virus outbreak in China has emerged as the biggest global worry at the moment. This virus if not contained in time may turn into a global epidemic with adverse implications for travel, trade and markets alike. So far, 106 casualties have been reported \u2013 all in China \u2013 with nearly 4,600 confirmed cases of infected individuals. China has seen travel ban and quarantine measures that could impact local and global trade dynamics. While previous such crises had hurt global equities, a recovery thereafter has prompted investors to draw parallels. However, the potential damage to an already fragile global economy can be high as the treatment to Corona virus is still not available. Investors, hence, should stay cautious on the cyclical sectors. What is Corona? On December 31, 2019, the WHO (World Health Organisation) issued an alert about several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan \u2013 the capital of Hubei Province of China. The virus was termed as Corona virus (CoV), which belongs to a family of viruses that causes illness ranging from common cold to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. The strain has not been previously identified in humans and does not respond to any medical treatment so far. The Corona virus is understood to have been initially transmitted from animals (possibly snakes and bats) -- just as SARS that spread from civet cats, and MERS from camels. It is contagious and what makes the transmission difficult to contain at the initial stage is the fact that its incubation period i.e. time from exposure to developing symptoms is about 3-10 days. Researchers at Northeastern University and Imperial College London estimate that the number of actual infections may be 10 times more than the reported confirmed cases due to this incubation period. The immediate impact The official response started with the lockdown of Wuhan, which has a population of 11 million. As of now, 15 cities of the Hubei province are under similar travel quarantine controls. As the outbreak took place in the run-up to the holiday season, that is Chinese Lunar Year celebrations, the consumption and tourism cycle took a beating. Except for cities of the Hubei province, the impact on manufacturing is yet to be seen as a good set of businesses is anyway shut due to the Chinese New Year. Officially, Chinese holidays are extended to February 2 nationally and February 9 for Shanghai. Since a solution to the Corona virus is work in progress, it is anyone\u2019s guess how long this crisis will stay and to what extent it can impact globally. So far, multiple countries have reported confirmed cases and are looking at measures ranging from isolating the infected person to a travel ban to China and other restrictions. According to the WHO, the current outbreak is still a regional crisis. Financial market impact Markets have started to price in the flu factor in an alarming way. Chinese equities have fallen by 5-6 percent from their January 20 highs. Oil has slumped by more than 10 percent in the past few days and gold is at its 6-year high. Looking at the SARS of 2003, the global macroeconomic impact was estimated at $30-100 billion. It was also estimated that the impact on China\u2019s GDP was as high as 1 percent. (Source: The Impacts on Health, Society, and Economy of SARS and H7N9 Outbreaks in China: A Case Comparison Study by Qiu, Chu &amp;amp; Mao). As far as its impact is concerned, Chinese equities had plunged about 8-10 percent during March-April 2003. Similarly, Mexico stocks during Swine Flu in 2009 and Brazilian equities during Zika in 2016 were moderately impacted by 2-4 percent. In all the cases, however, the equities recovered swiftly post the crises. The scale of the problem calls for a closer look at Ground Zero \u2013the Hubei province. At $595 billion, the province made up about 4 percent of China\u2019s GDP in 2018. Note that the Hubei province is an important center for industries such as metallurgy, automobiles, chemicals and optical electronics. The city of Wuhan constitutes about 1 percent of China\u2019s global trade dynamics \u2013 both exports and imports. Historically, known a major automobile and logistic centre, in last few years the city is also fastly emerging as a hi-tech hub for the optics industry. Takeaways In our base case, we believe that the Corona virus epidemic may have an impact limited to China with a likely extended quarantine and travel ban within the country. This stems from the fact that China this time is better equipped to deal with this crisis than earlier occasions. The recent quick steps may just prevent the problem getting global. In the short term, the adverse impact on Chinese GDP could be larger than earlier occasions due to the clampdown. Further, longer restrictions on travel and work will adversely impact Chinese consumption, services and manufacturing in the short run. Investors should look at this event with abundant caution. The positive trade outlook on account of of the Phase 1 trade deal between the US and China now faces a serious risk. Investors may turn cautious on sectors and companies with direct exposure to China, particularly on the commodities side. Sectors with links to oil such as chemicals and agrochemicals may have to brace for more volatility and potential high cost inventories. The ones that are dependent on raw materials from China like pharma, agrochemicals may face additional headwinds. Large export-oriented sectors of China such as metals and chemicals may possibly turn to higher dumping in India, particularly if there is lower domestic consumption of same. The recent correction in metal prices therefore comes as little surprise. Note that prior to this metal price outlook had turned positive on account of the improvement in the US-China trade ties.",

        "content": "With the mounting concern about the growing Coronavirus we are republishing this article we published 7 days ago, taken from the excellent anti-imigration site Vdare.com , which if true, is hugely important to understanding the potential global growth of the Coronavirus. Unfortunately Vdare does not have a comments section, so it is hard to gauge how much engagement that article has gotten.\nWe have been following the people we think are the smartest Coronavirus analysts, like Chris Martenson at Peak Prosperity , and have not seen anyone address this issue, which is odd, to say the least, considering the implications. We cannot attest to the veracity of the science, but we assume that someone like Martenson could sort it out. If anyone as a connection to him, please bring it to his attention. It is very important. As the days pass, the thesis of this article seems to be being proved out - Chinese are succumbing to it in the hundreds of thousands, but there are hardly any white victims, and what few there are do not seem to be getting very sick.\nMartenson has been putting out daily Coronavirus update videos on his YouTube channel , starting 3 weeks ago, which have been racking up millions of views, a testimony to the quality of his analysis. He has been saying from the beginning that there is a very significant likelihood that this is much more serious than SARS, or anything else we have seen come along, and that mainstream analysis is dramtatically underestimating this risk. He is a good person to follow to understand what is happening.\nHere is one of his recent videos below, to give an idea of his approach:\nHere is last week's article from Vdare's Lance Welton.\nAt the time of writing, 170 people have died of the Wuhan Coronavirus [ Coronavirus Live Updates: Death Toll Rises, as Foreigners are Evacuated , New York Times, January 30, 2020], though that number is bound to have increased by the time this article is published. All of these deaths have been in China. The disease has spread to at least 16 other countries, including Canada , the USA , France, Germany, Finland, Australia, India, Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and a number of East Asian countries [ This is where Wuhan coronavirus cases have been confirmed worldwide , by Eric Cheung, CNN, January 30, 2020].\nThe Main Stream Media, in Western countries, is stoking panic with rolling news coverage on the spread of the possibly Apocalyptic new plague [ Corona Virus Outbreak , by Matthew Weaver et al., The Guardian, January 30, 2020]. But what nobody is openly reporting: the race of the victims. They appear to be all Asians\u2014specifically, the yellow race formerly known ( accurately but now Politically Incorrectly ) as \u201c Oriental .\u201d\nThus two Coronavirus cases were just confirmed in the U.K. [ Coronavirus: UK patient is University of York student , BBC,com, February 1, 2020], But if you read the article, both turn out to be \u201cChinese nationals.\u201d Similarly a recent headline of The Helsinki Times read \u201c First case of Wuhan Corona virus confirmed in Finland , \u201d [January 29, 2020]. But it turns out to be a Chinese tourist in Lapland, not a Finn.\nIn fact, as far as I can tell, all of the confirmed cases have been of Chinese people. According to Sri Lankan radio, the case in Sri Lanka was a \u201cChinese tourist\u201d [ Sri Lanka suspends visa on arrival for Chinese travellers after confirmed case of Corona virus , News On Air, January 28, 2020]. So are the cases in France and the one in the United Arab Emirates [ Coronavirus is spreading as FIVE people in France are now confirmed to have the illness and Chinese traveller from Wuhan is quarantined in Finland , by Sam Blanchard, Mail Online, January 29, 2020].\nIf it is true that only East Asians are dying of, or even catching, Corona, that would be consistent with long-established race differences in the susceptibility to such viruses. This has been explored in a fascinating study, by a group of Chinese researchers led by C. L. Chen of Soochow University, entitled: Ethnic differences in susceptibilities to A(H1N1) flu [ African Journal of Biotechnology, 2009].\nThe authors begin by noting that, from an evolutionary perspective, there is every reason to expect there to be ethnic or race differences in the susceptibility to different pathogens. Races\u2014or, as they call them, \u201cethnic groups\u201d\u2014are breeding populations, long-separated, usually by geography, who are, therefore, genetic clusters adapted to different ecologies. Because they were exposed to different pathogens in prehistory, there are very likely to be race differences in susceptibility to the pathogens and in how well the immune system can fight them.\nMany infectious diseases jumped the species barrier from animals to humans due to our close contact with animals while pursuing agriculture. For this reason, groups that never innovated agriculture, or who only innovated it in a limited form or only relatively recently took it up, can be decimated by flu-like viruses.\nThus the authors observe that the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1918 was three to 70 times more deadly to \u201c natives \u201d in Canada and the USA, as well as to the reindeer herding Saami people in Sweden and Norway, than it was to the rest of these countries\u2019 populations. This is because most white and black people are descended from those who have long practiced farming. The authors add that the Swine Flu Pandemic of 2009 was five times more deadly to Maori people than it was to other New Zealanders.\nThe Corona Virus is closely related to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) [ Coronavirus vs. SARS: Health experts on the key differences between the two outbreaks , by Sam Meredith, CNBC, January 28, 2020], of which there was a major outbreak in 2003 , which also began in China in 2002.\nAccording to Wikipedia (which is, presumably, politically neutral on such numbers), total of 774 people died across 29 countries. This amounted to almost 10% of those who caught it. Potentially in line with the findings of the Chinese researchers, the mortality rate for SARS in Europe was almost nil. Minuscule numbers of people caught it and only one of them died, in France (where there were an, atypically high, 7 cases).\nBy contrast, in Hong Kong the mortality rate from SARS was 17%. In Taiwan, it was 10%. In Canada, it was 17%, but it seems pretty obvious that they were all \u201c Chinese Canadians ,\u201d what with there being so many Chinese people in Canada and documented attempts made to \u201chelp\u201d them (specifically) deal with the virus [see Beyond SARS: ethnic community organization's role in public health \u2014a Toronto experience, By W. Dong, Promotion and Education, 2008].\nIn Singapore, 13% of those who caught SARS died out of 238 cases. Other countries had very small numbers of cases or, as with Vietnam, their medical access would have been sub-optimal, rendering it difficult to make comparisons.\nBut essentially it can be said the SARS was an East Asian disease which, like Corona, can be traced to bats. SARS didn\u2019t severely impact the rest of the world, despite people definitely catching it. It disproportionally killed East Asians. See SARS: The Immigration Dimension II , by Walter Pringle , VDARE.com, April 24, 2003.\nThis effect was so pronounced that, Wkipedia reports , \u201cMany Chinese believed that the SARS virus could be a biological weapon manufactured by the United States, which perceived China as a potential threat.\u201d (Ironically, the financial website ZeroHedge has just been banned by Twitter for reporting speculation that the Corona virus was developed during Chinese research into bioweapons\u2014a ban that ZeroHedge attributes in a scathing post to U.S. capitalists\u2019 notorious desire to appease China).\nThe difference between the two strains: the Corona virus, according to experts, is nothing like as deadly as SARS. Its mortality rate appears to be about 2% . It \u2018s mainly taking people with serious pre-existing health conditions [ Coronavirus vs. SARS: Health experts on the key differences between the two outbreaks , by Sam Meredith, CNBC, January 28, 2020].\nSo if I wanted to tempt fate, then I\u2019d write the following:\nThe Corona virus is a virus that, for whatever reason, East Asians are susceptible to but other races are not, just like SARS. None of our people are going to succumb to this condition. The MSM\u2019s constant hyping is just a way of making people panic, because people are more susceptible to being indoctrinated when they panic.\nBy not reporting the race of those who have caught this disease in Europe, unnecessary panic is being fomented among Europeans\u2026so that they can be more easily inculcated with the message than \u201crace differences don\u2019t exist, because race is a social construct.\u201d\nBut race differences do exist. Race is a biological reality. And these kinds of viruses help to prove that.\nLance Welton [ email him ] is the pen name of a freelance journalist living in New York.

        "content": "Viruses are self reproducing agents smaller than the microscopic bacteria. According to the page 52 of the Encyclopaedia Britannica ,volume 23 suggests as The Editorial and Policy Board of the E.N.M.Paedia Express Multimedia Group of Lagos,Nigeria went to bed while trying to search out for answers and not leave it to some researchers alone ,studies were quite revealing. Antibiotics and synthetic chemicals have proven of little value against viruses as some hope as regards the typical viral facto arose in 1962 when H.E.Kaufmann showed that infections of the eyes by Herpes and Vaccinia were benefitted by certain chemicals . These appeared to inhibit virus growth by making the virus incorporate an abnormal constituent into its nucleic acid which then became useless for multiplication... in 1963,a factor ,N-Methyl-Isatin-B-Thiosemicarbazone was shown by D.J.Baur and co workers to have prophylactic values when given to Small Pox contacts in India. It has being stated that a number of antibiotics are effective against the viruses of the Psittacossis-Trachoma Group.. Isaacs and J.Lindermann described a previously unknown undetected mechanism whereby a viral infections of animals may be naturally halted. A protein called Interferon is produced and liberated by cells under the stimulus particularly of dead or damaged virus. This alters the chemical processes within the cell in such a way that they become unsuitable for viruses growth unlike antibodies ,interferon is effective not only against the virus that evokes it but against many others ,often unrelated viruses... The year ,2017 ,also saw the human micro-biome project coming up full steam in a decade long effort by 53 research groups to assemble something like an Audubon guide for all the micro bides inhabiting our mucosa. This new found knowledge about all the bacteria ,Yeasts ,Parasites and viruses that live in the alimentary canal or our guts ,Skin,mouths,nasal tracts and urogenital tract is helping researchers to devise new fixes for things that once took years for medication... With that knowledge ,scientists are now moving a step further as they are trying to reprogram micro-organisms to release natural anti-biotics ,anti-inflammatory molecules and protective proteins. Researchers have since engineered a Benign .E. Coli Strain to detect specific lipids found in a form of bacteria called P.Aeruginosa ,a drug resistant pathogen that can infect humans and cause pneumonia. The harmless E.Coli finds and Kills these type of invaders and in concept such smart bacterias could remain in a person's body for life while detecting and preventing diseases . What this means is that the answer to healing from a disease or diseases might not lie in an operating room or a pill but within the human bodies itself. Abdulmumini Adeku is a Nigerian Born Scholar and Journalist who lives in Lagos,Nigeria,[using his residual knowledge of natural sciences he had done a deep study of viruses with a view to assisting the global science community to form a concise opinion on the treatment of Coroner Virus and other viral ailments in the future",

The message read: \u201cHi team, please prevent going to Makati Med. My father-in-law informed us just now that one patient tested positive from Corona Virus (sic). Though naka quarantine na (the patient\u2019s already quarantined)...but still. Also please wear surgical mask at all times most especially whenever we are in Enterprise or Makati area because... ang dami talagang galing china (there really are a lot of people coming from China).\u201d The message continued: \u201cGovernment banned direct flights from Wuhan but these people enter through different routes just so they would get out of Wuhan. Mala Train To Busan talaga ang dating (The situation is like Train to Busan) . Pati laging mag (Also always use) alcohol after using the elevator. Thanks thanks.\u201d The message came from a certain \u201cJanelle (Zenith),\u201d as indicated at the bottom of the message. Three readers forwarded the message to Rappler for verification. Rappler also spotted at least two Facebook posts that said the same claim. Rating: FALSE The facts: There is still no confirmed case of the 2019 nCoV in the Philippines as of January 28, according to the Department of Health (DOH). However, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a press briefing that there are a total of 27 persons under investigation as of 1:30 pm, January 28. Three of them have already been discharged as they tested positive not for 2019-nCoV but for other diseases. The Makati Medical Center reiterated the DOH warning against posting unconfirmed information about the novel coronavirus in a post on its official Facebook account. It was shared at 1:36 pm on January 27, or when the message about an alleged confirmed case started to spread. On January 24, the DOH announced that the 5-year-old boy with a suspected case of the new coronavirus in Cebu City tested negative . Rappler has so far debunked 3 claims since the novel coronavirus outbreak. On January 15, a false claim about a \u201cSARS case\u201d reported in a clinic at Shangri-La Plaza in Mandaluyong City came out. More than a week later, another false claim circulated, that there are \u201cconfirmed cases\u201d of coronavirus at the PBCom Tower in Makati. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com Keep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.

        "content": "I am sure you are aware of the corona virus infection that is causing concern around the world. A January 24, 2020 study in The Lancet reported the latest statistics. (1) The fatality rate (so far) from the corona infection is approaching 15%. That is not good news.\nThere is a big HOWEVER here: This Lancet report is based on only 41 laboratory confirmed cases of the recent corona virus strain (2019-nCoV). Keep in mind, the 15% fatality rate is the percentage of hospitalized patients suffering with corona virus. There must be many more people who became ill with this corona virus and recovered uneventfully and therefore, did not seek care.\nThe symptoms of corona virus initially mimic the flu\u2014fever, headache, cough, fatigue and muscle aches. The 41 patients admitted to the hospital all developed pneumonia.\nCorona virus is nothing new. It has been with us for a long time. Corona virus can affect both animals and humans. It is important to keep in mind that most corona viral infections are mild. In the last two decades, there were two serious corona virus infections\u2013severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which both had elevated death rates.\nSo, what can you do? Wearing a mask will not help protect you from becoming ill with any viral infection\u2014corona virus included. I would check that off the list.\nFirst, it is important to maintain optimal levels of nutrients, particularly vitamins A, C, and D. Most people have suboptimal vitamin A and C levels. Both of these nutrients have antiviral abilities and are able to support the immune system when it is under viral attack. If you are not ill, I suggest taking 3-5,000 mg/day of vitamin C. At the first sign of an illness, I would suggest taking 1,000 mg/hour until diarrhea develops, then back off for a time period. For vitamin A, I suggest using 5,000 Units/day if you are not sick and 100,000 Units/day for four days at the first sign of an illness. Pregnant women cannot take these doses. (Note: Take vitamin A, not beta carotene.) Also, vitamin D is very important for fighting infections. I suggest, at the onset of an illness, taking 50,000 IU of vitamin D3/day for four days.\nIodine is essential to not only fighting off an infection it is necessary for proper immune system functioning. There is no bacteria, virus, parasite or fungus that is known to be resistant to iodine. As I have written in my book, Iodine: Why You Need It, Why You Can\u2019t Live Without It, most of the population is low in iodine. If fact, iodine levels have fallen nearly 60% over the last 40 years. The RDA for iodine is inadequate to supply enough iodine for all the bodily tissues. For the majority of my patients, I suggest taking 25 mg/day as a daily dose and more (sometimes 50-100 mg/day) at the first sign of an illness. Iodine can cause adverse effects and it is best used under the guidance of an iodine-knowledgeable doctor.\nTo prevent becoming ill and to avoid having a poorly responding immune system, it is vitally important to eat a healthy diet free of all sources of refined sugar. Refined sugar has been shown to negatively alter the functioning of the white blood cells for hours after ingestion. Finally, it is important to maintain optimal hydration\u2014drink water! Take your body weight in pounds, divide by two and the resultant number is the amount of water to drink per day in ounces. Dehydration ensures you will be much more likely to suffer serious problems from any infectious process.\nConventional medicine has little to offer to prevent or treat corona virus infections other than washing your hands\u2013I agree with that one. It is time for you to take the initiative and learn what other therapies are out there. Your conventional doctor simply has no effective tools in his/her toolkit for this.\nAs for getting the flu shot? Fugetaboutit. It won\u2019t help corona infections and there was a study which found an increased risk in non-influenza infections, including coronavirus, in those that received the trivalent flu vaccine. (2)\nMy last recommendation is to work with a holistic doctor who can give you nutrient IVs when you become ill. Vitamin C, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone IVs can help anyone suffering from an infection. At my office, The Center for Holistic Medicine, we have seen the positive results a holistic approach to combatting viruses can provide. To find a holistic doctor near you go to: www.icimed.com.\n",

Source\uff1aGlobal Times On February 4, 2020, in a community in Nanfeng Street, Xianju County, Zhejiang Province, volunteers are using small speakers to publicize epidemic prevention knowledge. (Photo by Wang Huabin from People\u2019s Daily Online) The fatality rate of confirmed novel coronavirus-related pneumonia cases in China was 2.1 percent as of Monday night, February 3, far below previous international outbreaks of H1N1 flu, MERS and Ebola viruses, Chinese officials said. The death rate for this novel coronavirus epidemic is around 2.1 percent in China, much lower than other epidemics, and since Saturday, we have seen more people recovering from the disease than dying from it, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying made the remarks on Tuesday\u2019s online media briefing. The death rate from the 2009 H1N1 flu in the US was 17.4 percent, and the 2012 MERS death rate was 34.4 percent, while the number for Ebola was 40.4 percent. However, the fatality rate of confirmed novel coronavirus cases in Wuhan was 4.9 percent, significantly higher than the national rate of 2.1 percent, the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC) said at a press conference on Tuesday, explaining that the gap was due to the fact that Wuhan's early treatment capacity was way below demand. There were only three designated hospitals to treat severe novel coronavirus-related pneumonia patients in Wuhan at the early stages, with only 110 beds which were far from enough, said Jiao Yahui, an official with the NHC. Apart from the designated hospitals, patients infected with novel coronavirus were distributed in more than 20 medical institutions across the city, lacking unified management and efficient distribution of high-quality medical resources, causing a relatively high fatality rate, Jiao said. The shortage of medical supplies in the fight against the novel coronavirus is still very prominent at the frontline, especially the shortage of medical protective suits and N95 masks, the commission confirmed. The number of medical personnel dispatched to Wuhan in efforts to combat the outbreak is expected to reach 10,000 in total by Wednesday, Jiao said. A total of 15,000 fever clinics and 2,092 designated hospitals were set up across the mainland to fight the epidemic, meeting basic needs of patients, except for Hubei, center of the epidemic. More than 3,000 medical staff from major hospitals in a dozen of provinces will be dispatched to take over the newly designated inpatient wards in Wuhan that receive critical patients suffering from the virus, Jiao said.

        "content": "I\u2019m sure by now, you\u2019ve all heard of the Wuhan Corona Virus (a.k.a Novel Corona Virus 2019-nCoV). Seeing so many masked citizens in public, it seems that wearing face masks is now synonymous with keeping yourself safe from this virus is now. But what is the best Face Mask for the job? Well, let\u2019s talk about how face masks can help protect you first. How are corona viruses spread\nWhat is it about face masks that can keep you safe from the virus? Well the virus can be transmitted by bodily fluids such as spit, mucus, tears, or even urine. Now coming into contact with these fluids doesn\u2019t automatically means that you\u2019ve caught the virus because your skin is an excellent protective barrier to these viruses. However if you happen to get these tiny droplets containing the virus on your hands and then touch your food, touch a glass where your lips drink from, or rub your eyes, then you\u2019ve just invited the virus through the front door to your body. How does wearing a face mask protect you?\nWearing a face mask will only protect you if you happen to be close to an infected person and they sneeze in your vicinity, and you had your eyes closed. If you have the virus itself, wearing the face mask will reduce your chances of spreading the virus to other people. But one way wearing a face mask can protect you is by being a conscious reminder. If you\u2019ve been out in public, having the mask on will make it a conscious effort to touch your nose or mouth. So, since it\u2019s conscious, you will therefore be reminded to wash your hands before touching your mouth or nose.\nTransmission of viruses is mostly through touching your nose or mouth with contaminated hands. Your hands become contaminated by touching contaminated surfaces that an infected person may have touched. Some examples of these common surfaces are shopping carts, elevator buttons, or hand holds on escalators or public transport. Get your masks now before the shops run out.\nThere is a world wide scramble for face masks at the moment. And there is even news of hoarding and price gouging in certain countries. So, before the problem gets out of hand here, we have done the hard yards and found the most effective face masks for keeping you safe from the corona virus. ",

Dr. Cornelio Cuachon Jr., Aklan provincial health officer, said three children were discharged from the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbucon Memorial Hospital in the capital town of Kalibo and were recovering. A 6-year-old boy from Wuhan City in Hubei province, who was vacationing with his family in Boracay, was confined at the hospital on Thursday, January 23, after coming down with fever and experiencing coughing. A test showed he had influenza, according to Cuachon. Two female siblings from Shanghai City, aged six and eight, were also confined on Sunday. Samples were taken from them and were sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Manila. The three are among the 27 \u201cpersons under investigation\u201d in the country for suspected 2019-nCoV. Dr. Glen Alonsabe, Western Visayas epidemiologist, said 10 persons have been tested in Western Visayas in the past two weeks for suspected 2019-nCoV infection. These include eight persons at the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbucon Memorial Hospital. Dr. Marlyn Convocar, Department of Health Western Visayas director, reiterated the earlier statement of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III that there is no confirmed 2019-nCov case in the country. Health personnel and hospitals in the region have been placed under a Code White alert to prepare personnel and resources for an unconfirmed report of reemerging diseases. Convocar encouraged residents to observe preventive measures, including thorough washing of hands and covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing. Health and quarantine personnel are closely monitoring Western Visayas, especially Aklan province, due to direct flights between destinations in China and the Kalibo International Airport. The flights cater to tourists bound for Boracay Island in Malay town in Aklan. On Monday evening, a group of 150 tourists from Wuhan City flew out from the KIA, the last batch of tourists from the city, who arrived in Kalibo before flights between Wuhan and Kalibo were indefinitely suspended. Chinese tourists are the top visitors on Boracay Island. Several residents of Boracay have earlier called for the suspension of direct flights from China to Kalibo as part of measures to prevent the spread of the disease.",

        "content": "With China's spreading outbreak of a new refrain of the coronavirus (termed 2019-nCoV), one has to wonder how fast this latest threat to human life can spread, particularly given the high density of China's urban areas and the vast numbers of Chinese citizens that travel throughout the world. A recent study by Jonathan M. Read et al examines the rate of spread of this virus and its implications to China's population.\nLet's start with a basic concept, that of R0 or Rnaught. R0 is defined as follows:\n\" R0 is a mathematical term that indicates how contagious an infectious disease is. It\u2019s also referred to as the reproduction number. As an infection spreads to new people, it reproduces itself.\nR0 tells you the average number of people who will catch a disease from one contagious person. It specifically applies to a population of people who were previously free of infection and haven\u2019t been vaccinated. If a disease has an R0 of 18, a person who has the disease will transmit it to an average of 18 other people, as long as no one has been vaccinated against it or is already immune to it in their community. \"\nHere are some examples:\n1.) If R0 is less than 1, each existing infection causes less than one new infection. In this case, the disease will decline and eventually die out.\n2.) If R0 equals 1, each existing infection causes one new infection. The disease will stay alive and stable, but there won\u2019t be an outbreak or an epidemic.\n3.) If R0 is more than 1, each existing infection causes more than one new infection. The disease will spread between people, and there may be an outbreak or epidemic.\nR0 only applies when everyone in a population of people is equally and completely vulnerable to the disease. This means that no one is vaccinated against the disease, no one has had the disease before and there is no way to control the spread of the disease.\nIn 1918, there was a global outbreak of the swine influenza that killed 50 million people. In this case, R0 was estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.8. In a more recent example, the swine influenza H1N1 that came into existence in 2009 had an R0 of between 1.4 and 1.6.\nNow, let's go back to the study by Read et al. In this case, based on current information, the authors of the study estimate the R0 to be 3.8 (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3.6 and 4.0) which is higher than the average of SARS estimated from outbreaks back in 2003. This means that between 72 percent and 75 percent of transmissions must be prevented by control measures to prevent the number of infections from increasing. The high R0 value suggests that sustained human-to-human transmission is occurring in China.\nThe authors then looked forward in time. They predict that, should the epidemic continue unabated in Wuhan, the origin of the outbreak, the number of infected will grow very rapidly. By February 4, 2020, the authors estimated that there will be between 132,751 and 273,649 infected individuals with a 95 percent certainly that there will be 191,529 infections.\nWhile the Chinese government has taken significant steps to restrict travel to and from Wuhan, the authors project that a reduction in air travel will have little impact on reducing the number of infections as follows:\n\u2013 50 percent travel reduction \u2013 12.6 percent infection reduction\n\u2013 80 percent travel reduction \u2013 20.1 percent infection reduction\n\u2013 90 percent travel reduction \u2013 22.6 percent infection reduction\n\u2013 99 percent travel reduction \u2013 24.9 percent infection reduction\nAs you can see, while the reduction in air travel into and out of Wuhan will have some impact on the number of people that are infected by 2019 nCoV, there will still be a very rapidly growing number of newly infected people in Wuhan and the surrounding district. Additionally, there will be a growing number of infected people in other cities throughout China and the surrounding nations as the days pass, thanks to travellers moving throughout the region.\nLet's close with this video from the Event 201 pandemic exercise hosted by The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security held in October 2019 which looked at the preparedness efforts for a severe pandemic:\nIn this mock exercise, the participants estimated that a novel coronavirus could result in the deaths of 65 million people .\nWhile we are still in the early phases of this outbreak, the conclusions of this study would suggest that the current outbreak of this virus could worsen significantly over the coming days and weeks. With the disease being spread during the incubation phase, it is quite likely that it has spread far further than is currently believed. Once all of the pieces fall into place, it is only then that we will know whether this version of the coronavirus will be responsible for a global pandemic.",

        "content": "Health Authorities Seek US$3 Million to Prevent Corona virus By 1 514 Liberia's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Francis Kateh and Acting Director General of the National Public Health Institute of Liberia, Dr. Mosoka Fallah, take oath before addressing the House of Representatives. -As GOL preliminarily allots $1.5 million\n\nWith the World Health Organization having declared the Coronavirus a global public health emergency as of Thursday, January 30, the Ministry of Health and the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NAHIL) are requesting US$3 million from the government to initiate prevention measures against the rapidly spreading outbreak, which is reportedly more deadly than the Ebola virus.\nBesides China from where the virus originated, eight cases have been reported in four African countries; Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Equatorial Guinea.\nThe coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause a range of symptoms including a running nose, cough, sore throat and fever. Some are mild, such as the common cold, while others are wide to lead to pneumonia. The incubation of Coronavirus is between 14 \u2013 21 days, and it is an air-borne disease that can be transmitted from one person to another through the air (sneezes and coughing) and through touching (fluid and blood).\nLiberia\u2019s Acting Director-General of the NPHIL, Dr. Mosoka Fallah, said that coronavirus disease has also been identified in France, Germany, Canada, India, Finland and the USA of which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Wednesday confirmed five cases of the deadly coronavirus in the USA.\nHe said though the one suspected case in the Ivory Coast has been tested negative, there is no safe country, and therefore Liberia must enhance its screening, monitoring, and surveillance at every entry point and every health center or hospital.\nHe said the world is at \u2018Code Red\u2019 for the Coronavirus. \u201cThe coronavirus disease can be transmitted without symptoms, it\u2019s fast, deadly, an air-borne disease and can be transmitted by touching,\u201d Dr. Fallah intoned.\n\u201cAs of Wednesday, 6,711 cases were identified but this morning, it was reported that 7,711 cases have been confirmed in China. So it means that the fast-evolving and deadly coronavirus affects 1,000 persons daily,\u201d Dr. Fallah said.\nDr. Fallah made the assertions on Thursday, January 30 \u2014 during the House\u2019s 7th day sitting. He added that the 4455 emergency number has been activated, screening at the Robert International Airport (RIA) has been enhanced and the manifestos of passengers that have arrived from China in a month\u2019s time has been followed.\nDr. Fallah also said over 100 Liberian students studying in China are expected back home because their schools are shut down as a result of the coronavirus disease. The NPHIL and Health Ministry according to him are preparing to receive them, but need authorization for quarantine.\nLiberia\u2019s Medical Officer and Deputy Health Minister Dr. Francis Kateh announced that US$3 million is needed to prepare and furnish the Precaution Observer Centers (or quarantine centers); create the case management system, equip laboratories, fund the psychological support groups, employ and equip more surveillance workers, purchase personal protective equipment, including gloves, mask among others.\nHe said since January 22, health authorities have issued the first preventive measures on the \u201cwashing of hands\u201d at all public buildings. He appealed to the Legislature to insert washing stations at the Capitol Building and members of the Legislature must always wash their hands and be screened, and their temperature checked.\n\u201cAt a certain point in time, masks will be distributed in the communities and we need more of them,\u201d Dr. Ketteh said.\nRepresentatives Maima Briggs Mensah, Byron Zahnwea, Mike Jurry, Abu Kamara, Samuel Kogar, Ben Fofana, Ivar Jones Richard Koon, and Joseph Somwarbi encouraged the House of Representatives to approve the US$3 million for the health authorities to initiate early preventive measure.\nRepresentative Vicent Willie urged the health authorities to also make the outbreak of Lassa Fever in the country an emergency because cases are confirmed in Bong and Grand Bassa Counties.\nMeanwhile, Representative Dixon Seboe, upon hearing an announcement that Redemption Hospital is one of the quarantine centers for those infected with the coronavirus disease, seriously took an exception and said the Borough of New Kru Town is very populated for infected coronavirus patients, which is spread by air-borne and touching, and therefore Redemption Hospital cannot be an ideal place.\nHe further argued that some nurses are careless and would indirectly spread the virus. In response, Dr. Kateh said the quarantine centers are built in line with international standards to hold any kind of disease, and the nurses are trained to handle infected diseases. As for the Lassa Fever outbreak, Dr. Fallah of NPIHL said more has been done in the counties, including treatment and prevention as well purchasing of cutlasses and shovels for residents to clean their communities to drive away rats because Lassa fever is carried by rats.\nHouse Speaker Dr. Bhofal Chambers thanked the two health experts and said the House will draw-up the appropriate resolution for the funding after consultations. Ahead of request by the health authorities to make available US$3 million for intervention in the overclouding health issue, the Government of Liberia through the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning has appropriated the amount of US$1.5 million towards the Coronavirus disease, according to Senator(Dr) Peter Sonpon Coleman. The latest appropriation comes when health authorities including Mosoka Fallah of National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) and Deputy Health Minister Francis Kateh had appeared before the House of Representatives requesting the government to allott the health sector US$3 million to prepare for the disease as it rapidly spreads across the world. Briefing the Senate yesterday on the preparation of any possibility of the virus entering the country, Senator Coleman asserted that the government\u2019s decision is intended to keep the health sector prepared to avoid the unfortunate situation that occurred during the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak. The Senator who chairs the Senate Committee on Gender, Health, and Social Welfare informed his colleagues that the chairs of the Ways, Means, and Finance of both Houses are knowledgeable about the appropriation made by the Ministry of Finance, and assured that they will definitely bring same before the Legislature. Dr. Coleman was responding to a concern raised by Grand Bassa County Senator Nyonblee Karnga-Lawrence on the need to document everything that will be useful to start preparing for any eventuality of an outbreak. \u201cWe are concerned about the resources and what kind of capacity we have to handle such a situation; because we have a serious issue with the health system, with some hospitals down. I think it will be fair for us to have that documented, and to have the proper thing done when it comes to expenditure and planning, because we don\u2019t know to what extent this will go, it might require more money and we don\u2019t want to start making that mistake from the beginning.\u201d Senator Coleman disclosed that documentation is being concluded through the collaboration with Liberia\u2019s international partners, including the Center for Disease Control (CDC) through its West Africa sub-office in Accra, Ghana. Dr. Coleman further disclosed that infrastructure is being erected where would-be infected individuals are to be taken care of, and that daily update is now taking place at the Ministry of Health on the Coronavirus. The government, Senator Coleman intimated, will soon be reintroducing the precaution method used during the outbreak of the Ebola virus-washing hands and avoiding handshake, and may include using mask if the country gets a confirmed case. The Grand Kru County Senator also told plenary that about 311 people who entered the country from China this month are being traced and will be tested for symptom of the virus. With regard to Liberian students and ordinary citizens currently in the affected areas in China, Dr. Coleman said the government has decided that instead of bringing them home, they stay in areas where they are already quarantined where they can get better care in an improved health environment. As of last evening, there were reports of several countries evacuating their nationals from the epic center of the virus in Wuhan Province, as confirmed cases in China are now over 8,000, with deaths of 171. Meanwhile, Vice President and President of the Liberian Senate, Jewel Howard Taylor, yesterday presided over the 6th sitting of the 3rd Session of the Senate, the first this month and last sitting day in January.

China's Tibet Autonomous Region has confirmed its first case of a patient with a new pneumonia-causing coronavirus, health authorities said Thursday, meaning the infection has spread to all of the country's 31 provincial-level regions.\nThe death toll across China from the new virus has increased to 170, including nearly 130 in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, while at least 7,800 cases of infection have been identified, official media reported.\nAgainst the backdrop of the continuing rise in confirmed cases, the Chinese Football Association said Thursday it will postpone the Feb. 22 start of the domestic league's season to protect the health of fans, players and coaches.\nThe coronavirus, known to be transmitted between humans, has already spread to other Asian nations such as Japan and South Korea, as well as North America, Europe, Australia and the Middle East.\nIn the past two days through Thursday, Finland, the Philippines and India reported their first confirmed cases of the mysterious and deadly coronavirus, as the number of infected pneumonia patients in China has, in recent days, climbed by more than one thousand each day.\nThe Chinese government has been struggling to prevent the expansion of the virus, saying supplies of personal protection equipment for medical experts have become tight.\nAll eyes are on whether the World Health Organization will declare a public health emergency of international concern over the current situation at an urgent meeting convened on Thursday.\nThe new virus is believed to have begun spreading late last year in Wuhan, around 1,000 kilometers south of Beijing. The city is a major business and transit hub with a population of some 11 million.\nZhong Nanshan, head of a high-level expert team in China's government-run National Health Commission, was Quote: d Wednesday by the state-run Xinhua News Agency as saying the new coronavirus originated in bats.\nThe Chinese pulmonologist, who combated the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, said the new coronavirus has the same origin as a virus found in a type of bat in 2017, the news agency reported.\nIn Hubei Province, whose capital city is Wuhan, the number of deaths stemming from the new virus has risen to 162 as of Thursday morning, up 37 from the previous day.\nConcern is mounting that infections will expand further as hundreds of millions of Chinese are expected to return home from their weeklong Lunar New Year holiday, which has been extended to Sunday from Thursday on account of the outbreak.\nJapan and the United States earlier this week sent charter flights to Wuhan to evacuate their citizens. On Thursday, 92 Singaporeans flew back to the city-state from the Chinese city on a specially chartered flight. South Korea is planning to follow suit.\nCoronaviruses generally cause common cold-like symptoms affecting the nose, sinuses or upper throat and are spread through sneezing, coughing or direct contact.\nBut some types lead to more serious, sometimes deadly respiratory diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome, known as SARS and MERS, respectively.\nThe SARS pandemic sickened 8,098 people and killed 774 globally.",

        "content": "There are financial directions you can pick up from almost every area in your life but in light of the recent health scare gripping the world, there are money directions to take away from it as well. There is no denying the fact that it is, first and foremost, a health issue that concerns the whole world. It has been infecting people not only from the country of origin but in other countries as well including the US.\nYou could be hearing news about how people are dying as well as recovering from the virus. Live Science reports the death of over 500 people already . The source of the virus is also being blamed on the consumption of wild animals in unsanitary locations. On the other side of the spectrum, a lot of medical professionals all over the world are working together to find a cure.\nIn the middle of all these, there are financial directions to take away from the situation. If you open your eyes and connect the dots, you will notice that there are lessons you can take away from it. Here are some of them worth looking into. Situations can manifest without any signs\nOne of the financial directions you can pick up from this situation is the fact that problems can come without any warning. Given that there were initial tests and findings on the virus before it spread out to nations, the majority of the people only found out about it as it was already spreading. Cases were already being reported left and right that it forced people to be on the defensive end.\nSome people woke up to the news that the virus is being spotted in various countries all over the world. The attention shifts to the World Health Organization (WHO) as they now take the lead it managing not only the spread of the virus but how to treat it. All these happened in a span of days for people that they did not have time to prepare for it.\nThe same thing can happen to your finances. You could be feeling secure in your current situation then a situation comes your way shaking everything you have built up. You can be in an industry that is experiencing a sharp decline or even a company that is sliding down. Whatever the challenges in front of you may be, it can come without a moment\u2019s notice and you can find yourself in the middle of it. Things can turn for the worse fast\nIf you are looking for financial directions from this global health issue, one is that things can go bad real quick. As soon as you start hearing about the virus, the next news that comes out is that the number of people infected starts to go up rapidly. Not only are they from the country where the virus originated but people from other countries are contracting it as well.\nYou then hear about the fatality of the virus where it now starts to take the lives of people infected. That and the fact that it is spreading all over the world can make you panic at home. You now start to wonder what the government is doing and if you and your family are safe. The virus on the other side of the world is now making you think about your own safety.\nThe same can happen with your finances. If you downplay a financial situation, it can blow up real quick. Even if you don\u2019t pay much attention to it, there are times when things accelerate at a rapid pace. One perfect example of this is missing a debt payment for a payday loan. This can put you in so much debt in just a short amount of time. You have to stay informed\nNow that you have an idea about the health scare, you need to begin being proactive about it. This is where one of the financial directions starts to come in as well. Information is very crucial when you are going through any type of situation. Take this virus for instance, you need to know the details about it to help you understand how to move forward with an action plan. It is not enough that you read about it as well. You have to discern the source of information you are consuming otherwise, it could lead to bigger problems.\nJust like the health scare, reading and keeping yourself updated with it will tell you that the fatality rate is not as high as some of the common viruses around. It will also tell you that the stronger your immune system is, the lower your chances of contracting the virus. Personal hygiene also plays a crucial role in making sure that you and your family are safe from the virus.\nThe same is true with your finances where staying informed is crucial when going through a problem. It starts with having a clear understanding of the problem at hand. It also helps if you know the available resources you have with you to help you get through problems that come your way. This can be your reserve funds or other types of savings you can rely on. Focus on the areas you have control over\nOne of the financial directions you can learn from the virus scare is that you need to focus on the areas you have control over. As a regular person, there is not much you can do in trying to develop a cure for the virus. You leave that to the doctors and medical community who are working tirelessly to study the virus and come up with a solution.\nIt would be difficult for you to try and take it upon yourself to stop incoming flights to the country. Apart from the numerous entry points, there are agencies who can do a better job at that if the time comes that there is a need to ban incoming flights from certain countries in the world. What this teaches you is that you need to focus on the areas you have control over.\nYou can focus on keeping yourself healthy and observing proper hygiene. This is important as the Atlantic shares that an average American man has a BMI that is almost obese . The same goes for your finances where you need to focus on the areas you can control. Rather than worry about the interest rate the bank might give you, work on credit score improvement. Do not worry about emergencies that could happen. Focus on strengthening your reserve funds so you can take on unforeseen challenges in your life. If you cannot make it better, do not make it worse\nOne of the biggest takeaways you learn from the virus scare is the fact that if you cannot add to the solution of the problem, the very least you can do is to not make it worse. There are people who are taking advantage of the situation to sow fear in other people and spread false information about the situation.\nWhen you apply these to your finances, it simply means that if the situation is out of your hands, the best thing you can do is prevent it from getting worse. Try and work towards a solution rather than dwelling on the problem. It will not help also if you create a negative environment by spreading lies about the situation with other people.\nThere are a lot of financial directions you can pick up from the recent virus scare and use for your own money management journey. As you look after your health, it also gives you an idea of how to move forward in certain areas of your finances.",

But despite the site\u2019s extreme anti-Semitism, homophobia, and disregard for facts, the White House gave it press credentials this past week .\nRelated: Rick Wiles claims Rachel Maddow will lead coup & decapitate Trump within hours\nWhile closing his show, Wiles said of the outbreak: \u201cSpirit bears witness that this is a genuine plague that is coming upon the earth, and God is about to purge a lot of sin off this planet.\u201d\nHe said that plagues are one of the last steps in the Last Judgment, just before war, and that China deserved to be the center of this plague because of its \u201cgodless communist government.\u201d\nAnd the U.S. isn\u2019t much better, according to Wiles.\n\u201cLook at the spiritual rebellion that is in this country, the hatred of God, the hatred of the Bible, the hatred of righteousness, the hatred of innocence,\u201d he said.\nSpecifically, this means: \u201cVile, disgusting people in this country now, transgendering little children, perverting them.

The site has also interviewed Donald Trump Jr.\nThe White House has not commented on why TruNews has been treated like a real news organization.\nIn 2014, Wiles said that an Ebola outbreak \u201ccould solve America\u2019s problems with atheism, homosexuality, sexual promiscuity, pornography, and abortion.\u201d\nWiles is also the senior pastor at Flowing Streams Church in Vero Beach, Florida.",

This exertion ought to have an effect after some time and that is the reason we accept that we'll move beyond this pandemic.\nCoronavirus 'significantly more infectious than influenza,' AstraZeneca CEO says\nIn its entire year direction for 2020, AstraZeneca said it had accepted \"a negative effect from China enduring up to a couple of months because of the ongoing novel coronavirus flare-up.\"\n\"Contingent upon the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, all out income is relied upon to increment by a high single-digit to a low twofold digit rate and center EPS is required to increment by a mid to high-teenagers rate,\" the pharma monster said in its profit report on Friday, taking note of that it would give an update its first-quarter results during the current year.\nAnalysts have just cautioned that COVID-19 might be more infectious than current information appears.\nToward the finish of January, the WHO evaluated that the R nothing of the infection was somewhere in the range of 1.4 and 2.5. A R nothing, or R0, rating of 1 methods the normal individual contaminated with the infection will spread it to one other individual.\nAn episode is required to proceed if a sickness is given a R nothing esteem higher than 1 during an occasion like the plague as of now happening in China.\nResearch distributed a month ago assessed the R nothing for COVID-19 was around 2.2, which means every patient will contaminate at any rate two individuals \u2014 that would make the coronavirus more irresistible than occasional influenza.\nThen, an exploration group at Lancaster University in England proposed in January that the coronavirus may have a R nothing of 3.1, while Chinese researchers said it could be considerably higher.\n\"We assessed the mean R0 going from 3.30 to 5.47,\" they said in a paper distributed a month ago.\nRace to build up an immunization\nSpecialists over the globe are dashing to build up an immunization for the new strain of coronavirus, officially named COVID-19, which has been announced a \"grave danger\" by the World Health Organization (WHO) and has so far tainted more than 60,000 individuals all around.\nA few pharmaceutical firms, including Vir Biotechnology, Moderna and Inovio Pharmaceuticals, have proposed they are chipping away at an immunization for the infection, which was first detailed in the Chinese city of Wuhan on December 31.\nIn spite of the worldwide exertion to build up an antibody, medicinal specialists have cautioned it could take some time for one to be cleared for open use.\nThe new strain of coronavirus produces gentle cold side effects in about 80% of patients, a WHO authority told journalists Monday. Around 15% of the individuals who contracted COVID-19 wound up with pneumonia, while 3% to 5% of all patients required serious consideration, she said.\nChina's National Health Commission on Friday announced an extra 121 passings and 5,090 new instances of COVID-19 over the territory for February 13.\nExperts in Hubei region, which is at the focal point of the emergency in China, said Friday that 51,986 individuals in the area had been contaminated with the coronavirus up until now.\n",

It's not the first time it's happened either.\nThe outbreak of novel coronavirus (nCoV) in China has ushered three P-shaped elephants into the room: three things we don't want to name. First, there's pandemic . Second, there's panic. And third, there's phobia. But the greatest of these, to misquote the Corinthians, is phobia.\nAs in xenophobia. And racism.\n\nThe Biblical reference is not for nothing. Consider how illness and healing is handled in the New Testament ... Those who had leprosy were burned in Hinnom ( Gehenna ) Valley, which an Associated Press news agency report once cited as a \"synonym for Hell.\"\nLeprosy may be 'biblical' but it's not in the past: This leprosy patient was being treated at Curupaiti colony hospital in Brazil\nBut when the sick were healed, they are brought back into the fold.\nAnecdotal vs. evidence-based research\nThe number of anecdotal reports of racism or xenophobia against Chinese people , or people who non-Chinese perceive to be Chinese, has been on the rise since the virus went global.\nAs it's anecdotal evidence, we feel it's okay to look away, with a shrug of \"We're not racist!\"\nBut that's the very problem with such irrational feelings. They are almost impossible to track if you discount anecdotal evidence. Especially as journalists, it pays to keep your eyes and ears open, rather than merely relying on carefully crafted briefs from researchers or politicians. At the same time, there is a dearth of reliable evidence. Some numbers may even mislead us.\nWatch video 01:33 Share Coronavirus empties streets Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine\nPermalink https://p.dw.com/p/3XEXw\nMore Chinese cities on lockdown as coronavirus cases soar For instance, I could tell you that there's a statistical, high probability that people from China, or those who have traveled through Asia, will have a greater risk of catching the virus than you in some quiet American suburb. And you would think, \"Hmm, makes sense.\" But without painstakingly checking a variety of data points, all you would have is a spurious logic to substantiate what we in the industry term BS.\nA U.N. report called \" Dimensions of Racism \" calls for more disaggregated evidence that includes specific information on race and ethnic groups, even though \"biologically, there is only one human race.\"\nViral on social\nFor now, you read posts on social media, where an Asian Supermarket in the German city of Cologne is at pains to make customers realize that \"We are not the virus!\" You hear stories, such as one from a colleague who just got back from my native London, where they saw passengers on public transport \"pulling their shirts up over their noses [as is if this would save them] when sitting near East Asian-looking people.\"\nOr you take a hard look at yourself, as this writer did the other day. Consequently, I'm prepared to out myself here as a racist and/or xenophobe (more on which in a moment). I was doing the weekly shop and happened to see a sack of oranges on special discount. Then I noticed they were from China, and I laughed to myself, \"I'm not touching those! Anyway, they're probably reduced to clear because of the lurgy!\"\nAt the next shop I saw two people who may or may not have been Chinese, but they looked close enough for my irrational mind, and I kept starring at them, thinking, \"Have they just flown in? Have they brought the coronavirus to my quiet neighborhood?\"\nListen to audio 30:00 Share Do I scare you?

And then I thought, \"You bl**dy fool, Zulfikar! You bl**dy racist fool!\"\nRead more: German coronavirus evacuee describes life in quarantine\nThat poor couple, out doing the weekly shop like me, must have felt so objectified and they may not have even been Chinese, or from Wuhan. Or again, like me, a half-Indian who's never been to India, they may have never visited the country of their parents or grandparents birth.\nCorkscrew of fear and loathing\nThe current case of coronavirus is a little complicated.\nTo start with we're dealing with a relatively unknown virus. Scientists don't know enough to understand how it spreads or develops, and as a result, how it can be stopped. And that sense of \"unknown unknowns,\" to misquote yet again, this time former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , is a natural breeding ground for fear, irrational feelings of distrust, disgust, hate, racism and xenophobia.\nThat U.N. report describes xenophobia as including behavior that rejects, excludes and vilifies people \"based on the perception \" that they are \"outsiders.\" Medically justified as they may be, national programs that remove and quarantine \"plane loads\" of people from Wuhan to Australia's Christmas Island or to military bases in the UK feeds into such perceptions.\nAs with the Biblical reference, Rumsfeld was not for nothing either. Rumsfeld and the George Bush Junior administration he served between 2001 and 2006 used that sense of unknown threats to leverage support for a Middle East war and an Islamophobia, encouraged with images of bearded Muslim bogeymen, which quickly transpired.\nAs far away from China as El Salvador: Thermographic imaging of air travellers\nBut then, when it comes to China, what extra leverage do people need?\nWe in the \"West\" already harbor feelings of distrust and xenophobia against the Chinese state and the people who live there \u2014 whether they're Chinese or not. We're perfectly happy to buy the iPhones they manufacture, but we sure as Hinnom don't want the Chinese firm Huawei anywhere near our 5G networks . They will spy on us, surely.\nAnd it's happened before\nThe trouble is, we often don't even realize we're doing it. Which is part of the same kind of complacency and idiocy inherent in racism itself. So, for instance, UC Berkley may have thought it was doing students a favor when the university's health center said that \"normal reactions\" to coronavirus included panic, anger, hyper-vigilance to health and \u2026 wait for it \u2026 xenophobia.\nBut is it really? Normal? I suppose if a lot of people feel that way, you could say it is kind of normal. But that doesn't make it right. UC Berkeley was accused of \"normalizing racism\" (as reported in the The Washington Post ) and apologized for the advice (my emphasis).\nOnly I would say a certain level of normalization is necessary. Without normalization, we can go on refusing to accept that racism or xenophobia, and the irrational psychological feelings that feed them, exist and need to be handled head-on.\nAfter all, we have been here before. In 2004, a year after the outbreak of SARS in Asia, researchers wrote about \" SARS-related fear, stigmatization, and discrimination .\" In an opinion piece for The New York Times , Iris Chang wrote about \" Fear of SARS, Fear of Strangers ,\" and led with a line about UC Berkeley (them again?) banning students from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore from all its summer programs.\nAnd those left behind in Wuhan ... Left to clean and rid the city of the virus\nAvoidance psychology\nBut these feelings of fear work like a corkscrew \u2014 they drill deep and risk fracturing any brittle constitution. These feelings can also endanger the perpetrators themselves.\nIn 2004, a paper about the \" psychology behind the masks \" referred to \"two diseases looming\" \u2014 one, the virus itself and two, that of a psychological nature. The authors write about \"panic-stricken people\" mobbing stores after a fake news article said Hong Kong would be sealed off from the world. Then, a man from Taiwan committed suicide in a hospital ward because he suspected family members had contracted the then-fatal virus. An evident, yet anecdotal, SARS-phobia was rearing its head. Now we have Corona-phobia.\nRead more: Countries evacuate citizens from China as coronavirus infections rise\nNone of this helps anyone. In fact, it's like the 1980s panic around HIV. The unthinking among us believed we could only get HIV if we were gay or bisexual. But as early as 1988 researchers knew that wasn't true .\nWatch video 01:07 Share Germany: Coronavirus evacuees Send Facebook Twitter google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine\nPermalink https://p.dw.com/p/3XADv\nGermany: Quarantine for coronavirus evacuees And yet this fear of \"the other\" prevails. My colleagues at Spectrum , Conor Dillon and Gabriel Borrud, have spoken to Joshua Tybur , an associate professor and psychologist at the University of Amsterdam. Tybur's looked at reactions during the 2014 Ebola outbreak and found that \"infectious disease threats make individuals worried about all kinds of people from a specific area.\" He says it's part of a \" pathogen avoidance psychology .\"\n\"It doesn't take a degree in microbiology to realize that when there's an unflushed toilet in a public restroom, or there's a pile of vomit on the floor, that's something that we don't want to touch,\" says Tybur. \"And this feeling of disgust really motivates us to avoid physical contact.\"\nIt's a good job we have nurses and doctors, who are clearly wired differently.

(Alissa Eckert, MS; Dan Higgins, MAM/CDC/) Airlines in particular were able to provide what Langille calls \"easy data\"\u2013 the names of people on a plane who may have sat near an infected person.\n\"But when somebody goes to a market, or when children that are infected go to school, for example, some of those things aren't quite as easy to track.\"\nIn the future, Langille said health providers may be able to track possible infections using RFID technology, similar to the RFID tags used in clothing to trigger security alarms.\n\"They've done a handful of studies, particularly in hospitals with medical practitioners, doctors, nurses, technicians and patients in various critical care units,\" Langille said.\n\"They'll put a tag on a practitioner, they'll put a tag on a patient and then they'll track how many interactions actually happen at close proximity, and the number is actually quite high,\" Langille said.\n\"They've done similar studies in controlled environments like high schools and universities, as well.

In addition to confirmed cases in multiple provinces in China (as of January 24, 2020 ), human-to-human infections with the virus have been confirmed in Thailand , Japan , Taiwan , South Korea , Singapore , Vietnam and USA . The total confirmed number of patients infected by 2019-nCoV is 929, with 26 deaths in Hubei Province , China .\nThe Sirnaomics R&D team has an established track record of using siRNA prophylactics and therapeutics to treat SARS coronavirus, H5N1 influenza and other respiratory viral infections, with multiple animal models including non-human primate. The team's expertise covers siRNA drug design (silencing the most critical viral genes), respiratory tract siRNA delivery formulation, large scale GMP drug production and clinical investigations. To fight against SARI caused by the 2019-nCoV infection, Sirnaomics team has already identified potentially potent siRNAs, specifically targeting the viral genes critical for the viral infection and replication. Collaborating with laboratories having cell culture models of 2019-nCoV infection, Sirnaomics expects to develop multiple siRNA drug candidates.\nPatrick Lu , PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sirnaomics, stated, \"This is a critical time for treating SARI caused by the 2019-nCoV to mitigate further spreading of the deadly disease. RNAi as a naturally evolved antiviral mechanism has been demonstrated in various in vitro and in vivo models.

Yeah, it is a little bit disgusting. They insist it is their own culture though. Even somebody can say Korea can also eat a dog. It is same. But I don't think so. Maybe eating food is culture. But eating 'raw' food is not a culture. It should be changed. There are a lot of bacteria and something harmful for human in raw animal. We can get out of them with boiling or cooking. But if you eat them in RAW, it should be very dangerous. Although it is the culture, we better stop if it is clear the culture would make us harm.

A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.\nCoronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.\ncoronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat. Most coronaviruses are not dangerous.\nSome types of coronaviruses are serious, though. About 858 people have died from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which first appeared in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and then in other countries in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Europe. In April 2014, the first American was hospitalized for MERS in Indiana and another case was reported in Florida. Both had just returned from Saudi Arabia. In May 2015, there was an outbreak of MERS in Korea, which was the largest outbreak outside of the Arabian Peninsula. In 2003, 774 people died from a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. As of 2015, there were no further reports of cases of SARS. But In early 2020, following a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization identified a new type, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\nCommon signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat. Most coronaviruses are not dangerous.\nIs travelling to China safe? Wuhan is closed to travelers. The CDC is advising that travelers avoid nonessential travel to China. Travelers who do go should: Avoid contact with sick people. Avoid animals, animal markets, and products that come from animals. Wash their hands often with soap and water, or use an alcohols based sanitizer if that\u2019s not available .

        "content": "Dr. Don Harte, noted chiropractic activist and former Libertarian State Senate candidate, is \"extremely concerned about unsubstantiated reports of flu deaths, along with lack of public health response to Chinese viral threat.\"\nDr. Harte says, \"It seems that our so-called public health officials are deliberately creating fear, and hoping for panic. They are ginning up fears of the flu, combined with a possible corona virus epidemic.\n\"I am deeply concerned about what others may be relieved about,\" Dr. Harte admits. \"Reports are coming in of corona virus vaccines being rushed to completion and then production, via new technology.\"\nDr. Harte declares, \"New technology seems exciting to some, but in Medicine, it's Russian roulette. Who knows the ramifications, both in safety and efficacy, of this totally novel vaccine for a novel virus? The regular vaccines create enough serious health problems.\"\n\"A fascinating, and scary part of this blossoming health problem is that CDC officials are saying, at least for the moment, that influenza, the flu, is a far more serious threat to Americans than the corona virus. What we have here,\" comments Dr. Harte, \"is fear from the corona virus being used, very deliberately, to increase fear of the flu virus, and, thereby, increase sales of the mostly ineffective and definitely risky flu vaccine.\"\n\"Perhaps the most serious issue,\" Dr. Harte notes, \"is the believability of the CDC. It has 'cried wolf' far too many times, and continues to do so. For years, the CDC has claimed that the flu kills 36,000 a year in this country. Last flu season, all of a sudden, they claimed 82,000.\"\n\"We can only know,\" Dr. Harte says, \"what's going on in China and around the world with the new corona virus through news reports. We all know, from personal life experience, that no one we knew ever died from the flu, while everyone we know has had the flu, many several times. Only the already very sick and feeble ever end up in the hospital. Yes, boys and girls, the CDC is lying. Their quasi-statistical trick,\" according to Dr. Harte. \"is combining flu deaths with pneumonia deaths. Take away pneumonia, and you're left with a few hundred deaths a year in a nation of 320 million. The obvious conclusion? Influenza, the flu, is not a dangerous, fatal disease.\"\nDr. Harte warns, \"When the corona vaccine comes out, watch out for an all-out fear campaign, from state, federal and international sources. If that vaccine will be as ineffective and dangerous as the flu vaccine, I wouldn't trust it.\"\n\"Finally,\" explains Dr. Harte, \"the best way to avoid the flu, the corona virus, or any infectious disease, is to get healthy. Eat well, exercise, rest appropriately, and get your nervous system free of interference by regular chiropractic care. Your nervous system runs your immune system, so take care of it! The best way to get the flu is to get a flu shot.\" Dr. Harte wonders, \"It might work the same way for the coming corona virus vaccine. So why do it?\"\nDr. Don Harte, former medical student, is a principled, traditional chiropractor serving Marin and the Greater Bay Area since 1981. He is an activist in the struggle for free speech for chiropractors. Dr. Harte was named 2006 \"Chiropractor of the Year\" by the World Chiropractic Alliance (WCA). He has served on the Boards of the WCA and the Council on Chiropractic Practice.

        "content": "US Users Targeted with Corona Virus Phishing Attacks What malware gangs are using the Corona Virus as bait. How not to fall prey to this new Corona phishing scheme. \nA new Corona Virus phishing scheme is taking the Western world by storm. Especially in the United States, but also in the UK and Western Europe or parts of Asia, hackers are using the Corona Virus scare for their own purposes. By baiting users into clicking malicious links, they steal credentials or deliver dangerous payloads of the latest malware and ransomware strains.\nIt\u2019s not a complete novelty strategy-wise, considering how phishing attacks work in general. Something that tends to alert people to the gravity and urgency of the communication will always get exploited as bait. That\u2019s why we have phishing schemes trying to impersonate government or judicial authorities, or police departments and so on.\nThis time, it\u2019s the health scare regarding the Corona Virus potentially spreading from China\u2019s Wuhan region. The Corona Virus phishing scheme is worth mentioning not just because a lot of users can be targets of it, due to the notoriety of the virus, but also because the risks involve some pretty high-profile payloads in addition to the stolen credentials. How the Main Corona Virus Phishing Schemes Work\nEspecially after the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the Corona Virus an international emergency in a statement released at the end of January, phishing campaigns using it have begun to spring up. #1. Fake CDC Alerts\nIn one such phishing campaign, first spotted by KnowBe4 and further reported by Bleeping Computer , the attackers bait the victims with a list of active infections in their surroundings. In order to access the list and see if there are any outbreaks of the virus in your vicinity, you need to click a link that redirects you to a credential-stealing page.\nThis Corona Virus phishing email imitates the ones sent by the CDC Health Alert Network. The logo and everything else inside looks consistent with the authority allegedly sending out this warning. The targets are invited to join the coordinated effort to keep the virus at bay.\nThe malicious link first seems to go to the official CDC portal but then gets rerouted towards a malicious domain used for credential phishing. That means that victims are prompted to enter their Outlook login details, which then get stolen and used for malicious purposes .\nImage source: Bleeping Computer.\nIt\u2019s remarkable that this phishing email seems very well put together, imitating the style and feel of the official CDC alerts. #2. Advice Emails from Fake Wuhan Medical Authorities\nAnother popular Corona Virus phishing campaign which also targets US and UK users is impersonating Wuhan medical specialists and claims to distribute advice for dealing with the virus. Besides listing a few common symptoms of the disease, the emails offer up an attachment with allegedly important medical advice.\nInitially spotted by Mimecast, the Corona Virus phishing campaign tries to take advantage of the panic wave created by the virus. The email recipients are prompted to download the attachment with the note \u2018This little measure can save you\u2019.\nImage source: Bleeping Computer.\nIf victims download the malicious PDF attachment, they also risk infecting their computer with a malware payload. #3. Emotet payloads\nOther Corona Virus phishing campaigns seem to have been launched by Emotet , especially in the Japan area. The mechanism of that campaign is similar: victims are tricked into clicking a malicious link in order to find out more about mandatory regulations for protection against the Corona Virus, but instead, they get delivered the Emotet payload as soon as they click the link. The banking Trojan is notoriously stealthy and difficult to remove once it enters your system.\nEmotet is surely just one of the more notorious malware strains to jump on the Corona Virus phishing bandwagon. Other malware and ransomware gangs will probably try to use genuine public fear regarding this outbreak to their advantage. Stay vigilant and don\u2019t believe every email you receive, no matter how legit it looks. How to Stay Safe from the Corona Virus Phishing Schemes\nIt doesn\u2019t take a lot to stay safe from phishing schemes in general, but this one may be a little trickier.\nGood cybersecurity habits help too, of course, so make sure you: Always inspect a link (by hovering with the mouse button over it) to see where it really leads to, especially if you received it from an out-of-the-ordinary email message or direct message; Never enter your account credentials when you are redirected to a page for downloading a file or whatever pretext the email message used; Remember that even email addresses which come from seemly legit-looking domains may not be what they seem \u2013 it\u2019s still very easy for hackers to spoof their email address into something trustworthy; Be wary of any communication that tries to make you act on impulse, by rousing strong emotions of alert, fear of missing out (you won a prize but you need to claim it now, etc.), panic and so on.\nIn addition to this general advice, you need to protect yourself from the malicious payloads that some of the emails in the Corona Virus phishing campaign carry.\nOne must-do is to keep your software up to date and apply patches as soon as they are released. Unpatched software and apps can create security loopholes you can get infected through. There are automatic tools to help with this (such as our Thor Free ).\nAnother important defense is to have an extra security layer on top of your Antivirus . Contemporary threats are getting more and more sophisticated and simple reactive software can\u2019t stand up to it anymore. That\u2019s why Antivirus is not enough .\nTo be properly protected even in the bad scenario where you click a malicious link that wants to deliver a payload in your system, you need a DNS traffic filter .\nIf you don\u2019t already use one, you can try out our Thor Premium Home (containing both an Antivirus and a DNS traffic filter and automatic software updater) for a month with this promo: The easy way to protect yourself against malware Here's 1 month of Thor Foresight Home, on the house! Use it to: Block malicious websites and servers from infecting your PC Auto-update your software and close security gaps Keep your financial and other confidential details safe EASY AND RELIABLE. WORKS WITH ANY ANTIVIRUS. Try Thor Foresight Final Thoughts\nRemember: the era in which you could easily spot a phishing email just by its bad grammar and laughable pretentions is fading. Malware actors are working more and more as organizations of highly professional individuals.\nYou need to learn to pay attention to the finer details, such as inspecting links to see where they really lead to. Also watch out for any communications which try to convey a sense of urgency, encouraging you to act now (enter credentials or call, etc.).\nEven if the claim is legitimate, there\u2019s no need to be impulsive. Check, double-check and think it through. That way malicious campaigns such as the Corona Virus phishing scheme will not fool you into any trouble. Stay safe! ",

The data was eventually taken down, but not before many pundits jumped to conclusions as to the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of remdesivir. But in response, Gilead Sciences Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey said that \"the post included inappropriate characterizations of the study.\"\nThe study in question was supposed to involve patients with mild manifestations of COVID-19. However, the trial ended early due to low enrollment. Parsey said that the data from this trial is currently being peer-reviewed, and Gilead Sciences should provide an update on it soon. Also, according to Parsey, the data from the trial was actually encouraging: \"[T]rends in the data suggest a potential benefit for remdesivir, particularly among patients treated early.\" Image Source: Getty Images.\nWhatever investors make of all this, it is essential to note that remdesivir has shown some promise. STAT, a news website that focuses on the healthcare industry , recently reported that in a sample of 125 COVID-19 patients treated at University of Chicago Medicine with remdesivir (including 113 patients with severe cases of the disease), most of them recovered and were released from the hospital, while only two died.\nHowever, that data was from only one section of a larger study, and has not yet been formally released. Until Gilead Sciences publishes full results from formal clinical trials, investors would be well-advised to take all such reports -- both positive and negative -- with a grain of salt. ",

Situated in the middle of the area known for its terrain and harsh weather, the Thunder Dragon country is simple and peaceful. Even when the world is confused in the middle of the corona virus pandemic, the people of this country still leisurely live.\nAbout two thirds of Bhutanese population follow Buddhism. Buddhism is the state religion of this country. Bhutanese devotees. They believe in the law of cause and effect. Therefore, the whole country does not slaughter animals. They eat vegetarian every day and plant trees everywhere. The law prohibits people from smoking and deforestation.\nThe peace in this place makes me believe in what Tshering Tobgay said when he was prime minister of Bhutan: \"We are not pursuing GDP. We are pursuing GNH (total national happiness)\".\nWith mostly mountainous terrain, the roads in Bhutan are mostly narrow and zigzag. There are no toll booths in the country, and no traffic lights. Highway has no street lights. However, people are still very aware and participate in orderly traffic.\nThe best time to visit is around April every year, when the apple, apricot and azalea blooms all over the hillsides. During the trip, you can also visit the monasteries, meet the monks and listen to the lecture on happiness.\nAs my predestined relationship with Rinpoche Norbu Gyeltsen, the head of the Bhutanese Buddhist Academy in Paro. His lesson teaches: \"We are happy people and should be satisfied with that. The tolerance and positive attitude will determine the fate of each person.

        "content": "When the United States 2009 H1N1 swine flu emerged, an international emergency, a declared global pandemic, it eventually infected 60 million and initially killed a minimum of 18,449 cases that year. But the final story of the H1N1 global pandemic was far worse than that, with close to 300,000 deaths, according to the final tallies in 2012 reported by the CDC, as you will read below.\nWhich is why I am scratching my head at how bizarrely negative forces are attacking China and Chinese people as it engages a remarkably aggressive front addressing this Corona virus outbreak which started in Wuhan, central China. I am forced to ask and answer a few questions.\nDuring 2009 H1N1 outbreak, I don't recall xenophobic anti-America attacks across the globe, do you? In fact, do you recall it took six months for the U.S. to declare a national emergency? Did any government from the onset in April 2009 through the end in April 2010, including the month of June, when H1N1 was declared an international emergency global pandemic, then send out a notice to its citizens that they should leave the United States? Close their borders to American travelers? Nope, not a peep.\nLike I said, something's not right, folks. I am reading hateful vicious attacks on the Chinese government for their supposed intentional conspiracy to intentionally under report the number of infections, yet that is exactly and always the case with such flu outbreaks no matter what country and the CDC reports illustrate that crystal clear. The U.S. H1N1 swine flu numbers were vastly underestimated and updated three years later, because dear friends, that is the nature of such viral outbreaks which don't care which country they started in. There is never enough man power, there are never enough test kits, there is never enough medicine or medical supplies. China is not trying to hide these hardships, they are well known, they are being reported on the news daily in China. There are always people who die, thousands of them whom we'll never know if they actually died because of a particular virus. Those are the facts, not any problem unique to China's healthcare system or government.\nIts not a conspiracy, its just tragedy.\nAccording to the June 27, 2012 research report followup three years later, it gets much more disturbing when you learn about the CDC's final estimate of the H1N1 virus global death toll. You and I find at this at this article at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy website, the CDC's 18,449 total deaths number was \"...regarded as WELL BELOW THE TRUE TOTAL, mainly because many people who die of flu-related causes are not tested for the disease.\" So during the 2009 outbreak, was anyone accusing the American medical and government authorities of hiding the numbers? Were Americans with hidden cameras strolling into the Mayo Clinic to PROVE how many people were really dying? The absurdity of these vicious attacks are that whether or not a person specifically does have the Corona virus or some other viral bug presenting as pneumonia, the treatment is the same supportive treatment anyway.\nSomething's not right here folks. The world should be applauding China's unprecedented, broad, aggressive response. (WHO officials and many other government and healthcare officials across the globe are.) I am on the ground here in China READ IT HERE watching with my own eyes and it is quite incredible by any measure, not to mention an enormous economic sacrifice.\nInstead of looking at the will of an entire system of government acting faster than any other government on the planet could, we are one month later, still busy bashing a few local government officials in Wuhan who should have told us a couple weeks sooner. And yes, that is true those local officials screwed up. And by the way, those officials are in deep trouble for it. Just like the recent Puerto Rican politicians who are in trouble when we learned they didn't distribute hurricane emergency supplies that were sent to them to help during last year's terrible hurricane. A disgrace. Individual people screw up all the time and hopefully justice gets served later, but that's not an indictment of an entire country's government. Secondly, on this point, every provincial government has sent out a notice to its government officials pretty much saying that if they are stupid enough to do the same, they will face the wrath of harsh punishment. I don't doubt it for a moment. Lets contrast to what countless western politicians have gotten away with and remain in office to remind all of us that human error, stupidity and greed is not unique to any particular skin color or race or country. \"What about...\" reactions don't help.\nAnd here's the mic drop for you: \"The CDC researchers estimate that the H1N1 2009 pandemic virus caused 201,200 respiratory deaths and another 83,300 deaths from cardiovascular disease associated with H1N1 infections.\" Total: 284,000 deaths. Shocking, isn't it?\nWas there a travel ban for any length of time to and from the United States?\nDid China, Germany, Japan or any other country close their border to American travelers?\nToday I noticed in the updates that following the United States Department of State policy suggesting U.S. citizens leave China, the United Kingdom embassy just released the same recommendation to subjects of the kingdom.\nIn 2009, did UK subjects in America get a notice from their kingdom to leave America? No.\nDid the world suggest we isolate from America? Close the U.S. borders!? No.\nDid Americans get xenophobically attacked and targeted by anti-American sentiments like the Chinese are experiencing now? Um, no.\nFascinating and disturbing to say the least. If you're an expat currently in China, unless you're in Wuhan, fact is that you're most likely safer and more peaceful and more stable by simply staying put than by leaving right now. You couldn't be safer than in this country, where almost everyone is staying home and dutifully isolating themselves with awareness. Not to mention that the Chinese government's decision to safeguard the society, the families, the people, is coming at a devastating economic cost in the hundreds of billions.\nI have a friend in Mesa, Arizona. He told me earlier that the big popular China City buffet, a huge busy place, has no customers. Does that make any sense at all?\nLet's test our ability to reason, to be rational:\nIf you were in Miami and you heard that there was a virus outbreak that started in Milan, in central Italy, would you cancel your dinner reservation at the Italian restaurant that night in South Beach? No. Would you buy a pizza next week at Joey's Pizzeria in Delray Beach?\nIf you were in Singapore and you heard there was a virus outbreak in Dallas, Texas in the central United States, would you stop going to your favorite local Texas southern BBQ restaurant with the owner from Houston, in Singapore?\nWould you avoid olive-skinned dark-haired Italian-looking people on the street in Chicago? Would you avoid big guys wearing cowboy hats, cuz they're obviously from Texas in Singapore cuz there's a virus in Dallas and they might have just gotten off the plane? There's a strange senseless bullying extremism and activism in today's society and you should do your best to avoid it and not be a part of it. It is fomented by a small group of extremist activists while definitely not supported by your average mainstream person who is simply exhausted by their outrage-inducing antics.\nFinally, here are some straight up, sensible accurate descriptions of this Corona virus which started in Wuhan, China. Its not called the China virus and neither was H1N1 called the America virus. Whether two weeks or two months from now, this flu season type virus will have passed and the joy of Spring will have arrived. Just like every flu season. However, don't misunderstand me. The extra caution and the remarkable response by the Chinese governments and people together to quell the spread of this virus was warranted because, yes it is correct that this corona virus is nastier than the usual annual flu bug, as was H1N1 in 2009. As of now, what we can confidently note the following regarding this Corona virus:\nThis Corona virus is highly contagious, it spreads quite easily. It binds to lung tissue and so in particular, likes to cause pneumonia, that's what infection of lung tissue is. That's more severe than a respiratory infection which is only in your throat or bronchial tubes.\nThe Corona virus currently has a 2% death rate. That's a lot higher, around 20x higher, than a more typical annual flu virus with a death rate of 0.1%. However, a 2% death rate is still much lower by comparison to the SARS virus which had a 9% death rate or the MERS virus with a really nasty 37% death rate.\nThe Corona virus is causing severe symptoms in 10-15% of cases. 80% to 90% of deaths from this virus are happening in elderly patients, mostly with other existing health problems, not younger people. That characteristic by the way, is in contrast to the America 2009 H1N1 swine flu virus which in fact had a higher death rate amongst younger people including children rather than those over 60 years old.\nChina identified and shared the Corona virus genome in record times, in only days and of course, immediately shared it with all international health and disease organizations. Medical researchers are already discovering that certain existing anti-viral medications seem to be effective against this Corona virus.\nIts impossible not to marvel at China's broad and aggressive domestic response directed by the provincial level governments to restrict movement, restrict transportation, restrict business for a period of time combined with the voluntary dutiful cooperation of its 1.3 billion citizens who are in the majority quietly staying at home these weeks to let the virus pass; this model response is already being hailed by the international community as a remarkable unprecedented response setting a new standard in understanding what is possible for future outbreaks in whatever country they may occur. Is it inconvenient and costly. You bet.\nLike I said, something's not right with the way humanity is responding to what's happening here. I haven't put my finger on it because well, its certainly complex and the world is upside down in many other ways that I also can't for the life of me understand or explain without ending up writing a very thick book.\nBut I do know this: It needs to stop. This vicious, political, xenophobic racist attacks and smearing of all things China needs to stop. Its really not helping anyone in the political corridors of Washington nor is it doing anything to help the man on the street who is just concerned with taking care of his family.\nMy family is originally from the Basilicata region of Italy, the little hillside Italian towns of Potenza and also, Grottola, which is just outside of Matera. They left their home country and moved to America where I was born, in Yonkers, New York. America became their home and it was my home until I left, too. Now over two decades ago, I left the United States, the country I was born in, the country that has plenty to admire and plenty to improve. But I left and I came to China and now China is my home. If you had asked me thirty years ago if this was my life plan on planet earth, I would have said you were nuts or a really bad fortune teller. But that's how it has turned out. I am truly blessed with my lovely Chinese wife and our family living here in Shenyang in China's northeast. You get my meaning? I am a mature adult like many with the powers of observation. I can easily see that whether we are talking about China or the United States or any other country, their societies and their governments have good points and bad points.\nThe xenophobia needs to stop now. Whether in a couple of weeks or months later, this nasty flu type Corona virus will begin declining and the joy of Spring will arrive. Between now and then if you don't have anything good, anything supportive to say about China or Chinese people, how about you just keep your mouth shut.\nMario Cavolo, Shenyang.\nSource : Linkedin\nCheck out Mario's YouTube channel with lots of cool videos: The Dragon Roars On\nCheck out Mario's books on Amazon And visit Mario on Facebook\nPublished By\nMario Cavolo Author, Speaker, Artist, Entreneurneur Something's Not Right Folks\" In this article, Mario takes the time to compare the situations between America's 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak and the current China Corona virus outbreak.

Coronavirus cases in the UK: confirmed, suspected, and death toll\nThe UK reported a total of nine confirmed novel coronavirus cases among the 1,114 suspected people tested as of 16 February, including 57 in Scotland. No deaths have been reported, however.\nThe patients are isolated at designated hospitals for treatment and observation. Coronavirus measures by the UK government Evacuations from Wuhan\nThe UK government has started evacuating its citizens from Wuhan in special planes.\nA batch of 118 evacuees reached the UK on 09 February and is isolated at a 300-bed accommodation facility at Kents Hill Park in Milton Keynes for 14 days, which is the incubation period for the nCoV. Measures taken by airports and airlines against the Covid-19\nThe UK\u2019s flag carrier British Airways began preventive measures by cancelling direct flights to and from China. British private airline Virgin Atlantic too announced similar measures and is offering full refund for bookings made for future dates and partial refund if the travel has already commenced.\nScreening for the nCoV infection is in place at all major airports. Medical staff are deployed at all airports and public health experts team is made available in Heathrow. Coronavirus diagnosis in the UK\nPublic Health England (PHE) rolled out the novel coronavirus diagnostic test it has developed to laboratories across the nation on 10 February. A laboratory request form E28 for coronavirus testing has been provided to the citizens.\nLondon currently has one laboratory where the diagnostic test can be performed, while PHE aims to increase the number of labs with the test being available to 12 in the upcoming weeks.\nLaboratories at Cambridge, Bristol and Manchester are performing coroanvirus testing, while Scotland has two laboratories, one each in Edinburgh and Glasgow.\nOne laboratory each is planned in Northern Ireland, Wales, London, Birmingham, Leeds, Newcastle, and Southampton.\nPHE\u2019s laboratories in Colindale are performing confirmatory tests. Travel advice to the British in the wake of coronavirus\nThe UK has advised travellers that returned from nine countries 14 days prior to beginning the quarantining to not come out of their homes during the incubation period and avoid contact with other people.\nSuch travellers have also been advised to inform the National Health Service (NHS) of their recent travel to that country. The list of countries includes China, Thailand , Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, and Macau.\nThe UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advised against travelling to Hubei province during the outbreak and against all but essential travel to China.\nThe UK also advised against all but essential travel to provinces on the Thailand-Malaysia border, such as Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat, and Southern Songkhla.

Coronavirus vaccine development efforts by the UK\nThe UK announced a \u00a320m ($26m) donation to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to support the development of coronavirus vaccines .\nScientists at Imperial College London are testing a nCoV vaccine on animals. Impact of the Wuhan coronavirus on the UK economy and businesses\nUK companies either exporting to China or having significant Chinese operations are expected to be affected by the coronavirus outbreak.\nChina accounted for 9.4% of total goods imports from the UK in November 2019. China is also among the five biggest markets for UK\u2019s imports. UK companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak\nA number of British companies are being affected either directly or indirectly due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, some of which are listed below.\nProduction at Chinese facilities of Volex, a cable assemblies supplier based in the UK, has been hit due to extended closure of manufacturing plants. Three of the company\u2019s four plants in China are yet to resume production as of 10 February, while one plant is operational, although at a reduced capacity.\nUK-based global luxury brand Burberry Group has expressed concerns over sales dipping in Mainland China and Hong Kong due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The company has closed 24 of its 64 stores in Mainland China, while other stores too are operational for limited hours.\nBurberry\u2019s Asia Pacific sales witnessed a low single-digit percentage growth, which was driven by Chinese mid-teens. Significant fall in footfalls in Mainland China stores are foreseen to have a negative impact on its Asia Pacific sales in the short-term.\nBurberry\u2019s sales in Hong Kong halved during the last reported quarter and are only expected to fall further due to the border closures in Hong Kong. Government advises to retain medical supplies stock\nThe UK government currently sees no shortages in medical supplies but has advised companies to retain the existing stock of medical supplies. It was a contingency measure in the Brexit context. Coronavirus impact on oil prices and demand: BP sees a definitive impact\nThe oil prices have fallen by approximately 17% due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak (Covid-19), since they peaked in January 2020.\nBritish Petroleum (BP) opined that the global oil consumption could see a 0.5% decline due to lower demand resulting from the coronavirus outbreak, based on initial estimates. The company expects the consumption to fall by up to 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) and foresees supply cuts by oil companies in the short-term.\nFurther price correction could occur if the outbreak continues to affect logistics and travel.\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) too has announced that oil demand will be reduced due to the coronavirus impact.

Erram January 23,2020 - 05:04 PM\nWorkers spray disinfectant at a train station in Wuhan in southern China\u2019s Hubei province, Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2020. Chinese health authorities urged people in the city of Wuhan to avoid crowds and public gatherings, after warning on Wednesday that a new viral illness that has infected hundreds and caused at least nine deaths could spread further. | Chinatopix via AP CEBU CITY, Philippines \u2014 The Department of Transportation (DOTr) has issued an advisory encouraging all transportation hubs in the country to be vigilant on the threat of the new coronavirus strain from China. In a press release issued today, Thursday (January 23), DOTr quoted its head, Secretary Arthur Tugade, encouraging all airports and seaports to observe vigilance to prevent possible entry and spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus, simplified as 2019 nCoV, especially in anticipation of the influx of passengers this Lunar New Year on January 25.\nRead more: DOH-7: Boy from Wuhan continues to test negative of non-specific coronavirus The country\u2019s transportation bureau stated that they have been closely monitoring all airports in the country, particularly Kalibo International Airport which served as a gateway for airline companies serving direct flights from the country to Wuhan City.\nThe 2019 nCoV, also known as the Wuhan coronavirus, originated in Wuhan City in Hubei Province of Central China which had already spread to other countries such as Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and the United Stated.\nRead more: DOH-7 sends more doctors, nurses to T2 of Mactan-Cebu International Airport DOTr also said that an airline was planning to suspend its direct flights to Wuhan City from Kalibo International Airport in Aklan province and vice-versa. \u201cCivil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) Director General Jim Sydiongco adds that Royal Air, one of the airlines that operate direct flights between Kalibo and Wuhan, has manifested its intention to suspend its Wuhan flights until the coronavirus issue has been contained and managed,\u201d it added.\nRead more: China\u2019s appeal: Report suspected cases of coronavirus infection On the maritime side, DOTr announced that all ports in the country are instructed to implement \u2018strict passenger screening\u2019 at arrivals.

        "content": "The rapid rise in COVID-19 cases across the country coupled with a shortage of protective gear for the medical community and relief workers has created a small boom on the supply side \u2013 unfortunately not always with great results. The biggest shortage is of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits and high quality masks (commonly known as N95 mask that 3M makes). While existing manufacturers have ramped up production to meet demand, a set of new manufacturers have jumped in to help mitigate shortage. The problem is with the cottage industries that have sprung up by slapping togther various components such as gloves, foot covers, eyeglasses while the protective suit itself is stiched in strange shapes and material. Since these are offered at prices as low at Rs350 plus, we are also seeing a rush among well-intentioned donors, who do not seem to be checking for certification and quality \u2013 especially when they are being supplied to hospitals for use by medical profesisonals The poor quality PPE suits are also coming in from China. According to a report 170,000 PPE kits that arrived in India on April 5, about 50,000 failed quality tests. Fortunately, the Union Health Ministry however has issued specific guidelines to stipulate which materials constitute a PPE. These include items like Head Gear, Goggles, Face-Shield, Mask, Gloves, Gown and Shoe-cover made from specified materials. In order to fight this issue of \u201cfake\u201d PPEs, Maharashtra had recently announced that PPE kits and N-95 masks made by private firms cannot be sold unless certified by the state-run Haffkine Biopharmaceuticals Corporation. While the state has justified this as a means to check the quality of masks and other essentials, manufacturers, hospitals as well as donor organisations lost a precious week over the confusion caused and the process. The Mumbai municipal corporation has now taken charge of quality checks and approving what goes out to hospitals, says a doctor from one of Mumbai\u2019s leading government hospitals who is deeply involved in coordinating supplies for the hospital. He says, on one particular day, 63 samples were submitted and more than half were rejected. Meanwhile high quality products are indeed available, but the price of PPEs has been as high as Rs 1500 to Rs 2500, while the asking rate for N95 masks was anywhere from Rs 210 for bulk orders to Rs 395 at the retail level. Moneylife Foundation, which has been donating N 95 masks had also purchased them as high as Rs175, before being able to connect with Venus Safety and Health, a Taloja based company that has been producing a wide range of masks and other medical safety equipment of high quality. Venus is now hugely over-booked with large chunks of its production being cranked out for government hospitals, but has been selling at less than a third the price of our initial purchase. Interestingly, sources connected with the company point out that they are finally getting due recognition for their products and quality. Until recently, when cheap imports from China were available in plenty, neither doctors nor hospitals wanted to pay attention to a local manufacturer, even though their products were equally good. Moneylife Foundation had a similar experience with Paras Trading Corporation which is being run by the Jhaveri family, operating out of TTC Industrial area at Pawne, Navi Mumbai. We zeroed in on it as one of the first PPE manufacturers to be cleared by Haffkine and one that was offering fair price and quick delivery. Since our supplies are for medical professionals there was always a concern about quality, given the range of safety equipment being bombarded by a wide spectrum of suppliers \u2013 from the most dubious to very expensive. In the circumstances, it was gratifying for us to receive a call from a leading Mumbai hospital to say they were very happy with the products supplied and wanted to contact the company to place a direct order. The foundation\u2019s experience with protective face shields for medical professionals has been equally onerous. In late March and early April, when the need for protective gear as well as shortages were at their peak, we have bought face shields at as much as Rs175 plus GST. As more manufacturers jumped into the fray and began 3-D printing of faceshields, prices have dropped to a third. And even less for really big bulk purchases. The Corona pandemic has truly been a big boom opportunity for some business and many have not hesitated to take full advantage of the panic and the shortages. Sadly enough, this is at the cost of donor organisations that have garnered public funds to help protect our medical warriors. But it is now time to step back and take stock \u2013in the week of April 20, the larger government hospitals as well as designated COVID hospitals, we learn, have finally begun to receive government and supplies of protective gear. It may not meet 100% of what medical workers and doctors would want, but the acute shortage and panic has eased. However, the situation remains dire for smaller, peripheral hospitals including maternity hospitals are in danger of becoming the next hot spot, since patients affected by community spread of the virus walk in there.",

Ethiopian was one of the few international airlines to launch flight to China in 1972. The airline on average transports 4,000 Chinese between China and Africa daily. Ethiopian serves Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Chengdu. Prior to the outbreak it had announced that it was planning to add three more destinations to China.\nEthiopian Airlines Group CEO Tewolde Gebremariam told The Reporter that his airline seconds the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) statement that states that isolating China is not a solution for the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cAs WHO clearly stated that suspending flights to China would not end the coronavirus outbreak as victims of the virus are located in other countries,\u201d Tewolde said.\nSeventy percent of the Chinese passengers arriving Addis Ababa Bole International Airport transit to other African countries.\nTewolde said that the suspension of Ethiopian flights to China does not guarantee that the virus will not spread to Ethiopia. \u201cEven if Ethiopian suspends flights to China other airlines would bring passengers to Ethiopia. Secondly, through Star Alliance, code share and interline agreements Ethiopian will transport passengers originating from China. We fly to Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Japan and Korea. So we will transport passengers transiting in these countries,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if we stop flying to China, still, Chinese airlines can bring and feed us passengers in those countries. We daily fly to Bangkok. Thai Airways flies to China. If we stop flying to China, still, Thai would bring to us passengers from China,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe should not isolate China. We should not marginalize Chinese passengers. What we should do is screen passengers in accordance with the WHO guidelines,\u201d he added.\nBritish Airways has suspended flights to China but Chinese airlines are flying to the UK. Middle East carriers has scaled down their operations to China. Emirates suspended flights to Shanghai and Guangzhou but continues flying to Beijing. Major Chinese carriers like China Southern which operates more than 800 aircraft, Air China and China Eastern fly to the US, Europe and Asia.\n\u201cIf we stop flying to China we can still bring passengers from Korea, the Philippines, Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand and that originated from China. So the most important thing is to strengthen the passenger screening mechanism and follow the WHO procedures,\u201d Tewolde said. He also underlined the need to ensure the wellbeing of the staff of the airline. \u201cWe need to avail proper protective materials. We have to protect our flight crew and all other our colleagues, our passengers and our people,\u201d he said.\nAccording to Tewolde, Ethiopian is not an airline that flies to countries only at good times. \u201cEthiopian Airlines serves countries in good and bad times. When Ebola outbreak hits African countries we were there. During the civil war in Angola 30 years ago we used to fly to Luanda amidst exchange of fire near the airport. Because they are our brothers and sisters we have to stand by them. China has a strong trade and investment relationship with Africa. And Ethiopian Airlines is the major carrier that links China with many African countries. If we stops flights to China we break that relationship,\u201d he said.\nSince the Ministry of Health began the flight screening at Addis Ababa Airport 1,500 Chinese passengers entered Ethiopia while 2,000 Chinese passengers transit to other African countries daily.\nTewolde said that Ethiopian Airlines is closely working with the Ministry of Health and the Ethiopian Public Health Institute.\nAsked why Ethiopian Airlines did not suspend flights to China, the Director General of the Ethiopian Public Health Institute Doctor Eba Abate said that the coronavirus cases reported in the five cities that Ethiopian fly to is minimal. Eba said the institute has tightened the passenger screening at the Addis Ababa Airport and 27 checkpoints.\nBody temperature of 47,167 passengers have been checked out of which 1,607 were from countries which reported cases of coronavirus. According to Dr. Eba, the institute is in the process to import the detergent used to test coronavirus.\nThe WHO has deplored the decision made by some countries to suspend flights to China saying that the action violets the International Health Regulation (IHR2005).\nIn a related news, the WHO this week announced that the launch of a 675 million fund to combat the spread of coronavirus.\nTo fight further spread of the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in China and globally, and protect states with weaker health systems, the international community has launched a USD 675 million preparedness and response plan covering the months of February through to April 2020.\n\u201cMy biggest worry is that there are countries today who do not have the systems in place to detect people who have contracted with the virus, even if it were to emerge,\u201d said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (PhD), WHO Director-General. \u201cUrgent support is needed to bolster weak health systems to detect, diagnose and care for people with the virus, to prevent further human to human transmission and protect health workers.\u201d\nGate and Melinda Foundation pledged to support 100 million USD for the fight against the pandemic.",

I would blame it on the lack of hygiene awareness among the Chinese, which I dare say is one big problem. Although some workers have returned to work since last Friday, many companies are observing the flexible working hours or have their employees working from home. The banks open two or three days a week for counter-related or self-serving machine services. Schools and educational institutions remain closed. A majority are still in \u201cself quarantine\u201d as part of the precautionary measures against the spread of the virus. This quarantine would not have happened if the people practise good hygiene. The SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak 17 years ago that claimed hundreds of lives has not changed their bad habits. Spitting is one bad habit of the Chinese that annoys me the most, not just the disgusting mucus on the floor but also the loud irritating throat-clearing sound. I have always wondered why must they \u201ctell the whole world\u201d in doing so. If you happen to be in Beijing, check out the streets, especially the entrance or exit of subway stations, and you will see patches of dark spots. I can bet these are dried mucus already mixed with dust and dirt. Coughing or sneezing without covering one\u2019s mouth is common in public areas and restaurants, and all these bad habits contributed to the spread of the virus.",

It is a family of viruses that includes SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), so called because of the spikes on the surface of the virus, which seems to form a corona or crown. The current novel coronavirus that originated from Wuhan, China is a new strain.\n2| Is coronavirus deadly? The currently spreading novel coronavirus is highly infectious and has killed 170 people as of this writing. Yes, it is deadly.\n3| Where does coronavirus come from?\nNot from Corona or beer. Scientists think the novel coronavirus is a strain that jumped from snakes to humans, according to a study published in the Journal of Medical Virology . The virus has since mutated to be able to pass from human to human through coughing and sneezing.\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\n4| Where does Corona Beer come from? Corona is produced in Mexico and is the top-selling imported beer in the United States. In the Philippines, Corona is available in groceries and convenience stores nationwide.",

        "content": "Coronaviruses (CoV) are a family of zoonotic viruses (transmitted between animals and humans) which cause illnesses including common cold and other severe diseases. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) was transmitted from dromedary camels to humans while the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) was a coronavirus transmitted from civet cats to humans. The novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain of CoV which has previously not been identified in humans. The animal origin of the 2019-nCoV has been suggested to be snakes (According to Ji et al 2019 PMID: 31967321). However, the study methods in this paper is being debated by scientists.\n2019-nCoV linked illness was first reported in December, 2019, in Wuhan City, the Capital of Hubei Province, Central China.\nSigns and symptoms of 2019-nCoV: Common signs include fever, cough, shortness of breath and respiratory difficulties. In severe cases, the infection may lead to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and possibly death.\n2019-nCoV updates from Researchers: Researchers at Wuhan Institute of Virology, led by Virologist Zheng Li-Shi isolated and cultured the virus and discovered that 2019-nCoV uses the same molecular receptor, ACE2 as the SARS-CoV (As seen in Zhou et al, 2020 https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.914952v2 ). Scientists at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, Australia were able to culture the virus and grow it for the first time in a lab outside China. This progress announced on January 29th is a promising update, as it will facilitate further testing and development of vaccines. In addition, labs in France, Germany and Hong Kong are also isolating and preparing samples of the virus (from local patients). These labs will eventually share the virus samples with labs around the world, hence labs across the globe will be able to begin/continue researching the 2019-nCoV.\nCurrent updates from public health agencies: As at 2nd February, 2020, the WHO reports that 14,557 2019-nCoV cases have been confimed globally, with 2604 new cases. In China, there are 14411 confirmed cases (2590 new), 2110 severe cases (315 new) and 304 deaths (45 new). Outside China, there are 146 confirmed cases in 23 countries (See global distribution maps below), and 1 confirmed death outside China (in the Phillipines). According to WHO Risk assessment, China is currently at very high risk, with the regional and global risks being high. Specifically in Canada, there are 4 confirmed 2019-nCoV cases. Coronavirus Global mapPhoto Credit: WHO situation report (02/02/2020)\nStandard Recommendations to prevent spread of infection: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), regular hand washing and cleaning using alcohol-based hand run or soap and water, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, cooking meat and eggs thoroughly, as well as avoiding close contact with people demonstrating respiratory symptoms (such as coughing and sneezing). More recommendations for people travelling, or in contact with people who have recently traveled apply and can be found on the WHO emergency website ",

This new strain of coronavirus is currently linked to nearly thirty thousand infections and rising fatalities in China, and additional cases have been brought to other areas of the world. by air travelers.\nHere\u2019s our perspective:\nIs it worse than SARS? That\u2019s hard to say. Younger people may be more resilient, but a reported 25-30% of cases require intensive care. In truth, we don\u2019t know because we don\u2019t have the denominators (number of infected, number recovering), we only have the available daily updates on the situation that are available here .\nIsn\u2019t it just like the common cold? That would be nice, but, no. Our analysis of the conservation of T cell epitopes found in currently circulating strains of influenza with 2019 n-COV shows poor conservation with circulating \u201cCommon cold\u201d (corona) viruses (at left) and against other coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, etc) at right. Basically, there is no T cell epitope cross-conservation (or very limited conservation) with other viruses according to EpiCC, our tool for evaluating outbreak strains. That\u2019s why this virus is going to be far worse than the common cold or the flu. (For medical updates see here ).\nCan you make a vaccine for it? Yes we can . We\u2019ve been building the tools to design \u201c Vaccines on Demand \u201c for 20 years. And, because nCOV is an RNA virus, it has the opportunity to \u2018 go stealth \u2018 due to the mutability of its genome, making designing a vaccine for it a bit more difficult. But we are working swiftly, under the direction of EpiVax Vaccine Director, Dr. Lenny Moise , to develop a computational plan of attack. Important to note \u2013 it has human-like sequences that may abrogate immune response . Like HIV. Like HCV. Like influenza. ",

Let\u2019s say that the virus, which has caused concern with the number of cases exceeding 6 thousand, is seen in 13 countries . Despite all efforts, there is currently no cure for the Corona epidemic that continues to spread. Doctors prescribe Coro pain relief and antipyretic drugs to treat symptoms. Doctors say that the room humidifier and hot shower will be good for sore throat and cough. People who get sick need to drink plenty of fluids, rest and sleep as much as possible. It is stated that the symptoms of Corona virus are runny nose, cough, sore throat, headache and fever that lasts for several days.",

        "content": "It took me a few days to decide whether or not I want to write these articles. When I first mentioned it to my parents, they were crying out loud and asked one of my best friends to talk me out of it. Minutes after I published my first article, I saw visitors to my blog from \u201cunknown region\u201d and I got a text from my phone sending me a code to reset my Microsoft account password, which I did not ask for. I am not here to defame the Chinese government or promote any conspiracy theories. I am here to raise awareness about this outbreak, in the hope that Chinese people in China will receive foreign aids and people outside of China can do more to protect themselves.\nThere were several reasons as to why there was a delay in officially announcing the outbreak. First, the Chinese official thought that they would be able to contain the virus without causing widespread panic. Second, it was the Lunar New Year, the period where the economy would be the strongest, and lastly, you can understand that by watching HBO\u2019s miniseries Chernobyl. Wuhan received the announcement to quarantine the city right before the eve of Lunar New Year. In other words, economy was the last thing in mind at that point. I saw a segment in CTV news the other day, the Canadian official was saying that he was worry about the economic impact that the outbreak would bring! And today, there was an organized event in Chinatown trying to boost people\u2019s confidence and encourage them to celebrate the Lunar New Year as it should be! As a Chinese, I really appreciate politicians for talking about not to discriminate our community. However, it's foolish to play Princess Diana now by intentionally hugging people and not wearing mask. It's still flu season!\nThis flu season so far, 13 million Americans have contracted the flu and 6600 people have died from complications of the flu virus. It\u2019s the deadliest in 40 years. As of today, the number of confirmed cases of the corona virus is 14,411, suspected cases 19,544 and 328 died. If the corona virus is less than a flu in fatality rate, why would China quarantine a city of 10 million people right before lunar new year? And as of now, 50 million people in the Hubei province are under lockdown. One major difference between the flu virus and the corona virus is that the flu virus is a DNA virus and Corona is a RNA virus. In short, a RNA virus is much more likely to mutate and it will keep on changing to adapt to their living environment, the human body. In fact, the confirmed cases of corona virus has already surpassed the total number of 8000 SARS patients in 2003. It took SARS almost half a year to reach 8000.\nHow was the official confirmed number and fatality number determined? Because this is also flu season, it\u2019s hard to determine whether a person has corona or the flu. In order to confirm, their specimen has to be tested, or undergoing a CT scan to see any abnormalities in their lung. Who are \u201celigible\u201d to receive the test kit and go under further exam? Only the ones who have been hospitalized because their condition is critical. It\u2019s not hard to find videos on Youtube that show you how crowded the hospitals are in Wuhan, how many people are unable to be admitted, how many suspected cases have walked out of the hospital to potentially infect more people and how many cannot even make it to the hospital. Majority of the infected cases are not accounted for because their symptoms are mild or they are already dead, not to mention people who are still in incubation period.\nOne way to get near the actual number is to look at the percentage of infected cases among Japanese citizens evacuated out of Wuhan. There were 206 people that came out of Wuhan. At this time 20 of them have shown flu-like symptoms and 3 confirmed cases. These Japanese citizens are unlike locals. They might not have been to every corner of the city. One conservative estimate says that over 100,000 people in Wuhan have contracted the virus plus the number of people in incubation period. There are other sources that estimate the actual fatality rate by looking into how busy the crematories are. For people who died without being a confirmed case, the cause of death is contributed to \u201cpneumonia\u201d.\nOne reliable aspect of the official stat is the number of people who have recovered. It\u2019s 304 as of now. They have recovered because 1)they have a strong immune system to start with, 2) some have been given medications for HIV or Ebola, 3) some allegedly took Chinese herbs to boost their immunity, 4) a few was hooked on an artificial lung to help them breath while giving their lung a chance to recover. In general, the most effective treatment is the strength of their immunity, which can make this virus very deadly to the ones who have a weak immune system. We know that the first confirmed case in Toronto has just been discharged from the hospital. So far, there has not been any fatality case in countries outside of China. It could be due to the fact that they have received the best treatment and care possible, which is a luxury for people in Wuhan and the rest of China.\nHere is an article by Dr. Jane Orient , the executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons , title: The Corona Virus \u2013 1918 all over again? This is one of the few warnings I read from a mainstream source. She concluded the article by saying:\n\"Panic is never helpful; staying calm is always good advice. But failure to heed previous warnings of the need for robust disaster planning, and complacency about medical technology and governmental resources, has set the stage for potential unprecedented disaster. Individuals need to recognize that they themselves, and not 911 or the emergency room or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, may hold the key to their family\u2019s and their community\u2019s survival. Local authorities need to know that they may be on their own. For now, stock up on supplies; cover those coughs and sneezes; wash hands frequently for at least 20 seconds; avoid crowds; and stay aware, as the situation could change rapidly.\u201d\nIn this post, I talk about the quarantine, what life is like inside Wuhan and for people who left Wuhan: Worse than the Virus",

Simon is not correct, nor are you Adam, because I used the same method that Simon described.\u201cThe correct mortality rate is number of dead people divided by the number of infected people on the day the (soon to be) dead got infected.\u201d\nThe question here is \u201care the input numbers essentially correct\u201d\u2013 and nobody knows for certain- and it\u2019s a moving target.\nAlso, better or worse health care will result in lower or higher mortality rates. This is also a function of the number of those infected \u2013 a health care system can be overwhelmed by larger numbers of patients \u2013 there are a limited number of ICU beds \u2013 consider this real-life example, written by a medical colleague about a recently-averted disaster:\n\u201cThe possible implications of a major sour gas leak from the Mazeppa plant are almost beyond comprehension. I was one of the first people Allan consulted about Mazeppa, and it took courage for him to \u2018run with the ball\u2019 on this subject, as there are potentially angry parties who obviously took a loss by being forced to do the right thing when MacRae rang the bell. It is well documented elsewhere in this package exactly what transpired, but I can elaborate as a medical specialist, and former army officer trained in NBCW (Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Warfare) a worst case scenario. Imagine a large leak of gas with the approximately 40% hydrogen sulfide present at Mazeppa, and a wind drifting it into SE Calgary. The gradual buildup of gas in the suburbs would desensitize the nose, and concentrations could then rise without alarming anyone. Tiny fractions of one percent concentration would make whole swaths of the city critically ill with respiratory failure. As it approached anywhere near a tenth of a percent strength\u2026 fatalities everywhere. And the thousands of critically ill survivors could not be managed in our city with only about a hundred ICU beds. It could be a wartime scenario, with potential casualty tolls like the worst firestorms from WW II bombing of Tokyo or Dresden. It would make the SARS epidemic look like an inconvenience. I\u2019m not being melodramatic; this is an entirely plausible worst-case scenario.\u201d David A February 3, 2020 at 5:09 pm\nAllan, where did you get information on when the dead got infected. ( I see the link now) Many reports out of China say people are dying in line to get in. Many simply went home. Children under 12, now age 18 are not accepted. Test kits are very short, and many deaths are assigned to Viral pemonuia. All the hospitals in Wuton were overwhelmed when there was less then 1000 cases. ( Not likely)\nSo let\u2019s say 2 percent is about 20 times the flu death. If it is 4 percent then the 80 k that died in the US two years ago would turn into 3.2 million.\nChina has many reasons to understate their numbers. ",

        "content": "Basically, man created God as a perfect creature. That perfection, manifested in the form of reason. Not all beings have it.\nNevertheless, man is not without blemish. It has weak edges. Biological poverty, the world historian, Yuval Noah Harari called it.\nThere are at least two biological theft that become an ancient threat to the long history of mankind. As outlined in his proposal in the Masterpiecenya, Homo Deus: The Future of mankind, the theft of the famine and the plague of illness.\nThe Corona Virus that is currently engulfed in China and a number of countries, is nothing but a tangible manifestation of our biological theft. It is vulnerable to epidemic diseases. Loading...\nHistory has recorded how man fights from time to time with crippling bacteria and viruses, even eradicating, human species. In 1330, for example, there erupted a tragedy known as the Black Death. The tragedy caused by the bacteria that ride on Yersenia\u2019s head lice, struck east or central Asia, then to Europe, North Africa to the coastal areas of the Atlantic Ocean.\nThere were 75 million to 200 million people died of the bacteria. The number, equivalent to a quarter of the European and Asian populations at the time. In the UK itself recorded 4 out of 10 people who died from the illness. Britain\u2019s population dropped drastically, from 3.7 million before the outbreak to 2.2 million after.\nIn 1520, there was a terror explosion returning from a more terrifying new epidemic. Chickenpox alias smallpox his name. An African slave named Fransisco de Egula who was brought by the Spanish army to Mexico who brought his virus.\nFrancisco chills to arrive in Cempoallan city. He also died. However, not until ten days, the entire city was infected. Several months later it spread to various parts of Mexico. In fact, the Aztec Emperor, Cuitlahuac, died of measles. He died with 8 million other Mexican residents in the tempo of not more than 10 months.\nThere is also the \u201cSpanish Flu\u201d that struck the land of the Matador in 1918. Within a few months, about half a billion world population is collapsed by the virus. In India, the virus kills 5 percent of the population (15 million people), in Tahiti there are 14 percent of the population killed, in Samoa even killing 20 percent of its occupants. Around the world, the outbreak killed 50 to 100 million in less than a year. Exceeding the First World War victims that only killed 40 million in more than 4 years.\nAs the transportation tools become more sophisticated and the mobility of humans is getting faster, the virus outbreak became a terrible added threat in this modern era. However, as the time progresses, human-controlled medical sciences are also increasing.\nIf we compare the virus handling over time, in the last two decades, it is much more efficient. Comparatively, a falling victim can be minimized. SARS, for example, that struck the world in 2002/2003. At that time, the world panic arose the second Black Death tragedy. However, successfully handled until TAM killed a thousand people.\nSo did the outbreak of Ebola in 2014 ago. The World Health Authority called the outbreak \u201cthe worst public health emergency ever in modern times\u201d. However, at the beginning of 2015, the WHO declared the virus to be tame. In January, 2016 was completed. The Virus, able to be localized only in West Africa alone. The victim was not significant compared to an epidemic in the past.\nFrom the historical record, we are optimistic to handle this Corona Virus, will take place for a long time. The victim can be minimized. Prevention is also massive.\nHowever, there is one interesting quote from Yufal about this theft of human biological. \u201cBiotechnology allows us to defeat bacteria and viruses, but at the same time transforming humans into a threat of no precedent,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cThe same tool that allows physicians to quickly identify and treat new diseases also allows the military and terrorists to engineer more horrible diseases and diseases of doom,\u201d he continued.\n\u201cTherefore, it is very likely that a big epidemic will continue to harm people in the future only if humanity itself created it, for the sake of cruel ideology. The Era when man stood helpless before the natural epidemic might have ended. However, we can still be mistaken, \u201che concluded.",

        "content": "The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Wuhan is currently causing concern in the medical community as the virus is spreading around the world.  Since identification of the virus in late December 2019, the number of cases from China that have been imported into other countries is on the rise, and the epidemiologic picture is changing on a daily basis. We are reporting a case of 2019-nCoV infection acquired outside Asia in which transmission appears to have occurred during the incubation period in the index patient. A 33-year-old otherwise healthy German businessman (Patient 1) became ill with a sore throat, chills, and myalgias on January 24, 2020. The following day, a fever of 39.1\u00b0C (102.4\u00b0F) developed, along with a productive cough. By the evening of the next day, he started feeling better and went back to work on January 27. Figure 1. Figure 1. Timeline of Exposure to Index Patient with Asymptomatic 2019-CoV Infection in Germany. Before the onset of symptoms, he had attended meetings with a Chinese business partner at his company near Munich on January 20 and 21. The business partner, a Shanghai resident, had visited Germany between January 19 and 22. During her stay, she had been well with no signs or symptoms of infection but had become ill on her flight back to China, where she tested positive for 2019-nCoV on January 26 (index patient in Figure 1 ) (see Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org, for details on the timeline of symptom development leading to hospitalization). On January 27, she informed the company about her illness. Contact tracing was started, and the above-mentioned colleague was sent to the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine in Munich for further assessment. At presentation, he was afebrile and well. He reported no previous or chronic illnesses and had no history of foreign travel within 14 days before the onset of symptoms. Two nasopharyngeal swabs and one sputum sample were obtained and were found to be positive for 2019-nCoV on quantitative reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. 2 Follow-up qRT-PCR assay revealed a high viral load of 10 8 copies per milliliter in his sputum during the following days, with the last available result on January 29. On January 28, three additional employees at the company tested positive for 2019-nCoV (Patients 2 through 4 in Figure 1 ). Of these patients, only Patient 2 had contact with the index patient; the other two patients had contact only with Patient 1. In accordance with the health authorities, all the patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection were admitted to a Munich infectious diseases unit for clinical monitoring and isolation. So far, none of the four confirmed patients show signs of severe clinical illness. This case of 2019-nCoV infection was diagnosed in Germany and transmitted outside Asia. However, it is notable that the infection appears to have been transmitted during the incubation period of the index patient, in whom the illness was brief and nonspecific. 3 The fact that asymptomatic persons are potential sources of 2019-nCoV infection may warrant a reassessment of transmission dynamics of the current outbreak. In this context, the detection of 2019-nCoV and a high sputum viral load in a convalescent patient (Patient 1) arouse concern about prolonged shedding of 2019-nCoV after recovery. Yet, the viability of 2019-nCoV detected on qRT-PCR in this patient remains to be proved by means of viral culture. Despite these concerns, all four patients who were seen in Munich have had mild cases and were hospitalized primarily for public health purposes. Since hospital capacities are limited \u2014 in particular, given the concurrent peak of the influenza season in the northern hemisphere \u2014 research is needed to determine whether such patients can be treated with appropriate guidance and oversight outside the hospital.

        "content": "China marked the Lunar New Year holiday, Saturday (25/1/2020), \"Under the Clouds \" fears and gloom when the number of victims died of a 2019 virus-nCoV spiked to 41 people. Nearly 1,300 people globally have also been infected. Chinese New Year is usually the most festive time in China, but holiday celebrations across the country have been cancelled and citizens are advised to \"squatting \" alone at home, with more than a dozen cities in the country closed or locked. On Saturday, when they were supposed to celebrate the Lunar New Year, people queued at pharmacies to buy masks from employees of the pharmacy who wore protective clothing throughout the body and surgical gloves. This Virus has raised global concerns due to its resemblance to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed hundreds of people in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. 2019-nCoV virus or dubbed as Wuhan Virus has spread to a number of other countries, including in America and Europe. The virus name 2019-nCoV stands for the 2019 Coronavirus Novel. Previously unknown diseases have now been reported to be a national outbreak in China. In France there are three confirmed cases and make it the first case in Europe. Chinese health authorities said on Saturday that the number of victims nationwide has spiked to 41 people after 15 recent deaths were reported to occur in in Wuhan on Friday. The number of confirmed infections in China also jumped to 1,287, up from 830 reported on Friday. Most of the deaths and overall cases exist in Hubei, the province where the city of Wuhan is located. China has launched a massive quarantine effort for Wuhan, a metropolitan city of 11 million people, and a dozen other cities in Hubei. The prohibition of transport operations and other actions in affected cities has affected 41 million people. Various Lunar New Year celebrations have been cancelled. The Forbidden City in Beijing is closed. As well as Shanghai Disneyland, and the Great Wall of China. \"We usually celebrate as a family. Now, since my virus didn't even visit my parents, \"said Wang Fang, a native of Wuhan 49 years old and one of the many townspeople who expressed fear of how the virus transmission would occur. \"It would be amazing just to be able to pass (plague), \" He said again. China's aggressive response has won praise internationally, especially compared with the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003, where the country was accused of slow reaction and inhibiting the international community. \"China has worked very hard to control Coronavirus, \" Praised United States President Donald Trump on Twitter, a few hours after the United States confirmed his second case. \"The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency,\" he said. \"Everything will go well,\" added the leader of the White House. But the plague has ruined the holidays that hundreds of millions of people are looking forward to every year because it is usually the only opportunity for family reunion whose members are scattered throughout the country to find work. The World Health Organization on Thursday does not declare a global health emergency, although this virus has spread to many countries. However, the Organization encourages greater international cooperation. The outbreak emerged in late December. Seafood markets in Wuhan and live animal markets that sell a large number of exotic animals and other wild animal meat are blamed upon the emergence of this deadly virus. Wuhan has been regarded as a ghost town, but the hospitals visited by AFP journalists are busy with patients who are inspected by staff wearing protective clothing throughout the body. When the report arose about the shortage of beds in the hospital in Wuhan, the government media said the authorities rushed to build a new field hospital to overcome the outbreak within the next 10 days.",

If my articles are boring to you, it may be that you need to read more of them, as was suggested by John Cage, \u201cIf something is boring after two minutes, try it for four. If still boring, then eight. Then sixteen. Then thirty-two. Eventually one discovers that it is not boring at all.\u201d\nIn the three great monotheistic religions, Islam, Christianity and Judaism, God is viewed as a supreme, transcendent being, beyond matter space and time, and yet the foundation of all that meets our senses that is described in terms of matter, space, and time. That is the Al Batin or the Hidden God of monotheism. Furthermore, this God is not the god of deism, who created the world and then left it alone, or the god of pantheism, who is equated with all of existence. The Islamic and the Judeo-Christian God is a nanosecond-by-nanosecond participant in each event that takes place in every cubic nanometer of the universe. He has full knowledge of all things. God listens to every thought and participates in each action of his very special creation, a minute bit of organized matter called humanity that moves around on the surface of a tiny pebble in a vast universe. The Holy Quran declares:\nAllah\u2019s is the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth; and to Allah are all affairs returned for final judgment. (Al Quran 57:6)\nWhereas the nineteenth century physics was about to frame God out of physical understanding of the universe, the twentieth century physics has turned the tables in favor of Monotheism.\nTo the atheists design in the universe is apparent but not real. For the theists, enlightened in science, the converse is true, the self sufficiency of the universe based on the laws of nature is apparent and perceived only and is not real. God is the Law Giver and sustainer of the universe. Both positions may be argued to some degree from modern science. However, only theism can offer a holistic approach, not only explaining our universe, but also human morality and ethics, our history and personal experience.\nWhen we approach science from this theistic perspective we find that our religion and science become one and our psyche finds unification.\nIf there is a \u2018Personal God\u2019 that hears human prayers then there has to be a way for the deity to influence the physical world without breaking the laws of nature and making the study of science futile. Quantum physics may be the magical wand, whereby Personal God can influence our world, without breaking the laws of nature. In His infinite wisdom, the Omniscient God provided for infinite means to maintain His divinity!\nThe article, the Indispensible God Hypothesis can be read online in the fall, 2008 volume, on page 22 of the PDF file: Muslim Sunrise Fall 2008.

        "content": "\"We fly to countries not only in good times\"\nAfrica's largest airline, Ethiopian Airlines, has revealed that suspending flights to China would not end the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.\nEthiopian Airlines operates 35 weekly flights to five destinations in China. Ethiopian was one of the few international airlines to launch flight to China in 1972. The airline on average transports 4,000 Chinese between China and Africa daily. Ethiopian serves Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Chengdu. Prior to the outbreak it had announced that it was planning to add three more destinations to China.\nEthiopian Airlines Group CEO Tewolde Gebremariam told The Reporter that his airline seconds the World Health Organization's (WHO) statement that states that isolating China is not a solution for the coronavirus outbreak. \"As WHO clearly stated that suspending flights to China would not end the coronavirus outbreak as victims of the virus are located in other countries,\" Tewolde said.\nSeventy percent of the Chinese passengers arriving Addis Ababa Bole International Airport transit to other African countries.\nTewolde said that the suspension of Ethiopian flights to China does not guarantee that the virus will not spread to Ethiopia. \"Even if Ethiopian suspends flights to China other airlines would bring passengers to Ethiopia. Secondly, through Star Alliance, code share and interline agreements Ethiopian will transport passengers originating from China. We fly to Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Japan and Korea. So we will transport passengers transiting in these countries,\" he said. \"Even if we stop flying to China, still, Chinese airlines can bring and feed us passengers in those countries. We daily fly to Bangkok. Thai Airways flies to China. If we stop flying to China, still, Thai would bring to us passengers from China,\" he said.\n\"We should not isolate China. We should not marginalize Chinese passengers. What we should do is screen passengers in accordance with the WHO guidelines,\" he added.\nBritish Airways has suspended flights to China but Chinese airlines are flying to the UK. Middle East carriers has scaled down their operations to China. Emirates suspended flights to Shanghai and Guangzhou but continues flying to Beijing. Major Chinese carriers like China Southern which operates more than 800 aircraft, Air China and China Eastern fly to the US, Europe and Asia.\n\"If we stop flying to China we can still bring passengers from Korea, the Philippines, Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand and that originated from China. So the most important thing is to strengthen the passenger screening mechanism and follow the WHO procedures,\" Tewolde said. He also underlined the need to ensure the wellbeing of the staff of the airline. \"We need to avail proper protective materials. We have to protect our flight crew and all other our colleagues, our passengers and our people,\" he said.\nAccording to Tewolde, Ethiopian is not an airline that flies to countries only at good times. \"Ethiopian Airlines serves countries in good and bad times. When Ebola outbreak hits African countries we were there. During the civil war in Angola 30 years ago we used to fly to Luanda amidst exchange of fire near the airport. Because they are our brothers and sisters we have to stand by them. China has a strong trade and investment relationship with Africa. And Ethiopian Airlines is the major carrier that links China with many African countries. If we stops flights to China we break that relationship,\" he said.\nSince the Ministry of Health began the flight screening at Addis Ababa Airport 1,500 Chinese passengers entered Ethiopia while 2,000 Chinese passengers transit to other African countries daily.\nTewolde said that Ethiopian Airlines is closely working with the Ministry of Health and the Ethiopian Public Health Institute.\nAsked why Ethiopian Airlines did not suspend flights to China, the Director General of the Ethiopian Public Health Institute Doctor Eba Abate said that the coronavirus cases reported in the five cities that Ethiopian fly to is minimal. Eba said the institute has tightened the passenger screening at the Addis Ababa Airport and 27 checkpoints.\nBody temperature of 47,167 passengers have been checked out of which 1,607 were from countries which reported cases of coronavirus. According to Dr. Eba, the institute is in the process to import the detergent used to test coronavirus.",

        "content": "Like every issue of consequence, in our Age of Incomprehension, opinion about the truth concerning the Corona virus outbreak is divided. Either China is taking all prudent steps, the virus, while transmissible, has a low mortality rate and the West, with its travel bans, is over-reacting in a vaguely racist manner, or China has the virus far from contained, we don\u2019t know just how transmissible it is nor its mortality rate because the figures from China can\u2019t be trusted and therefore travel bans are a wise precaution.\nIf travel bans to and from the infected parts of China turn out to have been justified then one country in particular may be worth watching, Ethiopia. Ethiopia\u2019s Bole International airport is the main African gateway to and from China. On average 1500 passengers per day arrive from China every day. Ethiopia scans them all for symptoms which essentially means taking their temperature.\nMany of those passengers then fly on to other parts of Africa where Chinese companies are doing business. These are 2018 figures courtesy of Brookings .\nThe three main areas of Chinese business in Africa are transport, which generally means building airports and railways, energy which means building power stations and grids and metals which means mines.\nOne of the airports the Chinese funded and built is Bole International Airport in Ethiopia.\nThe flights from China arriving at Bole International come from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Hong Kong. Just yesterday the Chinese government added China\u2019s 5th largest city Guangzhou to its list of locked down quarantined cities. Which strikes me as news. For Guangzhou to have been quarantined means it must already have a large number of cases. Guangzhou is not near to Wuhan, the source of the Corona virus outbreak. It is near to Hong Kong.\nIt is linked to both by high speed rail and internal air travel. Guangzhou airport is in fact the third busiest in China and the 13th busiest in the world handling over 65 million passengers per year.\nSo\u2026 the spread of the Corona virus in Guangzhou has got so serious that the Chinese government has quarantined it. Yet till now flights from there to Ethiopia were running. Of course I have no idea how many passengers were actually on those flights nor where they might have originated from. But the rail and air links from Wuhan and other cities to Guangzhou and the fact that Guangzhou is therefore the hub to which any workers going to Africa would have passed through, does raise a few questions. Remember, 1500 per day on average (meaning in \u2018normal times\u2019 which these are not) through Bole international from China alone.\nThe Ethiopian authorities have been scanning arrivals. But we know that one of the things which has made this virus difficult to contain is that people can carry it and spread it for up to 14 days before they show symptoms. This is one of the reasons the Chinese authorities, despite draconian measures, have failed to contain it. If the Chinese authorities have failed, how confident should we be the Ethiopian authorities and those in the other countries Chinese workers have travelled on to, will succeed?\nI have no idea and frankly neither does any one else. Which is surely the relevant point.\nWestern Counties have so far contained the virus and I think it likely they will continue to do so, simply because if you catch a virus outbreak early, you can . Viruses multiply and spread roughly according to a sigmoid curve. This plots the number of infections. At the start of an outbreak the curve is shallow simply because the numbers involved are small.\nDouble from 2 to 4 or 4 to 8 and its not that many new cases. That\u2019s the shallow part of the curve, the beginning of the outbreak. As the curve steepens its not that the virus is increasing its infection rate. The rate will not have changed at all. But the numbers involved grows. Still only doubling, but doubling from 8 to 16 to 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384\u2026you see the problem. Its nothing more than the law of big numbers. That law is what we are seeing in China in the quarantined cities. The question is IF and it still is, thankfully, an IF, some of the Chinese workers have carried the virus to Ethiopia or the African countries they work in, will those countries be able to contain it while they can, while the numbers are small?\nI hope so.

DEADLY: Corona virus has killed more than 100 people in China\nAccording to the results of the sputum test, the Corona virus NL63, as well as Human Rhinovirus and Influenza A (H1N1) were detected in the baby.\nBut this virus is different from the strain in China.\nCorona viruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds and can be transferred to humans.\nIn humans, it causes respiratory infections, including the common cold, but rarer forms like SARS and MERS can be lethal.\nThe name \u201ccorona virus\u201d is derived from the Latin word, meaning crown, and refers to the halo-like particles around the virus.\nSeven human corona viruses have been identified to date: two in the 1960s, and five since the deadly SARS outbreak in Asia in 2003.\nThe latest one in China, which broke out in December 2019, is suspected to have originated in a seafood market in Wuhan.\nThe mother says after reading that her child has corona virus, she panicked and tried to figure out how her baby could have caught it all the way from China.\n\u201cDoctors came to her bed (yesterday) and I just burst into tears thinking the worst, but the doctor explained that [pathologists] put corona virus on my results with a code which I did not understand.\n\u201cAs a parent, you just see corona virus and don\u2019t the knowledge and seeing her like this is heartbreaking.

        "content": "A January 24, 2020 study in The Lancet reported the latest statistics. (1) The fatality rate (so far) from the corona infection is approaching 15%. That is not good news.\nThere is a big HOWEVER here: This Lancet report is based on only 41 laboratory confirmed cases of the recent corona virus strain (2019-nCoV). Keep in mind, the 15% fatality rate is the percentage of hospitalized patients suffering with corona virus. There must be many more people who became ill with this corona virus and recovered uneventfully and therefore, did not seek care.\nThe symptoms of corona virus initially mimic the flu\u2014fever, headache, cough, fatigue and muscle aches. The 41 patients admitted to the hospital all developed pneumonia.\nCorona virus is nothing new. It has been with us for a long time. Corona virus can affect both animals and humans. It is important to keep in mind that most corona viral infections are mild. In the last two decades, there were two serious corona virus infections\u2013severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which both had elevated death rates.\nSo, what can you do? Wearing a mask will not help protect you from becoming ill with any viral infection\u2014corona virus included. I would check that off the list.\nFirst, it is important to maintain optimal levels of nutrients, particularly vitamins A, C, and D.\nMost people have suboptimal vitamin A and C levels. Both of these nutrients have antiviral abilities and are able to support the immune system when it is under viral attack.\nIf you are not ill, I suggest taking 3-5,000 mg/day of vitamin C. At the first sign of an illness, I would suggest taking 1,000 mg/hour until diarrhea develops, then back off for a time period.\nFor vitamin A, I suggest using 5,000 Units/day if you are not sick and 100,000 Units/day for four days at the first sign of an illness. Pregnant women cannot take these doses. (Note: Take vitamin A, not beta carotene.)\nAlso, vitamin D is very important for fighting infections. I suggest, at the onset of an illness, taking 50,000 IU of vitamin D3/day for four days.\nIodine is essential to not only fighting off an infection it is necessary for proper immune system functioning. There is no bacteria, virus, parasite or fungus that is known to be resistant to iodine.\nAs I have written in my book, Iodine: Why You Need It, Why You Can\u2019t Live Without It, most of the population is low in iodine. If fact, iodine levels have fallen nearly 60% over the last 40 years.\nThe RDA for iodine is inadequate to supply enough iodine for all the bodily tissues. For the majority of my patients, I suggest taking 25 mg/day as a daily dose and more (sometimes 50-100 mg/day) at the first sign of an illness. Iodine can cause adverse effects and it is best used under the guidance of an iodine-knowledgeable doctor.\nTo prevent becoming ill and to avoid having a poorly responding immune system, it is vitally important to eat a healthy diet free of all sources of refined sugar. Refined sugar has been shown to negatively alter the functioning of the white blood cells for hours after ingestion.\nFinally, it is important to maintain optimal hydration\u2014drink water! Take your body weight in pounds, divide by two and the resultant number is the amount of water to drink per day in ounces. Dehydration ensures you will be much more likely to suffer serious problems from any infectious process.\nConventional medicine has little to offer to prevent or treat corona virus infections other than washing your hands\u2013I agree with that one. It is time for you to take the initiative and learn what other therapies are out there. Your conventional doctor simply has no effective tools in his/her toolkit for this.\nAs for getting the flu shot? Fugetaboutit. It won\u2019t help corona infections and there was a study which found an increased risk in non-influenza infections, including coronavirus, in those that received the trivalent flu vaccine. (2)\nMy last recommendation is to work with a holistic doctor who can give you nutrient IVs when you become ill. Vitamin C, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone IVs can help anyone suffering from an infection. At my office, The Center for Holistic Medicine, we have seen the positive results a holistic approach to combatting viruses can provide.

        "content": "The current epidemic outbreak of coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCov) does not constitute a new or ultimate experience in Asia, so the steps to counteract this type of virus looks well established (Remember: 2012 (2012 MERS-Cov, 2002-2003 SARS-Cov) The current coronavirus 2019, has a 85 % coincidence with the genome of its cousin SARS-Cov, lacking to know the areas of mutation. Coronaviruses that infect humans now have 7 members, characterized by producing mild flu-like infections (most), evolving according to circumstances to pneumonia and/or to exitus letalis . And although the emerging Chinese power knows what to do, the constant increase in the number of infected and dead patients represents a challenge to its health procedures If China control the epidemic outbreak, will pass the end-of-course exam, consolidating worldwide management guidelines for these epidemic outbreaks. Analysis until 10.02,2020: 1) Chinese scientists have sequenced the coronavirus genome, having no identification problems of the virus (although the predictive value + and - of the tests is lacking). Researchers know their access routes to the human body and the organs where they like to stay to replicate respiratory tract, lungs, kidneys and death. However, after 2 months (including the incubation period estimated at 12 days), from the first infected case detected, dense people queues continue to form for blood samples, being observed in narrow hospital corridors, cohabitation of infected patients, carriers and not infected people, turning these areas into potential outbreaks spread of coronavirus. To counter this difficulty China builds in Wuhan at the speed of light: 2 prefabricated hospitals each with just over 1000 beds. 2) The signs and symptoms are known initial flu that resolves favorably in 97% of cases, followed by 3% of complicated cases with respiratory, renal and death failure. Only for this minimum proportion of cases, isolation is carved into strictly conditioned hospital units. Despite the isolation, in Hubei province (which includes Wuhan), there have been 42638 infected cases and 1016 deaths. One observes that the costumes of the health personnel have areas with exposed skin (wrists), the suits are not safe, they lack protective glasses, lack masks, surgical gowns, disinfectants. A Chinese doctor has died, and 15 health workers have been infected from a single patient. Contrary to the management of 2 infected patients in the USA, carried out with robots to perform chest auscultation and take samples, avoiding physical contact. Americans doctors and nurses wear costumes similar to those wearing astronauts, so the doctor-infected patient contact is nil. China has to improve their health procedures. Despite the above, with a 3% mortality (56 deaths from pneumonia) and 2000 infected, China shows progress with respect to the epidemic outbreak of 2002-2003 (SARS-Cov), which had 8890 infected, and 770 people dead (10 %). On 2020, the coronavirus: (2019-Cov), looks so far less aggressive which inspires confidence in the Chinese health system that expects to control the epidemic outbreak soon. But then why is the number of people infected in Hubei province (which includes Wuhan) increasing day by day, and internationally? What is failing? Each epidemic outbreak has its peculiarities, and, in this case, everything indicates that the central problems of the management of 2019 (2019-Cov), is to overcome the difficulties of high population density and the scrupulous monitoring of the contacts of those infected. Let us see a) population density : Wuxan, the city where the outbreak began 2 months ago, has 11,000,000 inhabitants, being an obligatory crossing area of several nearby cities that total 56,000,000 people. Given such high population density, the most efficient measure is to disperse as much as possible to the population while ensuring the therapy of the infected and b) monitoring the contacts of the infected. That is why the Chinese health system has arranged the execution of quarantines (insulations at home, hotels and lodges), restriction of the traffic of trains, airplanes and buses, temporary closure of centers for recreation of people for 15 days. The streets are empty and everything would be fine, except for the growing number of international infected patients (70), with one-digit figures in: Thailand, Australia, France, Belgium, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, Germany, Spain Sweden, Malaysia, Vietnam, United States, Russia, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, UAE, Philippines, Finnland, India, macao, Canada and Nepal, which were infected in health and commercial centers in Wuxan, reflecting problems of identification of carriers and infected in the entry and exit of foreigners in China. Are the tests already validated? Is there capacity to detect carriers in incubation period, with no apparent signs and symptoms?? And what about the congestion of people in the corridors of 20-story apartment buildings ? 3) As there is no specific cure, mild and severe cases receive symptomatic treatment, while preparing a vaccine that should have been ready in 3 weeks. However, once ready, vaccines face the challenge of mutations in the course of human infections. With the knowledge of epidemic outbreaks caused by previous coronaviruses and the relations between them, it is time to produce 2 types of vaccines one for the current coronavirus and another for when the virus mutates, calculated using computational models and probability theory (mutant vaccines). Given the threat of the outbreak spreading throughout the world, it is necessary to proceed quickly in these cases, all of the above should have been done in 4 weeks. Today, after 8 weeks the Chinese health system shows flaws, so China need to contact international experts with what the missing processes would be faster, winning China and all mankind. 4) In summary, the most important thing in the province of Hubei (the most affected) is to decrease population density by dispersing people even in open spaces, where the mutated virus will become inactive. In the environment it is impossible for a virus to survive 2 seconds. And what about the congestion of people in the corridors of 20-story apartment buildings? As there is no specific cure, mild and severe cases receive symptomatic treatment. The high number of cases is due to infections by person-person contact in cities with high population density. It is necessary to improve the strategies for identifying infected people without signs or symptoms and to follow up contacts of infected cases. The low mortality (3%) has influenced the decision of the WHO not to consider this outbreak as an international threat until today. However, the governments of the USA, Jordan and France, have announced that they will withdraw their diplomatic personnel from the province of Hubei, while the Chinese government has demanded that their health system be faster and more effective and, if possible, establish a centralized quarantine (Nobody enters, nobody leaves Wuxan), to control the outbreak. epidemic. Finally, there is suspicion of underreporting of infected patients due to lack of transparency or existence of not so accurate diagnoses in some health centers. ",

Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS and SARS). 2019-nCoV is more genetically related to SARS than MERS, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don\u2019t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS and MERS, we can use the information from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of 2019-nCoV associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of 2019-nCoV in the United States associated with imported goods.

From the outset, foreign nationals, especially European nationals, were included in the planning of the repatriation operations.\nThe first flight on board a military plane belonging to Esterel Squadron (Airbus A340) left Wuhan and returned 180 French nationals to France on January 31.\nA second civilian plane (Airbus A380), which also departed from Wuhan, landed in Istres on February 2 at 2:30 pm with 291 people from 30 countries, including France, on board: 254 passengers: 64 French nationals and eligible persons as well as 190 foreigners, including 135 nationals from the EU (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia and Sweden) and 55 nationals of third countries (Brazil, Georgia, North Macedonia, Mauritius, Mexico, Peru, the United Kingdom, Rwanda, Serbia, the Seychelles and Switzerland); 37 support staff, including 31 French nationals (25 government officials and 6 employees of the aircraft charter company) and 6 consular officials of third countries.\nThe two planes chartered by the French government also delivered medical equipment to Wuhan, donated by France to China to help address the coronavirus crisis.\nAt the request of the countries concerned, most European nationals were transferred to their countries of origin immediately upon arrival in France.\nVery strict health measures have been applied to the entire operation; in particular, a 14-day quarantine is required upon arrival. This measure applies to both citizens and foreigners residing on French soil.\nThis operation was conducted by the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs\u2019 Crisis and Support Center (CDCS) in coordination with the Ministry for Solidarity and Health, the Ministry for the Armed Forces, and the Ministry of the Interior. It was also carried out in close coordination with foreign partners, notably European institutions, EU member states and concerned third countries.\nFrance wishes to underscore the effective cooperation with the Chinese authorities that made the smooth conduct of this operation possible. Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian in fact discussed this subject with his counterpart, Wang Yi.\nThe Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs remains particularly attentive to the concerns of our compatriots abroad. Since January 23, our embassy in Beijing, our consulate-general in Wuhan and Ministry agencies have mobilized all their efforts in response to the Coronavirus crisis. France\u2019s consulate-general in Wuhan is in constant contact with our compatriots in Hubei and is monitoring their situation. The minister publicly applauded the services of the Quai d\u2019Orsay\u2019s Crisis and Support Center, our embassy in Beijing and our Consulate-General in Wuhan, which were \u201cexemplary\u201d and were \u201cutterly at the service of our compatriots to reassure them on one hand, and to help repatriate them on the other.\u201d",

Of the 213 returning Canadians and their family members, none have exhibited symptoms of the novel coronavirus.\nA second and final chartered flight is planned to transport Canadians from Wuhan to Canada.\nWe welcome the leadership of the World Health Organization and continue to work with our international partners to support the global initiatives that are helping to strengthen health systems and to improve early detection of viruses such as the novel coronavirus. We will also continue working with provinces and territories in the days and weeks to come, as well as continuing to liaise with Canadian consular officials to assist other Canadians who may be affected.\nWe would like to remind Canadians that the risk of spread of this virus within Canada remains low at this time. We have measures in place to protect the health and safety of Canadians here at home and those who are returning. Quotes\n\u201cI want to thank everyone who helped bring these Canadians home safely. They have undoubtedly undergone a stressful situation and we are thankful that they are back in Canada.

Chinese authorities have so far confirmed 9,700 cases all over the country and more than 100 in 19 other countries.\nAmid the mounting death toll and sky rocketing infections, Level 1 emergency response has been launched for 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities on the Chinese mainland. National capital Beijing is making special efforts and is reviving 17 year old hospital used to fight SARS.\nChinese health authorities have confirmed the number of coronavirus cases in mainland China had surpassed the tally of people infected by SARS during the 2002-03 epidemic. For now, the mask shortage has become a country-wide problem. China\u2019s ministry of Industrial and Information technology said that due to the national holiday, current mask production is over eight million each day, comparing to 20 million in normal days. China is trying to purchase it from overseas.\nPrevention and control efforts are in full swing and have been intensified, but the epidemic keeps spreading, with a rapid rising trend in some regions. China has seen 171 recoveries till now and is trying to engage the communities more vigorously to put up a united fight against the devil virus.\nAs Wuhan residents are enduring an isolated, frightening time a hotline has been opened in central China\u2019s Hubei Province to help people maintain psychological health amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.\nMedical workers, teachers, students and the general public can call the hotline number 4007027520 to request help for psychological issues related to the epidemic. An official WeChat account has also been set up to provide 24-hour service. China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce has said in a circular that China will release winter and spring vegetable reserves in major northern cities to ease supply shortages.\nFood supply trucks and cargo ships have been given special permission for transportation. Ministry of Civil Affairs said, Social organizations that spread false information or engage in illegal activities during the new coronavirus outbreak will be severely punished.\nChinese experts are hopeful that an inflection point is likely to appear within the next one or two incubation periods which means roughly next 1 month. During the virus infection stage, the human body produces antibodies, which reduces the level and capability of the virus.\nIt also becomes less pathogenic and contagious. If a vaccine can be made quickly and with improved intervention measures, like early detection and quarantine, inflection points would appear even earlier. It is also essential to prevent the virus from mutating. Chances of such mutating are not much, but it may still cause some serious problems.\nMeanwhile, Chinese Foreign Ministry today announced that it will send charter flights to bring home residents of Corona virus-hit Hubei province from abroad in view of practical difficulties they are facing. The move followed Chinese officials\u2019 announcement that about five million people from Hubei province and capital Wuhan, the epicentre of Corona virus, have travelled out of the region before the province was officially closed on 23rd of January.\nEarlier, World Health Organization has declared an international emergency over the deadly virus. It is a rarely used designation that could lead to improved international co-ordination in tackling the disease. WHO Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that their greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems.\nHe declared the disease a Public Health Emergency of international concern. Mr Tedros, who travelled to China this week and met Chinese President Xi Jinping, said all the concerned people must act together now to limit further spread.\nEven though China and countries worldwide have launched extraordinary measures, the Declaration of an international emergency will undoubtedly sharpen various governments\u2019 focus on protecting citizens.\nThe declaration of a global emergency triggers recommendations to all countries aimed at preventing or reducing the cross-border spread of disease while avoiding unnecessary interference with trade and travel. It covers temporary recommendations for national health authorities worldwide, which include stepping up their monitoring, preparedness and containment measures.\nAlthough the WHO has no legal authority to sanction countries, it could ask governments to provide scientific justification for any travel or trade restrictions that they impose in the event of an international emergency.\nEven though WHO has praised china\u2019s efforts but declaration would definitely have increased the pressure little bit as china is racing against time to contain it.\nFrom regular dissemination of information to carrying out disinfection work, from the high-quality treatment of patients to ensuring essential supplies in Wuhan and a hotline, china has mounted an extraordinary fight against the virus.\nThe US Government has issued fresh advice against travel to China. This is the highest of the four-level warning system. The State Department\u2019s advice was followed after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a global emergency. ",

In Latin, corna meant 'crown,' and modern languages continue to reflect that; 'corona' still translates to crown in modern Catalan, Spanish, and Italian, among others.\nCoronaviruses were named because of the crown-like spikes on its surface, and anyone who has ever peeled the label off a bottle of Corona Light has noticed the crown that sits on top of its \"La Cerveza Mas Fina\" slogan. The drinkable Corona does predate the virus, though: Corona was first brewed in 1925, while human coronaviruses were not identified until 1965.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, conflating a respiratory virus with a brand of beer isn't the dumbest piece of misinformation that has appeared on the internet. The Daily Beast reports that the conspiracy purveyors at QAnon are suggesting that the best way to protect yourself from coronavirus is by drinking bleach. In both tweets and videos, QAnon associates have suggested that their followers should purchase and consume a product called Miracle Mineral Solution, Miracle Mineral Supplement, or simply MMS.\nIm going to have to get home, and MMS the whole state, the outlet Quote: : d QAnon promoter Jordan Sather as saying during a recent video. MMS the whole shit out of everything. There are a number of problems with that, including the fact that MMS is made with an industrial bleaching agent.\nLast summer, the FDA issued a warning against drinking MMS and other products that contain sodium chlorite and chlorine dioxide. \"The FDA has received reports of consumers who have suffered from severe vomiting, severe diarrhea, life-threatening low blood pressure caused by dehydration, and acute liver failure after drinking these products,\" the agency wrote at the time.\n",

CDC/ Dr. Fred Murphy; Sylvia Whitfield\nSimilar signs appeared in medical offices and EDs across the city. Truth be told, when the signs first went up, some thought it was an overreaction. I practice in a city in the Southeast that is not a port of entry and has no scheduled international passenger flights. Wuhan City, China and the threat of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) seemed very far away.\nAs the international tally of cases has grown, so have local concerns.\nHopefully, proactive public health measures to care for the few individuals currently infected in the United States and appropriately assessing individuals arriving from mainland China will prevent widespread circulation of 2019-nCoV here. If this is the case, most of us likely will never see a case of the virus. Still, there are important lessons to be learned from current preparedness efforts.\nA travel history is important. Public health authorities long have emphasized the importance of a travel history. Several years ago, during the height of concern over the spread of Ebola, the health care systems in which I practice asked everyone about travel to West Africa as soon as they approached the registration desk. In the intervening years, asking about a travel history largely was delegated to providers, and I suspect it largely was driven by patient presentation. Child presenting with 10 days of fever? The clinician likely took a travel history. Child presenting for runny nose, ear ache, or rash? Maybe not. With more consistent screening, we are learning how frequently our patients and their families do travel, and that is helping us expand our differential diagnosis. ",

A team at Imperial school London believes they will be the primary to begin testing a possible immunogen on mice. The novel coronavirus, that has simply formally been named Covid-19 by the globe Health Organization (WHO), was 1st reported on December 31 , 2019, in Wuhan, China. Since then, it's managed to hitch a ride with numerous travelers to create its approach across Asia to Europe, North America, and Oceanica . However, the overwhelming majority of cases and deaths have occurred in China, with only one death reported outside the country within the Philippines. As Covid-19 has solely recently appeared in humans, we have a tendency to lack immunity thereto as a result of our immune systems haven't had to touch upon the virus before.

        "content": "The British election in December has brought order to the proceedings of Brexit, although it is uncertain how long that will last. The exit of Prince Harry and his wife from royal duties has demonstrated some deep social rules. The emergence of a novel corona virus is causing deep concern around the world.\nBrexit\nThe roadmap for Great Britain leaving the European Union has been set and the British will be officially leaving at the end of the week. The election back in December made this possible by bringing certainty to the political situation in Britain. I remain agnostic about the wisdom of this plan in the long term, but the short term turmoil of the past few years has left me somewhat skeptical that the British political system will be able to navigate a path to a brighter future for the youth of Great Britain.\nThe election itself demonstrated a phenomenon that people on the left of the political spectrum need to take very seriously. Despite all the failures of the current economic model, the public is simply not prepared to embrace the socialist policies that have proven to be failures in the past. There appeared to be every reason to believe that the Conservatives under Boris Johnson could be defeated, but the only party with a chance of doing so, chose to embrace policy positions that were more unpalatable to the British people than the prospect of Brexit. Failed socialist policies of the past are not a recipe for electoral victory in the future. The left has to come up with new economic ideas.\nAnd I absolutely believe they should because the current system is not working anywhere near as well as the self proclaimed champions of the right are stating. The economies of the developed world are not working efficiently in the manner that capitalism suggests that they should. I am prepared to argue that the problem is not capitalism but rather cronyism hiding behind a facade of capitalism, and the political establishment is using their regulatory power to protect the economic establishment rather than ensuring that there is a fair playing field for all players as is required for capitalism to work efficiently. Populists and anti-establishment politicians are succeeding because the economic system isn't working for large segments of the population.\nThe British election resolved the near term uncertainties surrounding Brexit and things are proceeding apace. The longer term uncertainties however, remain unresolved. The fabric of Great Britain itself is under immense strain and it is going to require great skill on the part of Prime Minister Johnson to keep that fabric from unraveling. I am not convinced he is up to the task. That being said, he has bought himself time to find a solution that is tolerable to the non-English parts of the nation. Desirable options are too much to expect, but tolerable solutions are possible. By this, I would think that Mr. Johnson has to deliver reasonable trade arrangements sooner rather than later with major countries other than the European Union. By major countries I mean the US, India, and Japan. Good luck.\nAt least however, there should not be major turmoil emanating from Westminster over the summer.\nMegxit\nI find the reaction to the decision of Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex to withdraw from royal duties to be quite curious. It is as if people are shocked that the inevitable has happened. From the moment Prince Harry started to pursue Ms. Markle, the royal family should have started to make preparations for this moment. It was inevitable. And yet the royal family seems to have been even more surprised than the public.\nI find it very curious that people are blaming the Duchess of Sussex for this situation. Of course she is responsible, how could it be otherwise. The Bible itself states that a man will leave his parents and cleave unto his wife. This is a basic fact of human relationships that a man will value his relationship with his wife above that with his greater family. That Ms. Markle would accept what amounts to a junior role in the royal family should have not come as a surprise to anyone. She was not raised in an environment where she was required to show deference to others based on anything other than earned respect. The royal family had nothing to offer her that would have made the role they chose for her to be palatable.\nI understand that some elements within the British press and the British public resorted to racist tropes to express their displeasure with the Duchess. But that was not the cause of her unhappiness, It certainly contributed, but it was not the cause. The role she was expected to play was simply not something she was psychologically prepared for, which led to her failure to behave as the public expected.\nHer failure to dutifully fulfill the expectations of her new title in the manner that the public expected was the source of many of their racist taunts. Her first failure to meet their expectations came the day she was born in a foreign land. Her racial heritage was just a convenient way to needle her for failing to be born in England. When people are angry, they aim for sore spots on their target.\nBut the truth of the matter is that the outcome was almost inevitable regardless of who Prince Harry married. He chose Ms. Markle because of her character, which means that whoever he married would have had similar character traits, which made this event inevitable.\nWhich is why it is surprising to me that the royal family was not prepared for this. Prince Harry has demonstrated an independent streak his whole life. His acceptance of a junior role in the family was something that he was only ever going to accept as long as he did not have something better to do, or have a wife who wanted something more than bowing to the Duchess of Cambridge. (I am making no comment on the character of the Duchess of Cambridge, only on royal protocol.)\nThe royal family should have been prepared for this and they should have had a procedure in place to facilitate Prince Harry's departure.\nThe Corona Virus\nThe emergence of a novel corona virus in Wuhan China is posing significant alarm. The preliminary data does not suggest that that alarm is warranted but the fact that this is a novel virus means that health authorities must be vigilant to ensure that they are prepared in case that alarm is warranted.\nThe data that I am referring to is the mortality rate. The number of fatal cases does not suggest that this is a particularly dangerous virus. When the mortality rate for a virus is in the low single digits for confirmed cases, it is difficult to think that it is a virus that will cause a catastrophic pandemic. A low single digit mortality rate is something to be taken seriously, but not alarmed. Given that the virulence of viruses tends to decline with time, this virus should run its course in a couple of months. Vigilance is warranted since it could mutate, but barring that, I do not expect to be talking about this virus in two months time.\nWhat is of interest is the public response to the Chinese governments response. The Chinese people seem to be reacting very skeptically to the Chinese governments' statements and that is filtering out to the rest of the world. This is why sensible governments try to be as open and transparent with their people as they can. When a crisis develops, the government needs the trust of the people. The Chinese government does not have that trust.\nHaving said that, I will now say that I believe the Chinese government is being reasonably transparent in reporting on the virus over the past couple of weeks. It very much appears that local authorities did try to conceal the outbreak in the initial stages, but it also appears that once the national authorities were alerted, they started acting in a much more transparent manner.\nMany of the criticisms that are being leveled at the Chinese government regarding a lack of transparency can be attributed to delays in colating reports from various hospitals and officials. Keeping statistics current when there are hundreds of hospitals in the infection zone is something that is not possible for any government.\nSome reports are not going to be included in the statistics for days after they are submitted at which point they will be superceded by more recent reports. Every government struggles with status reports during a crisis, the Chinese government is no exception and they should not be criticized for not doing the impossible. Which is not the same as saying they should not be watched for signs of a lack of transparency, only that a lack of transparency should not be presumed when there are other reasonable explanations for incomplete or dated data.\n",

I believe it is no coincidence that this virus has a Mexican connection and is visited on China while they are treating President Brother Donald Trump so rudely in trade negotiations. Mexico is another country President Trump is having to deal with. The connection is undeniable. It is clear then that God is on our side and He is helping to turn the tables on our enemies, which are many.

Social Construct Location: Godly Texas, Besieged by Papist Idol Worshippers Re: God Sends Corona Virus Plague to Ravage the Heathen Chinamen - 01-23-2020, 02:50 PM Now comes word that a Chinaman who is some kind of professor in Reynosa, which is a city full of illegal aliens right across the border from Brownsville Texas, has gone back to godless China and got some of that virus and carried it back to Mexico. He's had it for a month or more and no doubt left a trail of death and destruction in his wake, but no one noticed his wake of destruction among all the other wakes of destruction in Mexico. This is a serious matter. God has intended this virus to scourge the Chinamen and He does not want Chinese diseases to invade America. It could be His way of letting us know He is sick and tired of our backsliding ways and intends that we finally do something about Mexico. Over the years they have gotten closer and closer and now they are right across a little river from us. The time for talk is over! I propose an immediate airstrike on Reynosa and the surrounding area. Others more skilled at bombing can decide what armaments to drop on those people, but they need to be bombed today. President Brother Donald Trump has already sent some B-52's to a Mexican island named Diego Garcia and those could be used for the mission. There must be no delay.

This morning we have received word that the Lord has sent Chinamen carrying this new disease to other parts of the world in need of lashing. There are at least two cases reported on the godless West Coast including one in the seething, sin filled city of Los Angeles. One of the devious Asiatic devils has been captured in Chicago. Other reports suggest that thousands of infected wretches from China are leaving for points the world over where communists are welcomed and concealing their infections, so as to spread this illness among others. They think they are doing the work of their master Satan, but the joke's on them- It is God's work they are doing and mighty must be the satisfaction in Heaven today. I note that where the Lord has sent His vengeance here in America, it is only affecting the areas overcome by sin. There are rivers, deserts and (in the case of Chicago) glaciers, ice and snow between the punishment and godly America. We are in no danger here because we are beloved by God.

Please listen to this before dismissing it out of hand. There is something odd about Novel coronavirus.\nFirst, we are told that it originated in the Huahan Seafood Market, but according to a Lancet article patient zero had no connection whatsoever ( https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)... ) with the Seafood Market.\nSecond, this virus has some highly unusual properties that are not seen in any typical upper respiratory infection. It is unusual for a virus to be very infectious without symptoms. For example, The common cold is infectious from a few days before your symptoms appear until all of the symptoms are gone. Flu is usually most infectious from the day your symptoms start and for a further 3 to 7 days. That is because in order to spread from one person to another, a virus usually has to be present in large amounts in the body. This virus is insanely infectious before symptoms begin.\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/infections/how-long-is-s...\nThird, the genomic properties are highly unusual. It is an RNA virus which mutates unusually fast, making it difficult to treat as its signature changes all the time. According to Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding, a search of 2019-nCoV middle fragment revealed no considerable similarity with any of the previously characterized corona viruses. Notably, the new coronavirus provides a new lineage for almost half of its genome, with no close genetic relationships to other viruses within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. This genomic part comprises also half of the spike region encoding a multifunctional protein responsible also for virus entry into host cell. Our study rejects the hypothesis of emergence as a result of a recent recombination event.\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.26.920249v1\nNotably, the virus binds to ACE2 receptors which are far more common among Asian men. The result indicates that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). Surprisingly, we found that this population of ACE2-expressing AT2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral reproduction and transmission. A comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the Asian male one has an extremely large number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung. We also noticed that the only Asian donor (male) has a much higher ACE2-expressing cell ratio than white and African American donors (2.50% vs. 0.47% of all cells).\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.26.919985v1.full\nFourth, the virus originated in the most central city in China at the time most likely for it to spread uncontrolled, the even of the Lunar New Year where travel is massive.\nWhile there is no proof it is a bioweapon, the confluence of factors is highly unusual. Before this, the Chinese nation was heavily feared as a rising challenge to the established world order. Those who want to see a weaker China and reverse its economic gains have great cause to privately celebrate the emergence of coronavirus.\n",

On the one hand, those hopes were fulfilled with the CR3022, but the four other antibodies, including the synthetic cure m336, created several years ago in the Wuhan Institute of Virology, failed to react to the viral protein.\nThis discovery has greatly surprised the scientists, since computer models did not indicate that slight RBD differences would make the 2019-nCoV invulnerable to those protein molecules. The scientists now study the infected blood samples, in hopes to find other antibodies that would bind with the coronavirus more effectively than the CR3022 does.\nThe novel coronavirus\nOn December 31, 2019, Chinese authorities informed the World Health Organization (WHO) about an outbreak of an unknown pneumonia in the city of Wuhan \u2014 a large trade and industrial center in central China populated by 11 million people. On January 7, Chinese experts identified the infecting agent: coronavirus 2019-nCoV.\nAccording to recent data, over 6,000 people have been infected with the virus, with 132 people dead. The virus continues to spread in China and other states, including Australia, Vietnam, Italy, Germany, Cambodia, Malaysia, Nepal, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, the US, Thailand, France, Sri Lanka and Japan.\nThe new virus belongs to the same group as the coronavirus of the well-known severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Both viruses have claimed lives of several hundred people in the Middle East and East Asia, causing repeated epidemics, spread through camels and poultry. The initial carriers of the 2019-nCoV virus were bats, the scientists believe.\nAll three pathogens relate to the so-called coronaviruses. They cause similar symptoms: fever, cough, trouble breathing and constant phlegm production. The incubation period is up to 12 days, followed by the strongest fever. Most lethal cases happened due to exhaustion, complications and accompanying infections when left unattended.",

China has also announced that it plans to build a 1,000-bed hospital within a week to treat coronavirus.\nThose stories either indicate that China is taking very seriously its responsibility to its people and to the world at large to stop an inconvenient and somewhat dangerous virus from spreading or it means that the Chinese government is scared and panicking.\nOne nurse in China says it\u2019s the latter. The nurse, wearing heavy protective garb that hides her identity, has published a video claiming that 90,000 people have the coronavirus in Wuhan\nI am here to tell the truth.

If a person who is infected with coronavirus, if you can\u2019t isolate someone who is infected with the virus, if you can\u2019t make the right treatment to them, at least 14 people will be infected by that virus at once.

I hope you understand everything what I say.\nSome family members, relatives, friends, and some people aren\u2019t getting this news right now. If you are watching this video, please spread this video away. We must be aware of this issue. This is a political challenge. (It seems the government keep the secret about this issue.)\nWe should inform everyone that coronavirus is now growing up to secondary mutation. In other words, first-generation mutations can cure symptoms. But, if a second-generation mutation occurs, something really terrible happens will come. That\u2019s because the infection is not just for one person, but for everyone around you (at least 10 people). If so, coronavirus will explode.\nI will ask again. Never go out and do not eat out. Thank you very much.\nYou may want to stock up on disinfecting gel. Also, don\u2019t eat bats, mice, or snakes . They are more likely to be disease vectors than our domesticated animals, which have been bred for human diets and are raised, slaughtered, and cooked in ways that minimize disease.\nMeanwhile, the inimitable Paul Joseph Watson points out that, even now, both to \u201csave the planet\u201d and to show sophistication, the Left is encouraging Americans to eat animals not normally part of the Western diet and contending that saying otherwise is racist.",

So, an update: The Southampton school was deep-disinfected because some kids had a cold when they came back from Singapore. Fair play, better safe then sorry. Mr Super-spreader has been given the all-clear and sent home. He's no longer infectious. Hopefully. There's a prisoner in Bullingdon jail that is suspected of having the virus after being shipped over from Thailand. We'll see how that pans out. A bunch of people (apparently foreign tourists) in London are in isolation at St. Thomas' after having flu-like symptoms after coming back from the far East. So, thankfully it appears the UK is on top of the situation. Thankfully we closed down direct flights from China some days ago. I was surprised to see a video that insinuated that the USA hadn't closed down air links to China. A bad move, considering anyone can walk through the border without symptoms but still be carrying the virus. Even indirect flights might be a risk as it's a way of subverting the bio-security afforded by the closure of direct links. I've actually got a car part coming from Hong Kong. Hopefully it'll be in the post long enough so the virus won't be a risk factor. ;-) Maybe I'll give it a wipe with a disinfectant wipe, just in case... But hopefully as we reach the limits of the quarantine/incubation period, the UK will emerge COVID-19 clear. Then we just nuke China... sorry, I mean hopefully the Chinese can get on top of the virus and get back to normality. ",

        "content": "The Chinese people were supposed to celebrate the lunar new year the last weekend. Nobody would have expected things to take a turn for the worst. Instead of enjoying a traditional family dinner, people were forced to stay away from each other, avoid social contacts, wear personal protection and stay at home. The cause of this situation I'm talking about is, of course, the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus, abbreviated as nCoV. The virus is believed to have jumped into a human host at the end of December last year. The origin of this virus is attributed currently to a 'wet market' in Wuhan, China.\nThe said Coronavirus is a blanket family of viruses that are commonly encountered by humans. The SARS, MERS outbreaks during the 2000s were also caused by these types of viruses. The specialty of the situation now is that this virus is 'novel' in nature. This means that it has not been found in humans before. Such incidents happen only when the virus which previously was native to an animal has mutated its genome (RNA) to have the ability to bind to human proteins. This mutation is in itself a rare event, and it must be the rarest of the rarest for a human to come in contact with this particular strain of the virus in an animal. But, the reality is that this has already happened. The virus has been observed to spread between people and is transmissible by air or close contact. [2]\nIn the last few days, the news coming from China is not very encouraging. The first serious step, which was to quarantine the entire of Wuhan was taken just a few days ago when the actual infection has been spreading since the end of December. This delay has cost us some valuable time. During this period the virus might have spread to a greater distance from its epicenter.\nWuhan is a hub for cross-provincial travel in mainland China and also for international air travel. This metro of nearly 20 million people has experienced a continuous flux of people from all over the place during the last few weeks. This must be attributed mainly to the celebration of the Chinese New Year. People from all walks of life travel across China to be with their loved ones on New Year's eve. And therefore the virus might have easily found its passage to distant parts of China.\nAs of today, the official figures from China indicate that there are over 7,700 infected people with about 170 dead. Some 130 odd people have been able to recover according to the statistics from China. The fact that some could be recovered is owed to the perseverance of the medical staff in China. The previous such outbreak of such a virus was of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS) in 2003. It saw 8000+ cases of infected people after a period of 8 months at its peak. The nCoV might be much more serious than SARS because of its rapid spreading ability. The spreading capability of a virus is denoted by its R-0 (R-naught) number. For the 2019-nCoV its 2.3 - 5. For SARS it was about the same, but with a lower base value ie, 2 - 5. This variable indicates the number of people the virus can spread from an infected individual. This means the nCoV can be as much or more infectious than SARS. [1]\nChina has already seen what SARS can do. It would be expected that they have the resources and manpower required to curb the spread of the virus before it becomes a global pandemic. But several personal accounts tell a different story. The medical staff seem to be overworked and lacking in hospital supplies to take care of the patients. This must be addressed if the situation is to be brought under control.\nThe fact that China has been developing its economy, infrastructure, etc. at a very fast pace is no shock to anybody. Even in such prosperity, the nation is strained when it comes to the health of the citizens. This is due to the fact that the social framework in China has not developed with the economy. Basic hygiene is still lacking in a sprawling metro like Wuhan which is one of the most developed cities in China, at par with cities like Shenzen and Beijing.\nThis situation should come through as a lesson for India. We are now witnessing the effects of an epidemic in a neighboring country that has a population close to India. The medical services are being strained under the pressure of an ailing mass. So this is a good time to rethink our approach to health and hygiene. It is no secret that only a healthy population can drive a nation to great heights. India needs to do much more in the health sector. This includes the development of social infrastructure, planned development in cities, enforcing health codes in public spaces, etc. [3]\nImagine the scale of the outbreak if this virus finds its way into India, assuming that it has not yet done so. But a high percentage of the Indian population is economically poor. This will definitely hinder their ability to get themselves treated for the disease if they catch it. This is nothing but a gargantuan task for any country. If such a dystopian regime in China is in the pressure cooker due to the nCoV situation, we can imagine the response a democratically responsible government is capable of. Democratic processes cannot lock down a whole state, a city or a metro, without facing resistance from the people. This in any way, does not justify the existence of an authoritarian govt. ever, but the limitations of a democratic govt. should be kept in mind. India blocking all travel to and from China does not make any significant difference now as it has been observed that the virus can spread in its asymptomatic mode and, carriers might still exist in India. The people and the govt. would have to work together in any case, removing all barriers political, social, and economical, if India ever plans to take such epidemics on.\nLet me end this with a hope that the virus would stop its mayhem either by itself or with human intervention. Either way, it will be a blessing to humanity, if it does.",

In response to this situation, and immediately after the occurrence of unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan, BGI sequenced the genome of the new 2019-nCoV virus and successfully developed a Real-Time (RT) Fluorescent PCR (polymerase chain reaction) kit for detecting 2019-nCoV, which can provide results in a few hours and has already obtained approval by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration. In addition to the rapid detection kit based on RT-PCR technology, the DNBSEQ-T7 sequencing platform developed by the BGI Group company MGI passed the emergency approval procedure of the National Medical Products Administration, becoming the first officially approved testing products in China for surveillance, discovery and identification of unknown infectious diseases. In Europe, BGI and MGI will work with their long-term strategic partner Ares Genetics to make its 2019-nCoV testing portfolio available to public health institutions and hospitals for outbreak monitoring, infection control, and epidemiology. Ares Genetics expects to provide next-generation sequencing services for 2019-nCoV out of its NGS laboratory in Vienna Austria for infection control and tracking of pathogen evolution from February 2020 onwards based on MGI\u2019s DNBSEQ sequencing platform. Further, Ares Genetics and the Curetis Group will support BGI Group in the distribution of its PCR and NGS reagent kits to molecular testing laboratories in Europe that have the capability for 2019-nCoV testing with reagent kits initially being marketed for research use only prior to regulatory approval in Europe. Ares Genetics is a digital diagnostics company utilizing artificial intelligence-powered molecular diagnostics to advance the field of infectious disease testing. Ares Genetics recently launched ARESupa \u2013 Universal Pathogenome Assay for the broad identification of bacterial pathogens and the accurate prediction of antibiotic susceptibility. The ARESupa test is based on the sequencing of bacterial DNA, combined with data analysis and interpretation powered by ARESdb, Ares Genetics\u2019 unique, proprietary reference database on genetic antimicrobial resistance markers. The first generation of ARESupa is currently offered for non-diagnostic applications in epidemiology, infection control, and outbreak analysis for customers in the public health sector and the pharmaceutical industry. A laboratory-developed test (LDT) for human diagnostic use is under development. \u201cThe ability to rapidly test for 2019-nCoV with PCR as well as track its evolution by next-generation sequencing is key to contain this global outbreak. While Ares Genetics specializes in molecular detection of bacterial pathogens and antibiotic susceptibility prediction, we are responding to the global coronavirus health threat via our specialized molecular service laboratory and making 2019-nCoV testing broadly available in Europe under our strategic partnership with BGI.\u201d commented Dr. Andreas Posch, Managing Director and CEO of Ares Genetics, \u201cLonger-term, we anticipate that adding viruses to the scope for ARESupa will also significantly augment its utility as an aid in the differential diagnosis of viral and bacterial infections.\u201d ###\nAbout ARESupa Universal Pathogenome Assay Information on antibiotic susceptibility of pathogens is of utmost importance for clinical practice, epidemiology and public health purposes as well as for the development of pharmaceutical products in the infectious disease sector. Ares Genetics therefore has developed a molecular Antibiotic Susceptibility Test (AST) that is marketed under the brand name ARESupa \u2013 Universal Pathogenome Assay and is capable of accurately identifying microbial pathogens as well as predicting antibiotic susceptibility via artificial intelligence-powered interpretation of high-throughput DNA sequencing data obtained by next-generation sequencing technologies. ARESupa is based on whole-genome sequencing of bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens, combined with data analysis and interpretation powered by ARESdb, Ares Genetics\u2019 unique, proprietary reference database on genetic antimicrobial resistance markers. ARESdb covers genomes of about 40,000 bacterial strains and associated susceptibility data for more than 100 different antibiotics. ARESupa already today accurately detects antibiotic susceptibility broadly across drug/pathogen combinations with prediction algorithms for further drug/pathogen combinations in development. The test is initially offered for non-diagnostic applications in epidemiology, infection control, and outbreak analysis for customers in the public health sector and the pharmaceutical industry. A laboratory-developed test (LDT) on native patient samples for human diagnostic use in indications in which current culture-based diagnostic practice is inherently challenging is planned. Furthermore, Ares Genetics has recently entered into a multi-phase strategic partnership with an undisclosed leading global in vitro diagnostics corporation to jointly develop diagnostic solutions for infectious disease testing based on the ARESupa.\nFor further information and quotes, please register on the Ares Genetics cloud platform",

        "content": "The global economy is in a much different place to 2002-03, when the SARS outbreak hit. But China's importance to the Australian economy is very different, too. \nThere\u2019s little agreement about the potential impacts of the coronavirus on global markets , but one thing many commentators agree on is that comparisons with the SARS outbreak of 2002-03 are fraught.\nThe argument goes that world, and the global economy, was in a very different place then .\nThe rise in cases of the coronavirus is spooking global markets. Getty\nAs RBC\u2019s chief US economist Tom Porcelli said on Tuesday morning, the fact the Bush the Younger\u2019s Iraq War was raging at the time makes comparisons next to useless.\nThe timelines are remarkably similar. President George W Bush signed the resolution authorising military force against Iraq October 16, 2002, exactly a month before the first case of what would come to be be called SARS was reported in Guangdong, China. The Iraq War then began in earnest on March 19, 2003, one week after the WHO issued a global alert for SARS.\n\u201cThe point is: how can we possibly disentangle the market reaction to the build-up and start of the Iraq War from that of SARS? We can\u2019t,\u201d Porcelli says. Advertisement\nAnother big difference is the state of the bellwether US economy, which he argues was on the verge of a double-dip recession, with unemployment rising and consumer confidence shot. Compare that with today, when consumer confidence is near all-time highs and US jobless claims are near 65-year lows.\n\u201cThe fundamental backdrop could not be more different,\u201d Porcelli says.\nThat makes plenty of sense. But it\u2019s worth remembering that is not just global economic conditions that have changed \u2013 China\u2019s position in the world economy is also dramatically different.\nAnd as explained by one of RBC\u2019s European mining analysts, Tyler Broda, this could have some serious short-term implications for Australian markets.\nBack in 2003, China consumed 35 per cent of the world\u2019s iron ore, while today it is about 70 per cent. It\u2019s an even more dramatic story in copper, where Chinese consumption has jumped from 20 per cent of the world\u2019s supply to 50 per cent.\nIt was miners' that were hammered in early Tuesday trade on the ASX, which was down 121 points or 1.7 per cent as investors feared the coronavirus will damage the Chinese economy.\nBroda\u2019s view is that this makes the short-term impacts of coronavirus greater than those of the SARS outbreak.\n\u201cIn our view, even a less virulent disease could create more impact than comparisons to 2003 and this appears to be what the copper and iron ore markets are telling us, down 7 per cent and 10 per cent respectively over the past five days.\u201d Advertisement\nOne of Broda\u2019s biggest concerns is what happens to the property sector, a key consumer of steel. With debt levels so high in the Chinese economy, there is a concern that a \u201cshock to economic activity, which may already be occurring with authorities now delaying end to the Chinese New Year holiday, could cause a financial stress event that might be particularly troublesome for the levered property sector\u201d.\nThe Chinese of course, know exactly how to respond to such potential shocks \u2013 prime the pump a bit more. Broda expects policymakers to pump money into infrastructure and property and boost liquidity to the economy, perhaps through emergency finance.\n\u201cThis will likely further erode the longer-term outlook but could allow for the sector to have a sharp recovery.\u201d\nBroda stresses the mining sector is in rude health, with balance sheets strong, costs lows and cashflow in good shape. This should buttress the share prices of companies such as BHP and Rio Tinto, even if they look certain to face some short-term volatility.\nThere are so many moving pieces here \u2013 starting with the spread of the virus in and outside China, and just how much the economy there has really stopped \u2013 that predictions are almost impossible.\nBut given global markets have started the year so strongly after a bumper year, the conditions for a pull back \u2013 or even a correction \u2013 are arguably in place.\nVolatility looks the only certainty for now.

Consider getting the seasonal flu shot. Drink plenty of fluids (water, hot soups etc. \u2013 stay hydrated). Avoid Caffeine. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for atleast 20 seconds; use an alcohol-based hand rub if soap and water are not available. Avoid frequently touching your nose, mouth and eyes. Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue, or cough and sneeze into your upper sleeve(s). Dispose of used tissues appropriately. It\u2019s also a good idea to disinfect/sanitize your immediate and common work surfaces including door knobs, keyboards and mice surfaces. Make disinfectant wipes available around the office for employees. Be careful not to get any liquid into the electronic parts! A desk clean-up will also ensure compliance with your company clean desk policy! If any employee experiences flu like symptoms that persist for more than 2-3 days or seem to be worsening, it is advisable to get it checked out by their doctor immediately . Remember to drink lots of fluids & avoid caffeine. In the unfortunate event that an employee does get sick, advise the employees to seek medical assistance immediately and ask that they stay at home to rest and recuperate. Avoid contact with loved ones or co-workers to avoid spreading the illness.\nFeeling sick after travel If you have an employee with symptoms of an existing medical condition, and these symptoms worsen while travelling, and they are still sick when they return to Canada: tell a flight attendant or a border services officer when you arrive so they can decide whether you need further medical assessment If you are sick after you return to Canada: see a health care provider immediately and tell them the countries you visited, and if you received medical care (for example, blood transfusions, injections, dental care or surgery) If you were sick while you were away: learn about travel advisories related to Wuhan novel coronavirus\nDo You Have An Affected Employee? If an employer has reason to believe an employee who has recently travelled to affected areas or has had close contact with someone who has Coronavirus-related symptoms, you should advise the employee to seek immediate medical attention. This may involve the employee notifying their physician or public health unit/department in advance to be directed to the appropriate emergency department or established virus centre. Please note that the employer is not legally required to report a suspected case of Coronavirus to a local Public Health Unit. The treating physican or medical practitioner will do so.

All of these deaths have been in China. The disease has spread to at least 16 other countries, including Canada , the USA , France, Germany, Finland, Australia, India, Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and a number of East Asian countries [ This is where Wuhan coronavirus cases have been confirmed worldwide , by Eric Cheung, CNN, January 30, 2020].\nThe Main Stream Media, in Western countries, is stoking panic with rolling news coverage on the spread of the possibly Apocalyptic new plague [ Corona Virus Outbreak , by Matthew Weaver et al., The Guardian, January 30, 2020]. But what nobody is openly reporting: the race of the victims. They appear to be all Asians\u2014specifically, the yellow race formerly known ( accurately but now Politically Incorrectly ) as \u201c Oriental .\u201d\nThus two Coronavirus cases were just confirmed in the U.K. [ Coronavirus: UK patient is University of York student , BBC,com, February 1, 2020], But if you read the article, both turn out to be \u201cChinese nationals.\u201d Similarly a recent headline of The Helsinki Times read \u201c First case of Wuhan Corona virus confirmed in Finland , \u201d [January 29, 2020]. But it turns out to be a Chinese tourist in Lapland, not a Finn.\nIn fact, as far as I can tell, all of the confirmed cases have been of Chinese people. According to Sri Lankan radio, the case in Sri Lanka was a \u201cChinese tourist\u201d [ Sri Lanka suspends visa on arrival for Chinese travellers after confirmed case of Corona virus , News On Air, January 28, 2020]. So are the cases in France and the one in the United Arab Emirates [ Coronavirus is spreading as FIVE people in France are now confirmed to have the illness and Chinese traveller from Wuhan is quarantined in Finland , by Sam Blanchard, Mail Online, January 29, 2020].\nIf it is true that only East Asians are dying of, or even catching, Corona, that would be consistent with long-established race differences in the susceptibility to such viruses. This has been explored in a fascinating study, by a group of Chinese researchers led by C. L. Chen of Soochow University, entitled: Ethnic differences in susceptibilities to A(H1N1) flu [ African Journal of Biotechnology, 2009].\nThe authors begin by noting that, from an evolutionary perspective, there is every reason to expect there to be ethnic or race differences in the susceptibility to different pathogens. Races\u2014or, as they call them, \u201cethnic groups\u201d\u2014are breeding populations, long-separated, usually by geography, who are, therefore, genetic clusters adapted to different ecologies. Because they were exposed to different pathogens in prehistory, there are very likely to be race differences in susceptibility to the pathogens and in how well the immune system can fight them.\nMany infectious diseases jumped the species barrier from animals to humans due to our close contact with animals while pursuing agriculture. For this reason, groups that never innovated agriculture, or who only innovated it in a limited form or only relatively recently took it up, can be decimated by flu-like viruses.\nThus the authors observe that the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1918 was three to 70 times more deadly to \u201c natives \u201d in Canada and the USA, as well as to the reindeer herding Saami people in Sweden and Norway, than it was to the rest of these countries\u2019 populations. This is because most white and black people are descended from those who have long practiced farming. The authors add that the Swine Flu Pandemic of 2009 was five times more deadly to Maori people than it was to other New Zealanders.\nThe Corona Virus is closely related to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) [ Coronavirus vs. SARS: Health experts on the key differences between the two outbreaks , by Sam Meredith, CNBC, January 28, 2020], of which there was a major outbreak in 2003 , which also began in China in 2002.\nAccording to Wikipedia (which is, presumably, politically neutral on such numbers), total of 774 people died across 29 countries. This amounted to almost 10% of those who caught it. Potentially in line with the findings of the Chinese researchers, the mortality rate for SARS in Europe was almost nil. Minuscule numbers of people caught it and only one of them died, in France (where there were an, atypically high, 7 cases).\nBy contrast, in Hong Kong the mortality rate from SARS was 17%. In Taiwan, it was 10%. In Canada, it was 17%, but it seems pretty obvious that they were all \u201c Chinese Canadians ,\u201d what with there being so many Chinese people in Canada and documented attempts made to \u201chelp\u201d them (specifically) deal with the virus [see Beyond SARS: ethnic community organization\u2019s role in public health \u2014a Toronto experience, By W. Dong, Promotion and Education, 2008].\nIn Singapore, 13% of those who caught SARS died out of 238 cases. Other countries had very small numbers of cases or, as with Vietnam, their medical access would have been sub-optimal, rendering it difficult to make comparisons.\nBut essentially it can be said the SARS was an East Asian disease which, like Corona, can be traced to bats. SARS didn\u2019t severely impact the rest of the world, despite people definitely catching it. It disproportionally killed East Asians. See SARS: The Immigration Dimension II , by Walter Pringle , VDARE.com, April 24, 2003.\nThis effect was so pronounced that, Wkipedia reports , \u201cMany Chinese believed that the SARS virus could be a biological weapon manufactured by the United States, which perceived China as a potential threat.\u201d (Ironically, the financial website ZeroHedge has just been banned by Twitter for reporting speculation that the Corona virus was developed during Chinese research into bioweapons\u2014a ban that ZeroHedge attributes in a scathing post to U.S. capitalists\u2019 notorious desire to appease China).\nThe difference between the two strains: the Corona virus, according to experts, is nothing like as deadly as SARS. Its mortality rate appears to be about 2% . It \u2018s mainly taking people with serious pre-existing health conditions [ Coronavirus vs. SARS: Health experts on the key differences between the two outbreaks , by Sam Meredith, CNBC, January 28, 2020].\nSo if I wanted to tempt fate, then I\u2019d write the following:\nThe Corona virus is a virus that, for whatever reason, East Asians are susceptible to but other races are not, just like SARS. None of our people are going to succumb to this condition. The MSM\u2019s constant hyping is just a way of making people panic, because people are more susceptible to being indoctrinated when they panic.\nBy not reporting the race of those who have caught this disease in Europe, unnecessary panic is being fomented among Europeans\u2026so that they can be more easily inculcated with the message than \u201crace differences don\u2019t exist, because race is a social construct.\u201d\nBut race differences do exist. Race is a biological reality. And these kinds of viruses help to prove that.",

The step was taken considering that the Bamboo Curtain country is now being hit by a corona virus outbreak.\nAs a result of the corona virus, a number of sports have been confirmed canceled or postponed. Until now, the F1 side has not yet decided on the next step, because the new race will take place in April.\nPreviously, the Formula E electric car race officially postponed its race in the Sanya area, China. F1 is expected to take similar steps if the corona virus still hasn't subsided. Brawn hopes to change his schedule to another date.\n\"I think the race will be postponed if it is not possible to take place in April. We open the option to move the date on another day, \"Brawn told Motorsports.\nPreviously it was rumored that the Chinese GP's date would be exchanged for another race. However, Brawn felt that was not possible, because every promoter of the host country had prepared a schedule.\n\"We will not exchange the dates for other races. \"We have to find a gap where the race can still be held at the end of the season,\" he said.\nThe former Scuderia Ferrari team boss hopes to be able to hold the Chinese Grand Prix. The reason, he considers China has an important market for F1. However, he claimed it would be difficult to do, if the corona virus never subsides.\n\"China is a growing market and has high enthusiasm. We want to keep racing in China. However, it seems to be difficult and we are still waiting for the final decision of the promoter in China and related authorities, \"said Brawn.",

        "content": "The basic structure of the latest coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is the same as that of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which broke out in China in 2003. Like the SARS virus, 2019-nCoV has been found to share the , Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).\nWhat has led some to suspect that these two viruses has been deliberately weaponized is a finding that Asian males have five times as many ACE2-expressing cells in their lungs as any other demographic. This line of inquiry is being on public chatboards for being \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d, which is absurd.\nThis echoes complaints by Chinese authorities of \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cxenophobic\u201d comments (like \u201cbat soup\u201d). They\u2019re calling for a shutdown of online discussion on the topic, for fear of causing \u201cmass-panic\u201d. Their appears to be succeeding at the task.\nAnother feature of 2019-nCoV that has raised suspicions of weaponization was described in from India submitted for peer review, that the same amino acid \u201cinsertions\u201d in the spike glycoprotein (S) as seen in the HIV-1 virus were present in 2019-nCoV but are not present in other coronaviruses.\nThe study stated that these \u201cinsertions\u201d are \u201cunlikely to be fortuitous in nature\u201d. The paper was hastily withdrawn by its authors, due to pressure, likely from the Chinese government.\nIn AIDS patients, these spike glycoproteins drop off the virus and plug into receptors on the intestinal wall, blocking the absorption of nutrients and causing the dramatic physical wasting that is a hallmark of AIDS.\nBioweapons expert, Dr. Francis Boyle is shown in this video saying, \u201cSARS, itself is already a biological warfare weapon and then they\u2026 supercharged it\u2026with DNA, genetic engineering of maybe synthetic biology to add in to SARS, HIV\u2026that our Indian study and the flu virus and then they gave it these gain-of-function activities.\u201d\nThe videos coming out of China are harrowing. People are being violently dragged away from their homes, to be taken to quarantine facilities. Alternately, the doors to apartment complexes are being welded shut, to prevent residents from exiting the buildings and spreading the disease.\nPhilippine Senate President, Tito Sotto showed a video suggesting that 2019-nCoV was a product of Bill Gates and the CIA. Many truthers have published similar stories; that the Pirbright Institute in the UK owns the 2019-nCoV patent and that Bill Gates is involved.\nIn response, a spokesperson for Pirbright, Teresa Maughan said that \u201cnot only does the patent in question not involve a coronavirus strain that affects humans, but the institute\u2019s work with the virus wasn\u2019t funded by the Gates Foundation.\u201d\nThe Pirbright Institute owns the patents for several coronaviruses that affect poultry and pigs. The CDC owns the patent for SARS, having sequenced the genome in 2003, at the time of the outbreak.\nOn January 24th, the Institut Pasteur in France announced that it had sequenced the genome of 2019-nCoV, which matched the one shared with them by Chinese authorities on January 11th. Presumably, it will be patented by the Chinese. ",

        "content": "The WHO has announced that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), first detected in Wuhan, is now a \u2018Public Health Emergency of International Concern\u2019. As of February 4, there are over 20,000 cases of 2019-nCoV confirmed globally, the vast majority within China.\nThere are reasons to remain positive, in no small part due to the Chinese government\u2019s highly proactive response. China quickly identified the virus and shared its sequence, allowing other countries to diagnose potential cases and introduce public health measures to prevent its spread.\nWe are also now seeing unprecedented containment measures. The lunar new year holiday has been extended and many businesses have halted or reduced operations in China. Domestic travel is severely curtailed. Internationally, visa and border entry restrictions on travellers departing or transiting through China are blunt but effective tools.\nJust what the global economy didn\u2019t need\nEstimating how much economic damage 2019-nCoV will inflict is difficult and will ultimately depend on the duration and severity of the outbreak.\nAgain, I think we can be cautiously optimistic. Despite a shaky start, the global containment of SARS took about three months. The far more rapid and robust response to 2019-nCoV raises hopes this can be bettered.\nIf so then we could see a modest impact on China\u2019s economy. But even factoring in relatively quick containment, we expect slower Q1 growth at 5.8% yoy before a notable rebound to 6% in Q2 and then a return to our previous slowing trajectory. In effect, our forecast for China\u2019s GDP growth in 2020 is unchanged at 5.8%.\nThis is bullish, and there are of course far more pessimistic forecasts. The China Academy of Social Sciences, which advises the State Council, has publicly discussed the potential for growth falling below 5% in Q1. This is a worst-case scenario and would be more damaging to the global economy.\nAssessing the impact on commodities\nAt the end of 2019, I raised my concerns that uncertainty over the Chinese economy would lead to increased commodity price volatility in 2020. Unsurprisingly, I\u2019m sticking with this as even a short-lived 2019-nCoV outbreak inevitably impacts energy demand and prices.\nTransportation grounded\nIt\u2019s kind of obvious but as containment is focused principally on restricting air travel and using public passenger transport, jet fuel, and to a lesser degree diesel and gasoline, are hit hardest.\nFor Q1 2020, our Oils team expects China\u2019s demand to decline by over 450,000 b/d versus 4Q 2019 (a 3.5% drop). February demand really suffers, but if containment starts to work by early Q2 then a strong rebound in demand is likely through early summer, as we saw post-SARS in 2003. Even with this, China\u2019s overall annual oil demand growth for 2020 has been revised downward by over 200,000 b/d from our early January outlook.\nThere\u2019s a lot of panic in the market right now, reflected in Brent\u2019s double-digit percentage drop through January. But I think things may not be as bad as some suggest. Talk of something like a 20% drop in Chinese oil demand is alarmist and risks skewing oil prices to the downside. Even if Chinese jet fuel demand were to drop to zero \u2013 which it won\u2019t \u2013 then this still only represents some 7% of the country\u2019s total oil demand.\nIndustrial output and consumption\nAs noted, an immediate impact of the 2019-nCoV outbreak has been workers not returning to their jobs. In Hubei province, factories and construction sites are dormant, while much of the rest of the country is only slowly returning to work.\nElectricity demand, already weakening through 2019, is on the ropes. Industry accounts for almost 70% of total power demand in China so closed factories will hit demand hard. By the end of January, peak power load in Hubei province dropped to 22.5 GW, some 21% lower than planned.\nWeaker power demand and industrial activity inevitably impact both domestic production and consumption of thermal coal. Imports are also expected to slow, with reports of Indonesian producers already being asked to delay loadings. The effect on prices though is likely to be muted; prices fell so much through 2019 that globally many producers are already operating at negative margins.\nEven prior to the outbreak, the pace of China\u2019s gas demand growth was tumbling. Much of this was due to the slowing economy. Given that 60% of Chinese gas demand comes from power and industry, 2019-nCoV is impacting the gas market at a time of underlying weakness.\nMedia reports suggest China\u2019s LNG buyers could declare force majeure on contracted cargoes. This is possible as contracts often include epidemics as a trigger and the government has reportedly offered companies FM certificates. LNG demand has fallen off a cliff since January (an LNG trader just told me Chinese demand has \u2018disappeared\u2019) and buyers will be looking at all options. Force majeure could provide relief for Chinese buyers but should always be considered an option of last resort.\nThe importance of staying positive\nAnalysts are scrambling to understand the impact of 2019-nCoV, with all sorts of outcomes being considered. The next few weeks will be crucial in determining whether the outbreak can be controlled. But containment is achievable and with continued efforts, should limit the worst of the impact. Let\u2019s stay positive.\nBest wishes to all those affected and to those working to contain and prevent the spread of the virus.",

According to 2018 report of MPEDA (Marine Products Export Development Authority), India exported sea food (fish predominantly) worth of 6,923 million USD and imported 138 million USD. USA is the predominant import destination of India according to MPEDA. Import of sea food from other countries is miniscule or negligent. As far as China is considered, Japan is its leading importer of sea food from China, followed by USA, Hong Kong and Korea.\nThough chances are minimal, India is preparing itself to encounter the situation.",

        "content": "The oil price used to spike upwards at the first sign of global fear. But times have changed. As a commodity, oil remains essential to modern life and economic welfare. However, its production is now more geographically dispersed than ever before. The US is a net exporter of oil. No longer is the middle east, and the Persian Gulf in particular, the most important part of a world that relies on oil for energy.\nNot many years ago, the emergence of the Corona virus would most likely have seen a surge in oil prices. Today, we are more likely to see a significant drop. The reason for this is China\u2019s reaction to virus containment. Life is not normal there at present. Economic activity has been reduced, deliberately so, to avoid virus transmission and the results will soon be obvious. The demand for oil in China is falling rapidly.\nA falling oil price is likely to be welcomed by the consumer at the petrol pump. It may give countries that hold limited reserve supplies opportunity to increase those reserves. But it will not be good for oil producers as margins are squeezed. China\u2019s economy has been generating so much growth for over 20 years now that many other countries are heavily connected through supply and demand chains. Those trade arrangements are going to be hurt by a recession in China. Where a fall in costs of a production factor such as oil would usually spur demand, in a world of enforced quarantines of Chinese citizens there won\u2019t be any additional demand.\nCrude oil prices are down about 15% during January 2020. OPEC, in normal fashion, has announced it will reduce supply, but perhaps the power of OPEC has peaked. ",

It will synthesize and test up to 100 molecules using its own resources and the resources generously offered by its closest partners, to contribute to the global effort. The rest of the structures are published on the company website with the annotation submitted to the bioRxiv preprint server. By making these structures available to the general public, Insilico hopes those who are interested in finding a potential treatment for this viral infection could synthesize and test these molecules.\nThe generated molecules are published at https://ncov-sprint/ and will be continuously updated.\nOne of the bottlenecks in AI-powered drug discovery is the ability to synthesize and test the molecules quickly. Advanced generative chemistry approaches allow for many diverse molecular structures to be designed with a variety of properties as generation conditions. However, synthesis and validation may take some time and could require substantial resources. Therefore, Insilico Medicine selected up to 100 molecules to be synthesized and tested, with the rest of the generated structures deposited on the website.\nFor synthesis and screening Insilico joined forces with many functions of the largest international open research platform, and the company will make its staff and resources available to support drug discovery process to contribute to the global fight against this new health threat.\n\"During this difficult time, every promising approach must be used to expedite the drug discovery efforts against 2019-nCoV, including utilizing the generative chemistry part of our end-to-end drug discovery pipeline. We encourage medicinal chemists to evaluate the generated molecules, provide their feedback and consider them for synthesis. Our team will also synthesize and test several of the generated compounds.\" said Alex Zhavoronkov, PhD, CEO of Insilico Medicine. ###\nAbout Insilico Medicine\nInsilico Medicine is an artificial intelligence company with offices in six countries and regions striving to accelerate three areas of drug discovery and development: disease target identification, generation of novel molecules (generative chemistry) and synthetic biological data (generative biology), and prediction of clinical trial outcomes. The Company was the first to apply the generative adversarial networks (GANs) and reinforcement learning (RL) to generate new molecular structures with the specified parameters in 2015. In addition to collaborating with large pharmaceutical companies, Insilico Medicine is also pursuing internal drug discovery programs in different disease areas.",

This is the combined effect of policies for containment and public fear of infection. Many people have decided to stay in their own homes and few people are still willing to go out for shopping. Fruit in particular is not a necessity, so only a small number of people is willing to go out and buy fruit. Some companies resumed operations in the last few days and we also received some orders from supermarkets, but we do not have enough workers, so we find it difficult to keep up with our delivery targets. Offline sales are quite slow, but online sales remain at a regular level. However, because the holidays are extended and many warehouses have not yet resumed operations, many of our orders are still waiting to be processed.\"\nThe corona virus did not just affect sales conditions in the domestic fruit market. The export industry felt the impact as well. Manager Sun works at a frozen fruit and vegetable export company. According to her, \"although most foreign traders can work from home, the physical product processing aspect of business requires people to gather in groups. We expect to resume business on February 9th. Many of the export orders have been delayed.\"\nA ginger exporter from Shandong stated the following: \"We had planned to ship three containers full of ginger before the 15th of January, but now we are forced to halt our operations. We are unable to deliver our products on time.\"\nThe balance between supply and demand in the international market is disturbed because China is unable to deliver on time. This in turn has a chain effect on overseas markets. One frozen garlic supplier explained the situation: \"In addition to several reasons for delayed delivery, there is also a reduction in the number of overseas orders. The price soared in the last few days. Clients with products are able to make a sizable profit.\"\nReports show that the prices of fresh ginger and garlic in the market of Pakistan increased fourfold. Although Russia did not completely prohibit all Chinese fruit and vegetable import, they did severely restrict import from China, which massively reduced the volume of Chinese fruit and vegetables in the Russian market. Still, the few products there are already twice as expensive in comparison with several weeks ago. Many Russian importers are looking for suppliers from other countries to replace Chinese imports.",

After the app is registered on the phone, users are asked to enter their name and ID number. The status of three other ID numbers can then be checked with each registered phone, Xinhua reported.\nThe report did not provide information on how to determine exposure through the app, but defines the close contact when someone who does not provide effective protection comes in close proximity to someone who has or shows signs of coronavirus symptoms.\nThe definition includes people who work closely together, share a classroom or live in the same house, as well as medical personnel who work with coronavirus patients and local passengers, where a patient or a potential patient was present.\nThe app was developed jointly by the General Office of the State Council, the National Health Commission and China Electronics Technology Group Corporations with the support of several Chinese government departments.The disease was first reported to the World Health Organization on New Year's Eve and in the intervening weeks has been associated with a known family of viruses: coronaviruses, the same family responsible for SARS and MERS, and some cases of colds.

Asians Far More Susceptible to Corona Virus than Other Races, More Likely to Die, Just Like SARS [VIDEO] Asians Far More Susceptible to Corona Virus than Other Races, More Likely to Die, Just Like SARS\nIn support of Lance Welton\u2019s thesis below, that the coronavirus seems particularly aimed at Chinese people or, at least, that they seem to be the main victims of it \u2013 just like SARS, we link to an Al Jazeera report of 8 hours ago titled China coronavirus outbreak: All the latest updates \u2013 Global death toll reaches 427 with two reported dead outside mainland China as the number of infections passes 20,500 . Simply from the title itself, we can see that by far and away the largest % of deaths are among Chinese in China. One of the 2 dead \u2018outside of China\u2019, the second death in fact, is from Hong Kong , as reported in the first two paragraphs, meaning this person is racially, genetically Chinese. (A note to Al Jazeera : Hong Kong has been \u2018inside\u2019 of China politically since 1997. Further, it is not an island and is part of the mainland, although it contains several islands.)\nThis CNN story, linked to here (from Feb.3), reports on the first death due to the coronavirus of a Chinese man in the Philippines .\nWhy are we not being told this? Why, as per usual, are we being made to fear? Welton attempts to answer this below.\nCredit to Paul Craig Roberts , who has alerted his readers to a Youtube video testifying to the fact that viruses can be targeted at populations with a certain racial/genetic profile. These racial profiles, or \u2018genetic markers\u2019, can easily be identified, thus enabling the production of bioweapons targeting certain people. Says Roberts, \u2018For those who doubt that bioweapons can be targeted to specific races or ethnicities, here is a documentary describing how it is done\u2019. We\u2019re posting it below (starting at 41 mins, 20 seconds ):\nDo You Know All Coronavirus Victims Appear To Be Chinese? Thought Not! LANCE WELTON\nAt the time of writing, 170 people have died of the Wuhan Coronavirus [ Coronavirus Live Updates: Death Toll Rises, as Foreigners are Evacuated , New York Times, January 30, 2020], though that number is bound to have increased by the time this article is published.\nAll of these deaths have been in China.\nThe disease has spread to at least 16 other countries, including Canada , the USA , France, Germany, Finland, Australia, India, Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and a number of East Asian countries [ This is where Wuhan coronavirus cases have been confirmed worldwide , by Eric Cheung, CNN, January 30, 2020]. The Main Stream Media, in Western countries, is stoking panic with rolling news coverage on the spread of the possibly Apocalyptic new plague [ Corona Virus Outbreak , by Matthew Weaver et al., The Guardian, January 30, 2020]. But what nobody is openly reporting: the race of the victims. They appear to be all Asians \u2014specifically, the yellow race formerly known ( accurately but now Politically Incorrectly ) as \u201c Oriental .\u201d\nThus two Coronavirus cases were just confirmed in the U.K. [ Coronavirus: UK patient is University of York student , BBC.com, February 1, 2020], But if you read the article, both turn out to be \u201cChinese nationals.\u201d Similarly a recent headline of The Helsinki Times read \u201c First case of Wuhan Corona virus confirmed in Finland , \u201d [January 29, 2020]. But it turns out to be a Chinese tourist in Lapland, not a Finn.\nIn fact, as far as I can tell, all of the confirmed cases have been of Chinese people. According to Sri Lankan radio, the case in Sri Lanka was a \u201cChinese tourist\u201d [ Sri Lanka suspends visa on arrival for Chinese travellers after confirmed case of Corona virus , News On Air, January 28, 2020]. So are the cases in France and the one in the United Arab Emirates [ Coronavirus is spreading as FIVE people in France are now confirmed to have the illness and Chinese traveller from Wuhan is quarantined in Finland , by Sam Blanchard, Mail Online, January 29, 2020].\nIf it is true that only East Asians are dying of, or even catching, Corona, that would be consistent with long-established race differences in the susceptibility to such viruses. This has been explored in a fascinating study, by a group of Chinese researchers led by C. L. Chen of Soochow University, entitled: Ethnic differences in susceptibilities to A(H1N1) flu [ African Journal of Biotechnology, 2009].\nThe authors begin by noting that, from an evolutionary perspective, there is every reason to expect there to be ethnic or race differences in the susceptibility to different pathogens . Races\u2014or, as they call them, \u201cethnic groups\u201d\u2014are breeding populations, long-separated, usually by geography, who are, therefore, genetic clusters adapted to different ecologies. Because they were exposed to different pathogens in prehistory, there are very likely to be race differences in susceptibility to the pathogens and in how well the immune system can fight them.\nMany infectious diseases jumped the species barrier from animals to humans due to our close contact with animals while pursuing agriculture. For this reason, groups that never innovated agriculture, or who only innovated it in a limited form or only relatively recently took it up, can be decimated by flu-like viruses.\nThus the authors observe that the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1918 was three to 70 times more deadly to \u201c natives \u201d in Canada and the USA, as well as to the reindeer herding Saami people in Sweden and Norway, than it was to the rest of these countries\u2019 populations. This is because most white and black people are descended from those who have long practiced farming. The authors add that the Swine Flu Pandemic of 2009 was five times more deadly to Maori people than it was to other New Zealanders.\nThe Corona Virus is closely related to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) [ Coronavirus vs. SARS: Health experts on the key differences between the two outbreaks , by Sam Meredith, CNBC, January 28, 2020], of which there was a major outbreak in 2003 , which also began in China in 2002.\nAccording to Wikipedia (which is, presumably, politically neutral on such numbers), a total of 774 people died across 29 countries. This amounted to almost 10% of those who caught it. Potentially in line with the findings of the Chinese researchers, the mortality rate for SARS in Europe was almost nil. Minuscule numbers of people caught it and only one of them died \u2013 in France (where there were an atypically high 7 cases).\nBy contrast, in Hong Kong the mortality rate from SARS was 17% . In Taiwan, it was 10% . In Canada, it was 17% , but it seems pretty obvious that they were all \u201c Chinese Canadians ,\u201d what with there being so many Chinese people in Canada and documented attempts made to \u201chelp\u201d them (specifically) deal with the virus [see Beyond SARS: ethnic community organization\u2019s role in public health \u2014a Toronto experience, By W. Dong, Promotion and Education, 2008].\nIn Singapore , 13% of those who caught SARS died out of 238 cases. Other countries had very small numbers of cases or, as with Vietnam, their medical access would have been sub-optimal, rendering it difficult to make comparisons.\nBut essentially, it can be said the SARS was an East Asian disease which, like Corona, can be traced to bats. SARS didn\u2019t severely impact the rest of the world, despite people definitely catching it. It disproportionally killed East Asians. See SARS: The Immigration Dimension II , by Walter Pringle , VDARE.com, April 24, 2003.\nThis effect was so pronounced that, Wikipedia reports , \u201cMany Chinese believed that the SARS virus could be a biological weapon manufactured by the United States, which perceived China as a potential threat.\u201d (Ironically, the financial website ZeroHedge has just been banned by Twitter for reporting speculation that the Corona virus was developed during Chinese research into bioweapons\u2014a ban that ZeroHedge attributes in a scathing post to U.S. capitalists\u2019 notorious desire to appease China).\nThe difference between the two strains: the Corona virus, according to experts, is nothing like as deadly as SARS. Its mortality rate appears to be about 2% . It\u2018s mainly taking people with serious pre-existing health conditions [ Coronavirus vs. SARS: Health experts on the key differences between the two outbreaks , by Sam Meredith, CNBC, January 28, 2020].\nSo if I wanted to tempt fate, then I\u2019d write the following:\nThe Corona virus is a virus that, for whatever reason, East Asians are susceptible to but other races are not, just like SARS. None of our people are going to succumb to this condition. The MSM\u2019s constant hyping is just a way of making people panic, because people are more susceptible to being indoctrinated when they panic. By not reporting the race of those who have caught this disease in Europe, unnecessary panic is being fomented among Europeans \u2026so that they can be more easily inculcated with the message than \u201crace differences don\u2019t exist, because race is a social construct.\u201d But race differences do exist. Race is a biological reality. And these kinds of viruses help to prove that.",

        "content": "While Google searches for \"Corona beer virus\" have spiked, there is no connection between the beverage and the virus. By Viber\nThe virus that has been plaguing Wuhan , China and has been slowly infecting 28 more countries worldwide just had its official name: COVID 19. As of date, there are almost 45,000 infected in mainland China, and daily deaths have been continuously recorded. There are a lot of questions that have to be answered, slowly the WHO organization and other countries expedite the vaccine for the prevention of such disease. Reports say that the vaccine will be ready in 8 months, till then, all we have to do is to protect ourselves by knowing the basics and debunk myths related to the virus. Here are the 14 most common myths that should be answered:\n1. Can the Virus be medically treated with specific medications?\nNot yet. The 2019 nCoV is relatively new , and there is still no specific medication that can treat the virus directly. This means it is like other viruses that are self-limiting. This does not mean that those that receive the treatment do not need special or appropriate care. Doctors usually treat the symptoms to keep the patient comfortable. The immune system is also supported by proper hydration and nutrition. There are specific treatments that are under investigation and are still for clinical trials in the future. The WHO organization and the local authorities funded by governments are helping to get fast results.\n2. Can Doctors Prescribe antibiotics in the treatment of nCoV?\nNo. Viruses do not respond to antibiotics. Antibiotics are only effective with bacteria. Antibiotics are also not effective when used as a prevention method. Though, some patients receive antibiotics not as a viral treatment but as treatment with secondary infections that may cause several similar symptoms as that of the virus.\n3. Are the young ones and the old ones more susceptible?\nNo matter what age you are, you can be infected with the virus (2019 nCoV). Older people though with a preexisting medical condition have a higher susceptibility to the virus. Especially those with conditions like diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory diseases. There are countless middle-aged men and women infected but there are also several confirmed cases in children, especially below 2 years old in China. This means that age is not a determinant of susceptibility. The World Health Organization firmly advise men and women of all ages to practice precaution and perform protection by doing proper hand hygiene including good respiratory hygiene.\n4. Does Sesame oil helps in Blocking the Virus?\nNo. Sesame oil serves no purpose in eradicating or even weaken the virulence of nCoV. There are proven methods though that can kill the virus, this includes the use of surface disinfectants like bleach and chlorine-based solutions. Alcohol with 70 to 75 percent concentration can also help when used as hand rub or surface disinfectant.\n5. Can Garlic consumption make a difference?\nSome say that garlic has potent antibiotic property , however, this is not fully understood yet. There is also no evidence that during this outbreak, patients who consume more garlic have different or better outcomes. Though garlic is considered nutritious and useful.\n6. If I gargle mouthwash almost all the time, will that protect me from the nCov?\nNo. To ensure that certain claims are valid and true, it must be evidence-based. Sadly, mouthwash is not backed up with evidence as of this time. There are brands and concentrations though that can help in one way or another in eliminating superficial bacteria in the mouth, giving you fresh breath all day. This does not mean though that you are protected from the Novel virus.\n7. Can irrigating my nose with the use of SALINE solution help in eliminating the virus?\nNo. As mentioned in the latter statement, there should be solid evidence to accept a certain theory. Irrigating your nose may give you clear sinuses and better breathing but it is not effective on eliminating the virus when attached to your nasal mucosa. There are several claims though that saline flushing can alleviate the symptoms of the common cold, this does not mean it can correct respiratory infections.\n8. Can I get a shot of Pneumonia Vaccine for protection from nCoV?\nNo. Pneumococcal vaccines such as Pneumonia and Influenza and any other vaccines available in the market right now does not provide direct protection form nCoV. The only recommended teaching to get enough rest, plenty of water for hydration and good nutrition. NCov is too novel or new for researchers to produce an immediate vaccine for it. Even if a vaccine is already created for the virus, the manufacturers will have the hardest time in trying to supply half a dozen countries that are positive with the coronavirus.\n9. Can my pet dog or cat acquire and spread the virus at home?\nThere are no reported cases of cats nor dogs infected with the virus and the transmission of which from the pets to humans or vise versa. Though proper practice in hand hygiene and can go a long way in preventing this from happening.\n10. Will I get infected if I receive a package from Wuhan?\nNo. People who are receiving and sending packages have no risk at all in getting infected with the nCoV. The virus does not last long on surfaces like envelopes and packages. This is according to their latest analysis. Any changes in the analysis can be managed still by hand hygiene.\n11. Will I get disinfected if someone sprays alcohol all over my body?\nNo. Disinfectants are effective on surfaces but not on infections that are already inside the body. Some cities practice spraying alcohol to all passengers that routes are definitive for the coronavirus. This can irritate human sinuses and mucous membranes aside from form, it can ruin your outfit of the day.\n12. Are the thermal scanners I am seeing on TV are effective?\nYes. The gadget captures real time temperature of clients. Though this gadget cannot detect a person who is specifically infected with the virus. The gadget can identify early symptoms such as temperature level, which is indicative of common flu and the coronavirus. But it should be noted that the person is infected even without symptoms, according to the World Health Organization, it would take 2 to 10 days before people show febrile symptoms when they become infected.\n13. Can UV lamps be effective in the eradication of the Virus?\nUV lamps should never be used in disinfecting the skin , it can cause severe irritation than may be harmful. Simple hand washing that lasts for at least 20 seconds can help in preventing the spread of the virus as well as cough etiquette.\n14. Can Hand dryers remove the virus on my skin surface?\nNo. any sort of drying equipment does not help at all, that includes hand dryers. Washing hands with soap and water is still the single most effective way of preventing disease transmission. Once hands are washed and cleaned, using hand towels or tissue to dry is enough.\nKnowing more is an advantage to anyone in these dire days. Up to date, there are already more than 1000 deaths recorded in China because of the Novel Coronavirus. The country is in a struggle, but they have been consistent on one thing, and that is their preparedness. Knowing the myths from the truth will not only prepare you but give you that control over your daily life.",

        "content": "This Government\u2019s key message has been its ability get things done, whether it be Brexit, HS2 or stopping the spread of Coronavirus.\nIndeed, if the new high speed trains move as swiftly as the Health Secretary did on Monday, then they might break the sound barrier: the were enacted at 6.50am on Monday and laid before Parliament by 2.30 that afternoon. Their preamble states that\nthe Secretary of State is of the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make this instrument without a draft having been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House of Parliament.\nOne can appreciate the desire to bypass the cumbersome mechanics of Parliament to save the country from a potentially deadly virus. But in the fullness of time, the resulting Regulations might well be held up as an excellent advertisement for Parliamentary scrutiny.\nThe enabling Act\nSecondary (or subordinate) legislation \u2013 such as regulations \u2013 is made by the executive under powers granted by \u2018enabling\u2019 primary legislation.\nThe enabling legislation cited in these Regulations is the . And its use in this case might be said to be straight out of 1984 .\nThe Coronavirus Regulations apply where the Secretary of State has issued a \u201c serious and imminent threat declaration\u201d , which he also managed to do on Monday. They extend to England only.\nThe Regulations purport to derive their basis in law from specific sections of the 1984 Act: sections 45B, C, F and P. The first two of those sections merit a closer look.\nis entitled \u201c Health Protection Regulations: international travel etc. \u201d It provides that the appropriate minister may by regulations make provision:\na. for preventing danger to public health from vessels, aircraft, trains or other conveyances arriving at any place,\nb. for preventing the spread of infection or contamination by means of any vessel, aircraft, train or other conveyance leaving any place, and\nc. for giving effect to any international agreement or arrangement relating to the spread of infection or contamination.\nAmong the non-exhaustive list of measures envisaged by sub-section 1 are provisions \u201c for the medical examination, detention, isolation or quarantine of persons. \u201d So in the context of \u201c international travel etc. \u201d, those coercive powers can clearly be the subject of Regulations.\ndeals with a separate context \u2013 it is entitled \u201c Health protection regulations: domestic \u201d. Section 45C(1) provides:\nThe appropriate Minister may by regulations make provision for the purpose of preventing against, controlling or providing a public health response to the incidence or spread of infection or contamination in England and Wales (whether from risks originating there or elsewhere).\nThis would plainly encompass controlling the spread in England of a Coronavirus originating elsewhere.\nThis section has its own non-exhaustive list, which contains apparently less coercive measures than the international travel section does. The 45C list includes requiring medical practitioners to record and notify cases or suspected cases of infection or contamination, and keeping children away from school.\nprovides that the restrictions or requirements envisaged can include \u201c a special restriction or requirement \u201d. This is defined as a restriction or requirement which can be imposed by a justice of the peace under various provisions, including section 45G(2). These, in turn, include detention, isolation and quarantine, as a footnote to the 2020 Regulations points out.\nHowever, the power to make regulations under section 45C(1) is subject to Not only does section 45C not expressly contain any power of detention, isolation or quarantine, section 45D(3) states that Regulations under section 45C \u201c may not include provision imposing a special restriction or requirement mentioned in section 45G(2)(a), (b), (c) or (d).\u201d refers to a restriction or requirement \u201c that P be detained in a hospital or other suitable establishment \u201d, and 45G(2)(d) refers to a restriction or requirement \u201c that P be kept in isolation or quarantine\u201d.\nSo that is what the primary legislation says. In summary, it makes clear that in the domestic context of disease control (as opposed to the international travel context) there is no power to make regulations imposing detention, isolation or quarantine on any person.\nThe Coronavirus Regulations\nThe secondary legislation provides at that the Secretary of State or a registered public health consultant (i.e. a professionally registered public health consultant working within public health England) may, for the purposes of screening, assessment and the imposition of any restrictions or requirements under impose on a person a requirement to be detained for 48 hours, or as long as it takes for any screening requirements and the assessment under Regulation 5 to be complied with. So this initial detention for screening purpose might be 48 hours, but it could be longer.\nWhile the emergency Regulations have been described by Government as designed \u201c to make it easier for health professionals to do their jobs \u201d, it could be Matt Hancock making the diagnosis as to whether detention is required. Indeed, under the Regulations there is no reason in principle why a person could not be detained in circumstances where health professionals determined that the test for detention was not met, but where a Minister disagreed with that expert medical assessment.\nDetention is subject to the existence of one of two conditions \u2013 A or B: Condition A is that the Secretary of State or the registered public health consultant has reasonable grounds to believe that the person is, or may be, infected or contaminated with Coronavirus and considers that there is a risk that they might infect or contaminate others. There is no reference to them having recently travelled to England. This appears, therefore, to fall within the \u2018domestic\u2019 section of the 1984 Act \u2013 section 45C. Condition B is linked to travel, and therefore appears to fall within section 45B of the Act: the person has arrived in England on an aircraft, ship or train from outside the UK (including via one of the other countries in the UK) and has left or the Secretary of State/public health consultant has reasonable grounds to believe has left an infected area within 14 days of their arrival in England.\nIf Condition A or B is satisfied then this entitles the Secretary of State or the consultant to impose more screening requirements or carry out an assessment of the person: Regulation 5(1)(a) and (b).\nHowever, the existence of one of those conditions also engages an extraordinarily wide power, because the Secretary of State/the consultant may\nfollowing such an assessment, (orally or in writing) impose on or in relation to P [the person] any other restriction or requirement which the Secretary of State or, as the case may be, a registered public health consultant considers necessary for the purposes of removing or reducing the risk [of onward infection/contamination], including a special restriction or requirement.\nA \u201c special restriction or requirement \u201d is defined as including one contained in section 45G(2) of the 1984 Act and which can be imposed by a justice of the peace, including detention or isolation. This might appear to be in direct conflict with the enabling legislation, although as David Lawson points out, the Regulations probably rely on the distinction in section 45D(5) between \u201c actually imposing quarantine and enabling a decision which imposes quarantine \u2013 the regulations allow quarantine to be imposed and do not directly impose it .\u201d\nAnother far-reaching power is found at : where Condition A or B is met, further requirements may be imposed where considered necessary or proportionate. Some of those measures are fairly innocuous, for example, providing contact details to a public health officer. But they also include a requirement to \u201c comply with any other specified condition or to take any other specified measure\u201d.\nIsolation is addressed separately at . Again, where Condition A or Condition B is satisfied, the Secretary of State or a public health consultant may require P to be kept in isolation where they have reasonable grounds to believe that P is or may be infected or contaminated with Coronavirus, and considers that it is necessary and proportionate to isolate them in order to reduce or remove the infection/contamination risk. P is provided with the vague reassurance that \u201c the Secretary of State must have due regard to P\u2019s well-being.\u201d\nThere are further powers for police officers ( ), including to send and keep people in hospital \u201c or other suitable place \u201d (not defined). Here, neither condition A or B needs to be satisfied. It is enough that the constable has reasonable grounds to suspect that P \u201c is, or may be, infected with Coronavirus\u2026 there is a risk that P might infect or contaminate others\u201d and \u201cit is necessary to direct, remove or detain P in the interests of P, for the protection of other persons or for the maintenance of public safety.\u201d\nAgain, these police powers \u2013 insofar as they apply outside the international travel context \u2013 appear to involve the exercise of powers envisaged under section 45G(2)(a) to (d), which are expressly excluded from the requirements that regulations can directly impose in the domestic context, and so the Government would presumably rely again on the distinction between imposing a requirement and enabling someone else to impose it.\nConclusions\nOne would expect that case-by-case detentions or isolations might generate judicial review challenges as to their proportionality. And Regulation 5(4) appears to envisage the detention of children, which could present its own issues in individual cases.\nThere might also be a difficulty in the Secretary of State\u2019s adoption of two apparently contradictory positions when enacting the Regulations. On the one hand, he issued a that\nthe incidence or transmission of Coronavirus constitutes a serious and imminent threat to public health, and that the incidence or transmission of Coronavirus is at such a point that the measures outlined in these Regulations may reasonably be considered as an effective means of preventing the further, significant transmission of Coronavirus .\nThis form of words was necessary in order to enable the imposition of special restrictions or requirements: section 45D(4)(a), 1984 Act.\nYet on the same day he that:\nClinical advice has not changed about the risk to the public, which remains moderate. We are taking a belt and braces approach to all necessary precautions to ensure public safety .\nCan the threat to public health be serious, imminent and moderate all at the same time? That dichotomy could raise questions as to whether the exercise of powers of isolation and detention are rational. \u201c Belt and braces \u201d is hard to square with the language of reasonable necessity adopted by the courts when assessing proportionality. Section 45D(4) places restrictions on the power to make regulations under section 45C: \u201c Regulations under section 45C may not include provision enabling the imposition of a special restriction or requirement unless (a) the regulations are made in response to a serious and imminent threat to public health, or (b) the imposition of the restriction or requirement is expressed to be contingent on there being such a threat ay the time when it is imposed.\u201d\nThese Regulations are effective now not only despite the Secretary of State describing the risk as moderate, but also despite the UK Chief Medical Officers agreeing with that assessment and adding \u201c But the risk to individuals remains low.\u201d\nAnd the language used in introducing these measures suggests a relaxed approach to legality: the Department of Health described the announcement of \u201c serious and imminent threat \u201d as \u201c a legal term \u2026 as part of changes to make it easier for health professionals to do their job.\u201d This might suggest that the reference to a \u201c serious and imminent threat to public health \u201d is little more than an artificial work-around.\nWhy get hung up on the legal niceties?\nWell, aside from the importance of the Rule of Law, there is a practical consequence of subordinate legislation being ultra vires : as Lord Irvine explained in [1999] 2 AC 143 at 158, it means that the legislation \u201c is unlawful simpliciter and, if the presumption in favour of its legality is overcome by a litigant before a court of competent jurisdiction, is of no legal effect whatsoever \u201d.\nJim Duffy is a barrister at 1 Crown Office Row.\n",

However, fast the Corona virus is spreading, the impact is spreading faster and wider. Fear, especially combined with government travel bans, is a powerful deterrent to tourism.\u201d\nThe Chinese authorities issued a ban on sales of all outbound travel packages on 24 January 2020 encouraging travel organizers to urge their clients to boycott travel. A total ban on group travel was instigated as of 27 January 2020.\nThe Golden week surrounding the Chinese New Year is an important time for business during a low-season period.\n\u201cWe estimate that about 7% of all annual outbound tourism from China takes place during the Chinese New Year was due to leave China before the travel ban took place on the 27th of January; but the evolving situation led to approximately 60% of the groups being cancelled. So, with caution, it is possible that two-thirds of the visitors expected to arrive in Europe over this period have not done so,\u201d said Tom Jenkins.\n\u201cThese are last minute cancellations \u2013 some within twenty-four hours \u2013 releasing space when there is little alternative demand\u201d added Jenkins.\n\u201cWe also need to stress that Europe \u2013 and the UK will continue to be viewed as part of Europe by long haul markets \u2013 remains virtually free of Corona virus.

        "content": "Fear of the dreaded virus keeps people away from delicious dish\nThough a cross section of public in the tail-end Chittoor district are familiar with the dreaded coronavirus and its threat since a week, its immediate impact on the commercial front is felt on the sea fish trade. At the fish markets in the urban areas, including the municipalities of Chittoor, Puttur, Nagari, and Srikalahasti, stocks of sea fish has gone dry since Sunday. The fish traders term it a \u2018sudden development\u2019, and that they are yet to understand its ramifications fully.\nA rich variety of sea fish regularly finds its way to the urban fish markets in Chittoor district from Chennai\u2019s fishing harbour and surrounding villages. The stocks would pour in considerably large quantities on Sundays and Wednesdays. The varieties of \u2018vanjaram\u2019 and \u2018sora\u2019 would dominate the market, selling like hotcake. Some families, who believe in the health benefits of sea fish, hardly miss visiting the market a single day. It is estimated that the tail-end district would make a monthly business of about 30 tonnes of sea fish.\nThe traders at Satyavedu, Srikalahasti, Varadaiahpalem, B.N. Kandriga and Nagalapuram mandals get stocks from the Pulicat Lake and Tada in the neighbouring Nellore district, apart from the TN villages abutting the lake and the Bay of Bengal. Close to 100 families from Satyavedu and Varadaiahpalem mandals are involved in selling sea fish in the eastern mandals. Coming to Puttur, Nagari, Tirupati, and Chittoor markets, the supply comes from Chennai in trains and trucks. Small quantum of sea fish would further reach Madanapalle, Kuppam, Palamaner, and Piler in the western side.\nOn Wednesday, sea fish went literally missing from the urban markets. The traders were forced to keep small quantum of sea fish at some corners, hoping to sell them but in vain. Fearing to place sea fish and local fish (from village tanks) together on display at the markets, the traders soon removed the former. Potential carrier\nBabu, a senior fish merchant at Puttur market, said that fear psychosis has gripped the fish consumers that sea fish could be the potential carrier of the coronavirus all way from the shores of China to the Bay of Bengal and beyond. \u201cFor the next one month, the people would not be in a position to dare purchase the sea fish. We had procured some stocks last week from Chennai, but could not sell much due to Republic Day on Sunday. We have a small quantum left now, and we are ready to abandon the same. In view the present threat of coronavirus, we too can\u2019t make business with it,\u201d he said.\nComing to the rural markets, the sea fish business is yet to face any bigger threat. \u201cWhile the educated families stopped coming to us, our regular customers are not bothered about the threats of the virus spread through sea fish,\u201d said a woman fish merchant at Varadaiahpalem.\nMeanwhile, the local fish varieties from village tanks and reservoirs have flooded the fish markets elsewhere in the district, with the traders hoping to cash in on \u2018nil or the lowest\u2019 sales of sea fish due to coronavirus threat. In spite of the availability of the fresh water fish, still the people are taking a back step in the urban areas, while the impact of coronavirus threat is yet to reach the rural belt.",

        "content": "2019-nCoV, a New Threat and Exemplary Action by the Chinese Authorities Prabir Purkayastha\nIN two months, the novel coronavirus\u2014or 2019-nCoV\u2014has affected more people than the SARS virus had done in 2002-2003. While it is spreading faster, it is more infectious than SARS, the infections are less severe: the numbers of people becoming seriously ill or dying are less than with SARS. The Chinese authorities have reported 7,711 confirmed cases as of January 30th, of which 170 people have died of the disease. The bulk of the infections are from the Hubei province, with Wuhan as the epicentre of the outbreak.\nWhile there are various doomsday predictions of this epidemic, the Chinese authorities have acted with exemplary speed and taken extreme measures to isolate and control the spread of the disease. Nowhere else in the world would it be possible to have a lockdown of the city of the size of Wuhan, with its 11 million populations; or genome sequence the virus which they have now made public; or reach diagnostic tests; and mobilise 6,000 medical personnel for Wuhan. That is why the WHO has also praised the Chinese authorities in their handling of the epidemic and the measures they have taken.\nWhat is a coronavirus? Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect the respiratory tract. They include the familiar ones such as common cold and influenza, and also the more worrying ones that affect us from time to time, such as SARS, MERS, avian flu, swine flew, and now nCoV. They may cause mild body ache, sneezing, coughing, fever, and in severe cases complications such as pneumonia.\nThe earlier two similar viruses that have caused lung infections are SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and MERS, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Both these viruses originated from other species. SARS was a bat virus, and MERS was infections from camel to humans. Unlike MERS, both SARS and cCoV, while originating from other species, have the human to human transmission, making them much more infectious. The nCoV is infectious even when it is incubating in the body and no symptoms are visible. This means people who are completely unaware that they are carrying the infection, can also infect others. This makes controlling the spread difficult. With 7,711 confirmed cases, the Chinese authorities are also monitoring another 88,693 who have been in close contacts with the infected patients.\nThere have been various theories about the species from which the virus originated as well as the place where this specie jump occurred. Initially, as a cluster of cases had been reported from the sea food market in Wuhan, this was thought to be the place of origin. As this also where a lot of wild animals are sold, tt was theorised that this virus could be from a snake.\nAfter the genome sequence has been made public, it is now clear that there are cases that did not originate from the Wuhan market, and the virus may have spread, but it did not originate from the market. While the first recorded case of the virus is December 2019, the likely date of earliest ancestral version as constructed from the 28 virus sequence the Chinese authorities have made public indicate, is in early November. This would be the date when the first mutated virus infected a human being, from which all infections can be traced. The virus is also now being recognised as closest to various bat viruses, and a bat virus is the most likely source of nCoV.\nWhat kind of medicines do we have in our repertoire against the nCoV? How quickly can we identify or develop such medicines? Can we develop a vaccine against this virus?\nHere is where the great advances we have made in the last few decades come in. First is the speed with which the virus has been sequenced. This was the first step in developing a diagnostic kit and making it widely available. The Chinese authorities are now supplying a large number of such kits for a quick identification of those infected, and isolating them as quickly as possible. The second is testing existing medicines that we have against similar diseases, hoping some of them will work against nCoV as well.\nChinese researchers have found that out of 30 odd antiviral and other drugs, three existing drugs\u2014Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Ritonavir\u2014have fairly good inhibitory effects. This research was jointly conducted by the Academy of Military Medical Sciences and the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). Of course, moving from laboratory level to actual trials is still a big step, but the speed with which this has been done is unthinkable in a different era.\nIn addition, the Chinese medical authorities are also testing a number of traditional Chinese medicines for therapeutic effects, but no such candidate has yet emerged. This is not surprising, as traditional medicines would work against diseases that are stable, allowing traditional practitioners to gather sufficient empirical knowledge to treat such diseases. If the disease is novel, it would not have been seen by such practitioners, and therefore unlikely that a traditional medicine would be available against it.\nThe second line of defence, and in the long run the most important one, is a vaccine. Once the virus is isolated, a vaccine is of course a matter of time. Traditional vaccine development takes almost six months to develop, after which we can conduct clinical trials and decide on their effectiveness. This time, we have a much more powerful toolkit. As we know, traditional vaccines work as we use either a much milder form of the disease, or a small snippet of the virus DNA to trigger an immune response in the body. This works to protect us from future infections from the same virus. This time, we also have messenger RNA\u2014or mRNA\u2014that can induce a similar immune response of the body. These vaccines can be developed as fast as 30-40 days and can then be fast-tracked into clinical trials before they are mass produced and used to vaccinate the entire population.\nA Chinese and three international companies are in the race to produce an mRNA based vaccine. In this case, it should not be viewed as competition, as more such candidates, more the chance of success of a vaccine that would work against nCoV.\nA word on the other aspects of the infection, particularly on the West\u2019s pathological hatred of China and Russia. A whole bunch of fabrications are now being advanced, of Chinese developing a biological weapon in Wuhan\u2019s biological laboratories that simply got away. I would give them the same credence of stories that the US engineered the AIDS virus for weapon purposes, and it escaped while testing in Africa.\nThe second is the nonsense of homeopathy and traditional medicines having cures for nCoV. If a disease has not been seen, and a medicine has not been tested against it, to talk about a cure existing is foolish. None of the so-called medicines have been tested against nCoV, as it has yet to emerge in India. Ayush\u2019s claim, without any testing or logic that traditional medicines can work against such disease is based on not knowledge, but on belief. Similarly homeopathic claims, which always emerge in times of epidemics, particularly viral epidemics, have always failed when tested.\nWhat such claims do is to delay treatment, particularly for the old and others whose immune systems are weak. Most healthy people will recover from such virus infections; it is the older people who fall prey to serious illness, and also die from such viral diseases. Just so that we understand the scale of the flu virus infections, a part of the family of coronaviruses, an estimated one billion get infected by flu every year and the mortality rate is 300,000-700,000. The flu still remains our biggest killer in the coronavirus family, and every time a new outbreak of SARS, avian flu or now nCoV takes place, we are reminded of the influenza pandemic of 1918 that killed an estimated 50 million worldwide.\nClaiming false cures will only delay the essential measures that need to be taken; what WHO has said: isolate the suspected patient, provide immediate support, and follow-up on the contacts to prevent further spread. Not hocus pocus medicine.",

Epidemiologist Carmen Hernandez, who works for the opposition-led state government, was also detained. They were all accused of refusing to provide information on the victims\u2019 health status to the government.\n\u201cI hope this outbreak will come to an end soon, that we can contact all infected people, give them their respective treatment and guarantee their prompt recovery,\u201d Maduro said Wednesday after reporting eight new cases in the region.\nSeventy of Venezuela\u2019s 298 confirmed cases of the disease are directly connected to the academy, according to the government.\nOutbreak, Crackdown\nHernadez\u2019s lawyer, Argenis Rodriguez, said by phone that the accusation is false and that her client could face up to six years in prison despite never visiting the academy.\nThe family of a prospect recently signed by the the Philadelphia Phillies, are among those being monitored for the virus, Maduro said. Although Maduro didn\u2019t name him, the Phillies last month signed outfielder Yhoswar Garcia from the academy.\nMaduro didn\u2019t say that either the player or his family are sick. The Phillies didn\u2019t immediately reply to a written request for comment.\nIn 2018, academy players Edgar Navarro and Jesus Rondon signed as rookie pitchers for the White Sox\u2019s Dominican Summer League, while Ismael Gomez signed as a rookie pitcher for the Gulf Coast League of the New York Yankees.\nVenezuelans are well represented on U.S. major league teams, and it used to be common for them to play in their home country\u2019s league during the off-season. Last year, Major League Baseball barred players from participating in the Venezuelan Winter League, due to sanctions imposed by President Donald Trump.\nThis week, the military banned local residents from leaving their homes after 4 p.m., threatening those who don\u2019t comply with bio-terrorism charges.\nThe government is using the outbreak as a pretext to crack down on political opponents, said Alfredo Romero, director of the human rights NGO Penal Forum.

        "content": "While bats may be the original hosts of the novel Chinese coronavirus, an animal sold at a seafood market in Wuhan may be spreading the deadly virus to humans, a study published in The Lancet journal suggests.\nThe analysis of 10 gene sequences of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from nine patients in the central Chinese city of Wuhan found that the virus is most closely related to two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses.\nThe researchers, including those from the Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences in China, said that their analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of the virus.\nHowever, an animal sold at the Huanan seafood market might represent an intermediate host that enables the emergence of the virus in humans, they said.\nFor this reason, the researchers noted, future evolution, adaptation and spread of this virus require urgent investigation.\nCell and secretion samples were taken from the lungs of the patients who were diagnosed with viral pneumonia of unidentified cause.\nThe harvested samples of the 2019-nCoV virus were then analysed to determine the origin of the virus, and how it enters human cells.\nEight of the patients had visited the Huanan seafood market. One patient had never visited the market but had stayed in a hotel near the market before the onset of their illness.\nThe researchers found 2019-nCoV in all 10 genetic samples taken from the patients \u2013 including eight complete genomes, and two partial genomes.\nThe genetic sequences of the samples were nearly identical, which indicates a very recent emergence of the virus into humans, according to the researchers.\n\"It is striking that the sequences of 2019-nCoV described here from different patients were almost identical,\" said one of lead authors, Weifeng Shi, from Shandong First Medical University, and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences.\n\"This finding suggests that 2019-nCoV originated from one source within a very short period, and was detected relatively rapidly,\" Shi said.\nAs the virus transmits to more individuals, the researchers said, constant surveillance of mutations arising is needed.\nComparing the 2019-nCoV genetic sequence with a library of viruses, they found that the most closely related viruses were two SARS-like coronaviruses of bat origin, which shared 88 per cent of the genetic sequence.\n2019-nCoV was more genetically distant to the human SARS virus \u2013 which shared about 79 per cent of the genetic sequence \u2013 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus, which shared about 50 per cent of the genetic sequence.\nAnalysing how the virus binds, and then enters the human cells, the researchers found that 2019-nCoV and human SARS virus have similar structures, despite some small differences.\nThe researchers suggest that 2019-nCoV might use the same molecular doorway to enter the cells as SARS but noted that this will require confirmation.\nBased on the data, they said, it seems likely that the 2019-nCoV causing the Wuhan outbreak might also be initially hosted by bats, and transmitted to humans via a currently unknown wild animal sold at the Huanan seafood market.\nThey said that it is more likely that bat coronaviruses are mutating than 2019-nCoV \u2013 meaning that the virus is unlikely to have emerged due to a chance mutation.\n\"These data are consistent with a bat reservoir for coronaviruses in general and 2019-nCoV in particular,\" said Professor Guizhen Wu, from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\"However, despite the importance of bats, it seems likely that another animal host is acting as an intermediate host between bats and humans,\" said Wu.\nShe explained that the outbreak was first reported in late December 2019, when most bat species in Wuhan are hibernating.\nNo bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market, whereas many non-aquatic animals (including mammals) were, Wu noted.\nAlso, the similarities in the genetic sequences between 2019-nCoV and its close relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 were less than 90 per cent, meaning these two bat-derived coronaviruses are not direct ancestors of 2019-nCoV, she said.",

The rapid success of Innophore , as the spin-off is called, is based on a computer-based platform that was developed by the company itself.\nThe coronavirus epidemic that emerged from an outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the start of the new year is attributed to a previously unknown coronavirus that is transferable from certain types of vertebrates to humans. It causes severe pneumonia in those affected. There have already been quite a number of fatalities. Coronavirus 2019-nCoV\nOn January the 13th, 2020, the complete genome sequence of an isolate of the latest coronavirus was deposited in the NCBI Gene Bank, one of the three major DNA sequence databases. Almost simultaneously, the first detection method for the virus was announced. The term 2019-nCoV, which has since been adopted by the World Health Organisation, is regarded as provisional.\nThe announcement of the genome was the defining moment for Innophore . The spin-off has developed a search engine for the pharmaceutical industry as well as for industrial processes \u2013 the Catalaphore Platform . By utilizing Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, this platform can find enzymes and active ingredients both swiftly and in a cost-effective way. Usually this process requires complex and lengthy tests inside chemical laboratories. In the event of viral diseases, such as the coronavirus 2019-nCoV, time is of the essence. And this is the major advantage that the Catalaphore Platform offers. Bioinformatic processes (c) Andreas Schlesinger\nPhoto: The start-up company Innophore used bioinformatic processes to find the key enzymes and active substances for combating the 2019-nCoV coronavirus. The search for an antidote\nAs soon as the genome was made public, the Innophore team started looking on their own initiative for a key enzyme in this class of viruses \u2013 and they found it. This discovery formed the basis for further efforts to find active substances that were approved for other viruses and which may, theoretically at least, be suitable for combating the coronavirus 2019-nCoV. The catalaphore platform also led the way to successful results in this search.\nThis identification of already approved drugs for new pharmaceutical purposes is known in research circles as drug repurposing or drug repositioning. Consortium in the fight against coronavirus 2019-nCoV\nAfter publication of their findings, Innophore was contacted by a representative of a large pharmaceutical company based in Beijing. Since then, the spin-off has been working with a consortium on proposals for potential drugs against the coronavirus 2019-nCoV. Alongside this pharmaceutical concern, the consortium also includes the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Preventio n and a team of carefully selected bioinformaticians.\nIt remains to be seen over the coming weeks whether the active ingredient identified and proposed by Innophore will actually have the desired effect against the virus.\nInnophore was founded in 2017 by Christian Gruber, Georg Steinkeller and Karl Gruber as a spin-off from the University of Graz and the Austrian Centre of Industrial Biotechnology (acib). With EOSS Industries as a strategic investor, the company has built up an international customer base which includes renowned major players such as Merck and Henkel.",

This means they can spread between animals and humans. Out of these, gamma and delta corona viruses generally infect birds. Alpha and Beta viruses reside in mammals.\nViruses are capable of infecting all forms of life. It includes plants, other micro organisms including bacteria, single celled organisms called archaea.

Their International Officer, Yang Aibing correspond with IFSW saying: As soon as the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic was announced, CASW started a series of actions, for example, we released \u201cthe National Social Workers proposal\u201d to call on social workers for personal protection, and fulfilling the mission of the industry to support the prevention and control of the epidemic. CASW also published \u201cThe Social Worker Support Manual on the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia Caused by the Coronavirus Infection\u201d, which proposes the basic working principles and methods to social workers during the prevention and control period. Meanwhile, CASW has launched an online training course to \u201cFight Against the Epidemic based on the Community \u2014 Series of Social Work Courses\u201d, to provide professional guidance and psychological support for social workers to effectively participate in the prevention and control of the virus. Since the outbreak, CASW has been working closely with member organizations to launch online \u201cMental Health Assistance Campaign Against New Coronary Pneumonia\u201d to provide online psychological counselling to the public who are impacted. The CASW branches in provinces have also actively guided local social workers to participate in the prevention and control of the coronavirus epidemic and launching their own guidelines on the prevention and control of the epidemic. At present, the main ways for social workers to participate in epidemic prevention and control are online psychological counselling, offline community screening and education. Wuhan Association of Social Workers recruited social workers to provide volunteer services and medical staff to provide psychological counselling and relief services, community workers psychosocial support and backup support services such as home quarantine. Wuhan has also established the \u201c2 + 3\u201d online community anti-virus mode, which means 2 professional workers (1 social worker, 1 community worker) + 3 volunteers (medical worker, psychological worker, assistant), working with mobile internet tools to help local governments to implement \u201chome from home\u201d home screening and early intervention; Shanghai Social Workers Association launched the \u201cEpidemic Fighting \u2013 Shanghai Social Workers\u2019 Service Group\u201d, Guangzhou Social Workers Association launched \u201cGuangzhou Social Workers\u2019 Cotton Sponge Guard Hotline\u201d, they are providing community residents with advisory services on new pneumonia prevention knowledge and epidemic prevention and control policies; also providing online counselling and support services for confirmed or suspected patients, such as psychological assistance, emotional support and medical assistance; providing epidemic prevention assistance, life assistance and other support services to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in the community; collecting and sorting out real and feasible epidemic prevention and control knowledge and information; providing relevant information counselling services for community residents, and online services such as information counselling, knowledge promotion, psychological counselling and emotional counselling for residents in psychological panic and pressure. Chengdu social workers are going door to door in the community to check the epidemic, coordinating medical supplies, etc. We list here the activities of only a few major provinces. In fact, social workers in every province are actively involved, because this is one thing that concerns all of us. We believe that everyone\u2019s efforts are the greatest support for prevention and to contain the spread of the epidemic. We hope we can overcome this difficulty as soon as we could. IFSW Asia-Pacific Regional President Rose Henderson commented, \u201cI congratulate the CASW taking such a positive and constructive leadership in responding to this crisis. Further, I am sure that the guiding documents, training and response work CASW have developed would be very valuable to share with social work colleagues regionally and globally as the virus spreads across borders. I encourage CASW and other colleagues across our region also now involved in responding to this virus to continue to share your wisdom and resources as we collectively work with the increasing prevalence of this illness. I commend the work of social workers in China and acknowledge the huge challenges of being both impacted personally at the same time as you are responding to the needs of your communities.\u201d\nRory Truell, IFSW Secretary-General added, \u201cThe profession of social work has been an essential pillar in the prevention of the spread of diseases. Records dating back from the Victorian slums in England and the USA, through to current examples, show that the profession has successfully worked with virus control throughout the world. The fight against HIV/AIDS, SARS and Ebola have all needed more than a medical response and the social work role in providing community education, support, information and reducing panic have been key factors in the control or elimination of diseases resulting in saving millions of lives. The lessons being learnt in China today highlight the need for every government to build and strengthen social work services. Communities supported with knowledge and information on how to act is essential for our futures.\u201d\nCASW has asked for international support by sending Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), particularly masks, sanitizers and handwashing gels.",

        "content": "Clover Biopharmaceuticals, a global clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel and transformative biologic therapies, announced today that it has successfully produced its trimeric Spike-protein (\u201cS-Trimer\u201d) subunit vaccine candidate for 2019-nCoV via a mammalian cell expression system. In addition, Clover scientists have used the newly obtained S-Trimer and successfully detected antigen-specific antibody in sera from multiple fully recovered patients who were previously infected by the virus. Importantly, Clover is the first company in the world to disclose a 2019-nCoV vaccine candidate that can successfully be recognized by antibodies produced by previously-infected patients, supporting that S-Trimer has preserved the native structure of the viral spike (S) protein and thus may elicit a protective-immune response as a vaccine. This work was carried out with the support of leadership teams from Chengdu Hi-Tech Park and Chengdu Clinical Center for Public Health in China.\nSimilar to other enveloped RNA viruses such as HIV, RSV and Influenza, 2019-nCoV is also an RNA virus that has a trimeric spike (S) protein on its viral envelope. The trimeric S protein of 2019-nCoV is responsible for binding to host cell surface receptor ACE2 and subsequent viral entry. Symptoms in infected patients include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties, and it can be fatal.\nUpon knowing the genomic DNA sequence of this newly identified 2019-nCoV last month, Clover scientists immediately started designing the viral S-protein construct and completed its gene synthesis. Utilizing our patented Trimer-Tag \u00a9 technology, Clover has produced a S-Trimer subunit vaccine that resembles the native trimeric viral spike via a rapid mammalian cell-culture based expression system. Having one of the largest in-house, commercial-scale cGMP biomanufacturing capabilities in China, Clover could potentially be able to rapidly scale-up and produce large-quantities of a new coronavirus vaccine.\nClover has previously developed recombinant subunit-Trimer vaccines for RSV and Influenza viruses utilizing its Trimer-Tag \u00a9 technology and has demonstrated that they are able to evoke protective neutralizing antibody responses in multiple animal models.\n\u201cI am very excited that Clover has achieved high-level expression of the native-like trimeric viral Spike protein (S-Trimer) in mammalian cells in record time, and importantly, we have used the newly-obtained vaccine candidate to successfully detect viral S protein-specific antibodies from the sera of multiple patients who recently recovered from 2019-nCoV infection in China. The implication of this discovery is that it not only has validated the correct conformation of our S-Trimer subunit vaccine candidate, but also further supports that the new 2019-nCov virus is indeed the culprit for the current epidemic, since all previous diagnosis for the viral infections have been based on nucleic acid detection. This important finding forms a solid foundation for the continued rapid development of S-Trimer vaccine through pilot production, preclinical efficacy and safety studies, followed by human clinical trials and subsequent large-scale production.\u201d said Dr. Peng Liang, co-founder, Chairman and President of Clover. \u201cWe remain confident that Clover can be among one of the first companies to develop a successful vaccine to contain the 2019-nCoV epidemic, as well as any future outbreaks of similar coronaviruses\u201d.\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the rapid progress of our S-Trimer vaccine development for 2019-nCoV and hope to support global efforts in fighting this epidemic,\u201d said Joshua Liang, Chief Strategy Officer and Board Director at Clover. \u201cTo this end, we recognize that collaborations will be critical to accelerating the development of a successful new vaccine in times of emergency, and we invite any interested regulatory, academic or industry parties to contact us for this noble common cause.\u201d\nAbout Clover Biopharmaceuticals\nClover Biopharmaceuticals is a global, clinical-stage, research-based biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing transformative biologic therapies, with a focus on oncology and autoimmune diseases, as well as viral vaccines. Having raised more than US$ 100 million in total capital since 2016, Clover is utilizing its proprietary Trimer-Tag \u00a9 technology platform to develop novel biologics targeting trimerization-dependent pathways. Additionally, Clover is leveraging its in-house cGMP biomanufacturing capabilities to develop select biosimilars. For more information, please visit our website: www.cloverbiopharma.com . www.cloverbiopharma.com .\nAbout Trimer-Tag \u00a9 Technology\nTrimer-Tag \u00a9 is an innovative drug development platform which allows the production of novel, covalently-trimerized fusion proteins. Many major disease targets are trimerization-dependent such as the tumor necrosis factor superfamily (involved in extrinsic apoptosis, immune co-stimulation and inflammation) as well as enveloped RNA virus antigens responsible for entry into host cells. Clover is using Trimer-Tag technology to create trimerized fusion proteins that are able to effectively target these previously undruggable pathways.\nAbout Wuhan Coronavirus 2019-nCoV\nThe new coronavirus identified in late 2019 has been officially named by WHO as 2019-nCoV on January 12, 2020. Coronavirus is a family of enveloped RNA viruses that include MERS and SARS, both of which caused serious human infections of respiratory system. 2019-nCov has never before been found in human, and since this outbreak was first reported in late-2019, the virus has so far infected over 40,000 people and has caused over 900 reported deaths (as of February 9, 2020). It has been declared a Public Health Emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). Currently there is no vaccine available for the virus.",

It\u2019s called the Close Contact app. This app sends people alerts about the Coraona virus due to close contact. So that people can be protected against the virus. In China today, because of the corona virus, the situation is very serious, yet thousands of people have fallen victim to this virus.\nThe National Health Commission of China and China Electronics Group Corporations have created the app. The National Health Commission of China reported that this app also enables people to scan QR codes for mobile apps such as Alipay, WeChat and QQ. Users can find out with their name and ID number whether they have come into contact with an infected person at a common location, such as office, classroom, train or flight.\nAfter China, the threat of corona virus spread throughout the world is also having an impact on the technology industry. Due to this virus MWC 2020, the largest technology event in the world to be held in Barcelona, has also had to be cancelled. The MWC (Mobile World Congress) event was scheduled to take place from 24 February to 27 February. In fact, due to the threat of coronavirus, several large companies refused to attend this event, after which the GSM Association decided to cancel this year\u2019s event.\nIndustry experts believe that supplies from China may come to a complete halt in the coming times. Supply of the components of the smartphone, i.e. the parts of the phone, is slow at present, which can be stopped for some time in the coming time. As a result, the price of the phone components can increase, which will directly affect the price of the phone. The price of smartphones in India may therefore also increase.\nThe post Chinese Government has introduced a close contact app, which will help avoid Corona appeared first on Mobile Computing Today .",

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200423005604/en/\nAs widely reported, widespread testing of millions of people is currently hampered by a shortage of testing supplies. Each Origin One 3D printer has the ability to produce batches of 1,500 Origin NP O1 Swabs at a time, multiple times daily. Origin is moving towards a streamlined process allowing the production of approximately 190,000 per day, or 1.3 million per week.\nStratasys will leverage its position as a leading provider of 3D printing solutions to the healthcare industry to market Origin NP O1 Swabs. Stratasys has already been actively serving healthcare systems across the country during the pandemic by leading a coalition that has been providing 3D-printed face shields to nearly 100 front-line organizations. To date, the coalition has provided about 40,000 shields at no cost to health systems.\nStratasys Americas President Rich Garrity said Stratasys is ready to help get millions of swabs to wherever they are most needed. \"We have tremendous confidence in Origin's 3D printing technology, and we're confident in our ability to help bring them to market efficiently,\" he said.\nOrigin CEO, Christopher Prucha said Origin is ready to scale quickly. \"We believe widespread testing can help save lives and get our economy going again, and we're confident that our Origin One technology and simple material requirements will be able to produce millions of swabs to meet the need,\" he said. \"We've been impressed by the speed with which Stratasys has been able to provide thousands of shields to healthcare systems across the country and believe they are the right partner for helping get millions of swabs where they are most needed.\"\nOrigin swabs were tested in a clinical trial with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, an academic medical center affiliated with Harvard Medical School. Origin reports that results show Origin swabs performed the highest with regard to concordance to control swabs compared to two other 3D printed swabs. In addition, in subjective feedback, Origin swabs were preferred over the other 3D printed swabs.\nEach Origin NP O1 Swab is autoclavable and individually packaged. More information is available at www.stratasys.com/covid-19 , along with other information about how Stratasys is responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nStratasys (Nasdaq: SSYS) is a global leader in additive manufacturing or 3D printing technology and is the manufacturer of FDM \u00ae , PolyJet\u2122, and stereolithography 3D printers.

        "content": "Ever since I participated in debate competitions in high school and maybe before, I have relished the occasional thrill of winning an argument against a smart opponent. Forgive me for bragging, but I can rightfully boast some pretty impressive victories, especially my many victories against the smartest opponent of all: God. That sounds pretty amazing, I know, but I've discovered that it's relatively easy to win arguments against Him. In fact, I won several in a row in the past few weeks.\nThe key to winning the argument is first listening so you can know what to argue against. Prayer is a great way to get started. Pray and seek for guidance in some aspect of your life. Humbly sense that guidance. Feel free to write it down. And then, think carefully of all the reasons why it is ridiculous and doesn't apply to you. Strong logical skills are a plus here if you want a decisive victory. Provide your reasons, dismiss His suggestion, and voila, you are likely to win because I've found that He often doesn't do much of a rebuttal.\nGod, in fact, is a terrible debater. No offense, but it's true. In debate, after one side critiques your proposal, it's important to carefully respond to and rebut each argument they have raised. God, I'm sad to say, is rather week in this regard. Although He's the Ultimate in intelligence, His mastery of debate techniques seems to pale in comparison with the skills most of us mortals have.\nFor example, two months ago, in praying for guidance on the things I needed to do, I had a distinct impression: go to the Shanghai office of Woori Bank (a Korean bank that was said to be a relatively safe place to park some money in a world where many banks are now close to insolvency) and take out the money I had there in an unusual US dollar account. It wasn't much, but wasn't trivial. I actually wrote that down on my to-do list for that week. I would write it down again for two or three more weeks after that. I came close to going right before our recent trip to Vietnam, but fortunately was able to come up with some very logical reasons about why there was no need to do that. I would be 6 months before I left China and had plenty of time, and the time I took to do that in January would be time I couldn't do some important things for my work, my callings, whatever. It just made no sense, and I provided persuasive reasons why I could delay that prompting. No rebuttal. God walked away. Bingo, I won! Such an easy victory. (I say that with all due respect.)\nI had similar victories as I was packing and preparing for our short trip to Vietnam almost a month ago. I was repeatedly prompted to bring my journal, to bring a backup hard disk, to bring extra cash, to bring a an unnecessarily large supply of medication, and most strangely of all, to bring some of my collection of magic tricks that I use daily when I am around my grandchildren. My arguments were to the point and overwhelmingly persuasive: \"There's no way I'm going to be doing magic tricks for Vietnamese kids. There's no need for extra cash in Vietnam and it could be stolen. I need to travel light, so my heavy journal will be a burden that I can deal with after my short trip. And bringing my backup disk puts me at risk of having it and my computer stolen while traveling -- a disaster.\" God just didn't have any reply to such persuasiveness. Victory, victory, victory! So sweet.\nOn the other hand , now that the Corona virus has swept across China and made it impossible or unwise to return home to Shanghai after my short trip to Vietnam, causing my wife and I to flee to the US as \"medical refugees,\" where we are now hanging out with family, I can somewhat admit that some of those illogical suggestions might have been slightly useful after all. Since I may not be able to return to China before my visa expires, I may not ever see that money at Woori Bank. I called them yesterday and they explained that for my protection, the only way they will ever let me access the US dollars in my account is to show up at their office in Shanghai with my passport (and visa, of course). The good news, though, is that if I die and my wife can provide proper documentation and evidence of death, she may have a chance of getting some of it if she also goes to China. The helpful employee I reached was chuckling over my situation and the impact of China's and the bank's regulations. Hilarious, I know! My other bank accounts have ATM cards that allow me to withdraw money here in the US, but not that special US dollar account with the appropriately named Woori Bank.\nThe journal, with some precious accounts, would have been nice. The medication would have been useful but I found some more in Vietnam. The hard disk would have been helpful, but I bought another. The magic tricks, well, surprisingly, they would really come in handy now that I am staying much of the time with a family of six grandchildren who are magic addicts and visiting another grandchild in Minnesota tonight who also loves magic. So, grudgingly, I can sort of see some point to some of my Opponent's suggestions, but that doesn't change the fact that I absolutely won the argument -- and lost some valuable resources and time, while gaining some unnecessary worries.\nI guess winning arguments is not always the best policy when dealing with God. Yes, I'll acknowledge His awesome intelligence, but wish He were a more vigorous debater so it wouldn't always be so easy for me to win.\nMercifully, we may have found a way to retrieve the journal and some other much-needed items. I'll report on that story in a few days, which abounds in examples of the great kindness of some foreign and local friends in China who made that possible as an answer to prayer (it was also a rare example of me finally not arguing when there was a good argument to be made against an implausible suggestion). God may not be the best debater by human standards, but He often helps us find second chances or new paths forward after we make major blunders in our lives (sometimes as a result of a very persuasive win in our debates with God). Keep seeking Him and listening to His guidance, in whatever situation you are in. He may have some interesting things for your to-do list, whether it's something small that might help you to bless your neighbor, relieve someone in distress, solve major problems in your life, or prepare to flee your home on your own journey to somewhere unexpected.",

KBRA believes that aircraft values and lease rate declines will be contingent on two factors, namely, the speed of economic recovery and the path that surviving airlines take in deciding the composition of their fleets post-coronavirus.\nRoughly half of the total global passenger fleet was parked as a result of severe travel restrictions. Further, we expect that many aircraft may be removed from service through early retirement and/or be returned to lessors at lease end, in anticipation of significant passenger traffic reduction. Aircraft lessors will be tested as more aircraft would need to be remarketed as a result of lease expiry and airline bankruptcies, resulting in more downward pressure on lease rates.\nAs the coronavirus\u2019 impact continues the shape of economic recovery is becoming increasing more difficult to predict, but KBRA believes the younger, fuel-efficient aircraft are best positioned to be key for airlines and lessors post-pandemic.",

Human Rights Commission Race Relations Commissioner Meng Foon slammed the ad as \"absolutely bad taste\".\n\"It's deplorable that this business is capitalising on people dying.\"\nWhen he saw the picture Foon said he felt \"sick to the core\".\nUsing this situation to gain financial gain was just not on, he said.\nWhen the Whakaari/White Island eruption, and the Christchurch terror attack, happened there were no such promotions, he said.\n\"People are sick in the mind.\"\nLawrenson Group chief executive officer John Lawrenson, who owns House on Hood, told Stuff he thought the original ad was fine and had expected this kind of reaction.\n\"About 90 per cent of people react with a like or a laugh and about 10 per cent with an angry or sad face.\n\"However, the 10 per cent are very vocal and share and comment to express their displeasure and that seems to drastically increase the reach of the ad for us.\"\nHowever, hours later the ad was taken down, and replaced with a toned down version, after Lion said said they did not condone it.\n\"We have been in touch with the venue and asked that it be discontinued,\" a spokesperson said.\nLawrenson said Lion had no clout to stop him doing the post, as he did not actually buy his Corona from them. But someone had called him and asked him nicely for a favour, so he said yes.\nHe had reworked the post and uploaded a picture of a Corona bottle wearing a protective mask. \"Let's be honest, there are worse things you can catch in Hamilton. Coronas still $6.50 all summer long\", it says.\nKing St advertising chief executive officer Chris Williams said he had been waiting for someone to do something like this.\nWhile he said shock advertising could do well in the short-term, he didn't think it was right to cash in on this situation.\n\"It's in bad taste and just not right. People are dying.\"\nWilliams said he didn't think the term \"any publicity was good publicity\" applied anymore and said this ad was no different to Otago cartoonist Garrick Tremain's cartoon mocking the deadly Samoan measles epidemic .\n\"That was terrible as well. This is no different in many ways.\"\nHamilton Mayor Paula Southgate also thought the ad was really insensitive.\n\"People have lost their lives and people are fearful of it,\" she said.\n\"I'm not a fan of what I would describe as poor taste.\"\nThe original post received mixed responses on Facebook, with some people calling it \"shameful\" and other \"brilliant\".\nCHRIS SKELTON/STUFF Race Relations Commissioner Meng Foon felt \"sick to the core\" when he saw the ad.\nThis isn't the first time House on Hood has used current affairs as an advertising opportunity.\nThey played on a crude joke Hamilton City Councillor Mark Bunting sent to freelance journalist Angela Cuming in 2017, but later deleted the post at the request of council.\nWhen Metiria Turei was in trouble with Winz they posted a meme as well as when Bill English lost the Eminem case for copyright and NZ First and Labour formed a coalition.\nLawrenson said they had covered a range of topical personalities in the past, from Bill English, Simon Bridges and Israel Folau to Brian Tamaki, Greta Thunberg and Metiria Turei.\n\"It's unavoidable that some will disagree with the approach, but many others love it, and it has certainly been successful.\"\nLawrenson said the success of these ads was based on the fact in society there was a small per cent of the population that took it upon themselves to be outraged on behalf of everyone else.\n\"I guess I would say to them that just because they are offended, it doesn't mean that everyone else is. There are probably far more impactful things they could be doing with their time than frantically typing on their keyboards.\"",

South Korea. Japan. Thailand. Sudan. Kenya. Ivory Coast. Ethiopia. Colombia. Indonesia.\nAnd the list will grow because it now appears the virus (2019-nCoV) is as easily contracted as is its cousin, the common head cold. And that is one reason is has spread so quickly internationally.\nEven though the virus appears to have mutated to a person-to-person virus in a market in a large central Chinese city, it has quickly jumped the quarantined city boundaries because people exposed to the virus have spread the virus in their travels. Mainly by airplane. And now by cruise ship.\nI have a rather selfish motive in following these stories. I am scheduled to join a south Asia cruise in less than two months. With the exception of one country (Oman) every country we will visit has had 2019-nCoV exposure -- including Hong Kong, my favorite airport where I will spend several hours on a layover. Short of an international quarantine shutdown of all airlines, I will make the trip.\nNot traveling because of a fear of 2019-nCoV would be absurdly silly -- the virus will eventually make its way to Mexico.\nLast night I had dinner with David and Laura Holmquist at Lora Loka's in La Manzanilla.

It was one of those nights that slipped by in peals of chuckles.\nIt was not until this morning that I realized I had spent my first encounter with a Mexican epidemic at Lora Loka's. Eleven years ago.\nThe year was 2009. April. I had just moved to Mexico when the 2009 swine flu (H1N1) epidemic hit Mexico. It started in The States. But with the high traffic between The States and Mexico, it quickly spread south. And, eventually, to the rest of the world.\nThe two governments handled the situation quite differently. President Obama suggested that Americans use the same common sense they would apply to any flu (wash your hands; if you have flu symptoms, see a doctor and get rest at home). He and Vice-President Biden then went out for a public dinner of hamburgers to build public confidence.\nWhen the death toll in Mexico (primarily in Mexico City) hit 100, the Mexican government took an opposite tack. It ordered the cancellation of all public gatherings. Restaurants. Movies. F\u00fatbol matches. Concerts. Those white masks that make everyone look like a Japaneses bank robber showed up everywhere. It could have a scene right out of the Black Death. Mexico's tourist trade collapsed.\nThe health authorities later confessed that they knew they had overly-dramatized the dangers of H1N1, but they suspected that because Mexicans have a long and well-deserved distrust of anything their government says, the health authorities had to resort to those methods.\nThe week I arrived in Villa Obreg\u00f3n , a fellow blogger (American Mommy in Mexico) informed me she and her family were visiting La Manzanilla, a beach town just north of us. She wanted to know if my brother and I would like to have dinner with her family and another blogger (Jan) and her son, Lyle.\nI always enjoy meeting the writers behind the essays we publish. I had met several other bloggers on the drive down. I said yes.\nWe then faced the problem that all of the restaurants in La Manzanilla were closed by the health edict. But, this is Mexico. There is always a way to do something you want to do.\nI do not remember who did the persuading, but Lora agreed to moved two of her tables far out on the sand where we put together our little publication party. And Lora served us her incomparable baked enchiladas. It is a night fondly-remembered ( supercalifragilisticexpialidocious ).\nMy dinner with David and Laura last night is going to be stored in that same file folder. The experience was quite different. But, if it had been the same, it would not have been special. Even the sunset was different. More Winslow Homer than J.M.W. Turner.\nWhen 2019-nCoV inevitably arrives in Mexico, I wonder if we will need to rely upon the creative services of Lora again?\n",

        "content": "Cases of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus have increased dramatically over the past week, prompting concerns about how contagious the virus is and how it spreads. According to the WHO, 16-21% of people with the virus in China became severely ill and 2-3% of those infected have died. A key factor that influences transmission is whether the virus can spread in the absence of symptoms \u2014 either during the incubation period (the days before people become visibly ill) or in people who never get sick. On January 26, 2020, Chinese officials said transmission had occurred during the incubation period. So what does the evidence tell us so far? TEM image of 2019-nCoV particles.\nCan you transmit it before you get symptoms?\nInfluenza is the classic example of a virus that can spread when people have no symptoms at all.\nIn contrast, people with SARS only spread the virus when they had symptoms.\nNo published scientific data are available to support China\u2019s claim transmission of 2019-nCoV occurred during the incubation period.\nHowever, one study published in The Lancet showed children may be shedding (or transmitting) the virus while asymptomatic.\nThe researchers found one child in an infected family had no symptoms but a chest CT scan revealed he had pneumonia and his test for the virus came back positive.\nThis is different to transmission in the incubation period, as the child never got ill, but it suggests it\u2019s possible for children and young people to be infectious without having any symptoms.\nThis is a concern because if someone gets sick, you want to be able to identify them and track their contacts. If someone transmits the virus but never gets sick, they may not be on the radar at all.\nIt also makes airport screening less useful because people who are infectious but don\u2019t have symptoms would not be detected.\nHow infectious is it?\nThe 2019-nCoV coronavirus epidemic began when people exposed to an unknown source at a seafood market in Wuhan began falling ill in early December 2019.\nCases remained below 50 to 60 in total until around January 20, 2020, when numbers surged. There have now been more than 4,500 cases \u2014 mostly in China \u2014 and 106 deaths.\nResearchers and public health officials determine how contagious a virus is by calculating a reproduction number, or R0. The R0 is the average number of other people that one infected person will infect, in a completely non-immune population.\nDifferent experts have estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV is anywhere from 1.4 to over five, however the WHO believes the RO is between 1.4 and 2.5.\nHere\u2019s how a virus with a R0 of two spreads: Here\u2019s how a virus with a R0 of two spreads. Image credit: The Conversation / CC BY-ND.\nIf the R0 was higher than 2-3, we should have seen more cases globally by mid January 2020, given Wuhan is a travel and trade hub of 11 million people.\nHow is it transmitted?\nOf the person-to-person modes of transmission, we fear respiratory transmission the most, because infections spread most rapidly this way.\nTwo kinds of respiratory transmission are through large droplets, which is thought to be short-range, and airborne transmission on much smaller particles over longer distances. Airborne transmission is the most difficult to control.\nSARS was considered to be transmitted by contact and over short distances by droplets but can also be transmitted through smaller aerosols over long distances. In Hong Kong, infection was transmitted from one floor of a building to the next.\nInitially, most cases of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus were assumed to be from an animal source, localized to the seafood market in Wuhan.\nWe now know it can spread from person to person in some cases. The Chinese government announced it can be spread by touching and contact. We don\u2019t know how much transmission is person to person, but we have some clues.\nCoronaviruses are respiratory viruses, so they can be found in the nose, throat and lungs.\nThe amount of 2019-nCoV appears to be higher in the lungs than in the nose or throat. If the virus in the lungs is expelled, it could possibly be spread via fine, airborne particles, which are inhaled into the lungs of the recipient.\nHow did the 2019-nCoV coronavirus spread so rapidly?\nThe continuing surge of cases in China since January 18, 2020 \u2014 despite the lockdowns, extended holidays, travel bans and banning of the wildlife trade \u2014 could be explained by several factors, or a combination of:\n(i) increased travel for New Year, resulting in the spread of cases around China and globally; travel is a major factor in the spread of infections;\n(ii) asymptomatic transmissions through children and young people; such transmissions would not be detected by contact tracing because health authorities can only identify contacts of people who are visibly ill;\n(iii) increased detection, testing and reporting of cases; there has been increased capacity for this by doctors and nurses coming in from all over China to help with the response in Wuhan;\n(iv) substantial person-to-person transmission;\n(v) continued environmental or animal exposure to a source of infection.\nHowever, with an incubation period as short as one to two days, if the 2019-nCoV coronavirus was highly contagious, we would expect to already have seen widespread transmission or outbreaks in other countries.\nRather, the increase in transmission is likely due to a combination of the factors above, to different degrees.\nThe situation is changing daily, and we need to analyze the transmission data as it becomes available.\nAuthor: C Raina MacIntyre , Professor of Global Biosecurity, NHMRC Principal Research Fellow, Head, Biosecurity Program, Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales.

These are usually focused on the first line of defence at national borders.\nBusinesses and organisations have a role to play in the pandemic response, especially when it comes to communicating and implementing good practice advice around hygiene protocols, use of personal protective equipment and behavioural changes (e.g. not shaking hands in meetings).\nWithin organizations, the management (in larger organisations supported by an assigned Business Continuity Manager), can use a range of proactive strategies.\nElaine Tomlin of Avalution Consulting (and chair of the BCI Forum in Ireland) stresses the importance of a clear, communications strategy across the organisation so that all relevant stakeholders (not just employees) are aware of pandemic policies and action plans. \u201cEnsure that one person is monitoring the pandemic and gathering information from an authoritative source. The WHO website at a global level and the national health service websites more locally.\u201d\nThe BCI recommended actions requiring attention include: Ensure management and team leaders are clear about the organisation\u2019s priority activities, people, skills and minimum staffing arrangements (information which should be available in a Business Continuity Plan).\nPrepare for expected employee absences e.g. knowing which employees are trained and can provide back-up for others who become ill (especially those with prioritised roles). Modify policies to give greater flexibility to normal working arrangements, such as:\u2013 provide (or expand) opportunities to work from home (taking into account network connectivity, security and bandwidth/performance requirements), make sure there are enough laptops available\u2013 greater use of telephone or video conferences rather than face-to-face meetings\n\u2013 reduce the number of people in the workplace at any one time through flexible working hours or rosters\u2013 provision for employees with children or unwell adults at home, or for employees who are reluctant to use public transport to get to work\u2013 reduce activities involving large groups of people (e.g. all-staff meetings, employee birthdays or other social events). Such policies should consider administrative, legislative (Occupational Health & Safety) and workplace relations requirements and procedures as well as psychological safety and morale.\n\u2013 Establish welfare policies for employees who seem to display relevant symptoms, have been caring for someone with the virus, or who have returned from travel in or through a known infection zone. Such policies might include:\n> protocols for those whose health is \u2018in-question\u2019 who want to come to work.> monitor who sits next to a person who has not turned up for work that day.\n> return to work protocols for those who have had the virus and have recovered.> presenteeism \u2013 how to deal with employees who should be at home but insist on coming to work> protocols for visitors and suppliers (e.g. the contractor who refills the water cooler, or cleaners who are present out of hours).> the means of monitoring / enforcing these practices within the workplace.\nReinforce internal peer support or other welfare mechanisms (counselling) to assist employees with health concerns.\nEnsure the workplace has adequate supplies of cleaning and hygiene products in accessible and visible locations (keeping the workplace hygienic is a collective responsibility).\nConfirm employees, customers and suppliers are aware of the organisation\u2019s pandemic continuity strategy, and alternate working arrangements, and they understand how they may be affected and involved.\nAvoid the use of social media as a source of trustworthy information (unless from official or trusted parties) and reinforce this advice with employees.\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control gives updates daily on the Geographical distribution of novel coronavirus cases globally ",

Said Dr. Chris Walzer, executive director of the Wildlife Conservation Society Global Health Program: \u201cPreventing future zoonotic outbreaks is not about targeting one species \u2013 like pangolins, bats and snakes \u2013 but taking strong actions to ban wet markets trading in wildlife and broadly strengthening wildlife laws and regulations. We applaud The National People\u2019s Congress of the People\u2019s Republic of China for declaring on Monday that it is revising wildlife protection laws, in order to strengthen the fight to end indiscriminate hunting and consumption of wild animals. \u201cChina is showing great leadership and we encourage other governments to follow suit. China is leading social changes for wildlife consumption and clearly showing that we can\u2019t solve the world\u2019s zoonotic disease challenge by targeting specific species but only by broadly strengthening wildlife laws and regulations. \u201cThe Chinese government has made it clear -- as the Chinese people have been making clear -- the abuse of wild animal consumption as food and illegal trade in wildlife are serious threats to public health and safety issues. \u201cWildlife laws in China were improved in 2016 but the government now has declared they see continuing problems that need improvement, including standards, technical procedures, supervision and inspection, law enforcement and the protection of endangered wildlife. \u201cWe applaud this leadership and continue to call for the permanent ban on the wet markets that trade in wildlife. All evidence continues to lead to the wildlife section of the market in Wuhan where the virus was transferred from animals in humans. Markets with mixed species from the wild are an ideal incubator and must be closed in China and elsewhere. \u201c We encourage international conservation and public health communities to continue to provide support to China for this effort. \u201d Background Video and Q&A on Why Live Animal Markets Trading in Wildlife Need to be Permanently Banned : HERE .

The national securities regulatory commission closed stock and futures markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen for two weeks to prevent viral transmission. And Beijing ordered movie theatres, internet cafes and other venues to shut down temporarily while hotels, conference centres, restaurants and galleries saw visitors almost disappear completely.\nChina\u2019s response to the current crisis appears to be swifter, and the disease less virulent, but the country now boasts a far more extensive high-speed rail network than it did in 2003, and its economy is six times larger, upping the risk of transmission and the repercussions of an epidemic.\n\u201cChina is the engine of the global economy, churning out goods,\u201d said German health economist Fred Roeder.\nIts critical role in international shipping may be thrown into disarray as authorities begin to hold back some ships from entering the port at Wuhan, a key hub on the Yangtze River.\n\u201cIf they cannot leave it creates huge delays in the supply chain and value chain of businesses all across the world,\u201d Roeder said. \u201cIt could actually hit the latest generation of smartphone if ports are shutting down.\u201d\nManufacturing could also feel the crunch as supply chains stall, he said.\nRoeder has felt firsthand the disruptive power of a pandemic. In the summer of 2003 the teenage Berliner was eagerly gearing up for a United Nations youth conference that would take him to Taipei, but the event was cancelled a few days beforehand due to SARS.\nThe epidemic also sparked layoffs and time away from work. At one point Singapore Airlines asked its 6,600 cabin crew to take unpaid leave. Children stayed home from school, prompting more parents to shirk their job duties and further reducing productivity, said AltaCorp Capital analyst Chris Murray.\n\u201cI was losing guys left, right and centre as people were quarantined,\u201d recalled Murray, based in Toronto \u2013 the epicentre of the SARS pandemic outside of Asia. The disease infected 438 Canadians in total and caused 44 deaths in the Toronto area.\nThe economic damage culminated with World Health Organization\u2019s one-week travel advisory for the city in April 2003, costing the Canadian economy an estimated $5.25 billion that year.\nThe outbreak of H1N1, or swine flu, in 2009 also sparked work \u201cdislocations,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIt went from, `Maybe it\u2019ll be okay,\u2019 to sheer panic.\u201d\nFreelancers and gig economy workers such as musicians or ride-hail drivers may feel the pinch more acutely, since they can\u2019t rely on a steady wage when demand shrinks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that unfortunately has happened before in a similar way and it tends to affect areas like retail,\u201d said Carolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, said this week.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t go out, they don\u2019t fly in planes, they don\u2019t do as much tourism to the affected areas,\u201d she said.\nThe fallout makes workers ranging from servers to wholesale bakers to non-unionized hotel staff more vulnerable. Meanwhile spending or investment plans by larger companies may have to be delayed, said Roeder.\nIt is not clear how lethal the new coronavirus is or even whether it is as dangerous as the ordinary flu, which kills about 3,500 people every year in Canada alone.\n\u201cStill, we should be extremely worried about the economic effects of this,\u201d Roeder said, calling on Chinese authorities to work transparently with Western governments and disease control experts to mitigate the crisis.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it hits the entire economy. No one benefits from this.\u201d ",

There are facts about the virus, according to the World Health Organization, as the virus is able to maintain its life and spread for up to 6 days. It is also easy to pass the virus on to others, just by breathing, using patient\u2019s tools, or touching contaminated surfaces. 12 days incubation Front-line doctors at the epidemic from Jinentan Hospital in Wuhan said that the incubation period of the Corona Virus is 12 days, which means that the virus will pass from the infected person to others without the patient\u2019s knowledge. According to BBC. The initial symptoms are similar to the common flu, such as sneezing, coughing, sinus obstruction, and high fever. However, it is not possible for the patient to distinguish between corona and regular influenza, through the apparent symptoms only, but it requires microscopic blood tests and serological tests. The first victim According to the doctors at the Jintin Hospital in Wuhan, the first patients dying of the disease appeared to be in good health. But the two have been smokers for many years, which may mean that the lungs of both of them were really tired. The first casualty was a 61-year-old man, who was suffering from severe pneumonia upon arrival at the hospital. The man was suffering from severe shortness of breath, which means that his lungs were unable to deliver enough oxygen to his body to survive. Despite being placed on a ventilator, his lungs and heart stopped working. The man or the woman? Recent figures indicate that there is more gender parity in the infection. The Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that the infection rate is 1.2 men per 1.0 women. Men may be more likely to contract the disease in a severe manner, which requires their transfer to hospital. Doctor Li Chang of the Jintan Hospital said that \u201clow female exposure to viral infection can be attributed to protection from the X chromosome and sex hormones that play an important role in immunity.\u201d",

This is especially true for those located in Wuhan City, the epicenter of the disease, as the Chinese government has put the city of 11 million people on lockdown in an effort to quarantine the virus.\nAs a result of the lockdown and the virus\u2019 spread across the country, some companies and factories have begun shifting production outside of China. One of Honda\u2019s suppliers, Ftech, is one of those companies. According to Nikkei Asian Review, The Japanese brake pedal maker is expected to move production from factory in Wuhan, China to its factory in the Philippines\nCurrently, Ftech\u2019s operations at its Wuhan plant is suspended due to the coronavirus outbreak and subsequent lockdown of the city. It is unlikely that plant operations will resume anytime soon.\nFtech\u2019s Wuhan plant currently produces brake pedals for Honda sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and supplies them to Honda factories in both China and Japan.

However, the production shift won\u2019t be permanent. The company intends to shift pedal production back to Wuhan when possible.

        "content": "Transmission of 2019-nCoV Infection from an Asymptomatic Contact in Germany To the Editor: The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Wuhan is currently causing concern in the medical community as the virus is spreading around the world. 1 Since its identification in late December 2019, the number of cases from China that have been imported into other countries is on the rise, and the epidemiologic picture is changing on a daily basis. We are reporting a case of 2019-nCoV infection acquired outside of Asia in which transmission appears to have occurred during the incubation period in the index patient. A 33-year-old otherwise healthy German businessman (Patient 1) became ill with a sore throat, chills, and myalgias on January 24, 2020. The following day, a fever of 39.1\u00b0C (102.4\u00b0F) developed, along with a productive cough. By the evening of the next day, he started feeling better and went back to work on January 27. Figure 1. Figure 1. Timeline of Exposure to Index Patient with Asymptomatic 2019-CoV Infection in Germany. Before the onset of symptoms, he had attended meetings with a Chinese business partner at his company near Munich on January 20 and 21. The business partner, a Shanghai resident, had visited Germany between Jan. 19 and 22. During her stay, she had been well with no signs or symptoms of infection but had become ill on her flight back to China, where she tested positive for 2019-nCoV on January 26 (index patient in Figure 1 ). On January 27, she informed the company about her illness. Contact tracing was started, and the above-mentioned colleague was sent to the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine in Munich for further assessment. At presentation, he was afebrile and well. He reported no previous or chronic illnesses and had no history of foreign travel within 14 days before the onset of symptoms. Two nasopharyngeal swabs and one sputum sample were obtained and were found to be positive for 2019-nCoV on quantitative reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. 2 Follow-up qRT-PCR assay revealed a high viral load of 10 8 copies per milliliter in his sputum during the following days, with the last available result on January 29. On January 28, three additional employees at the company tested positive for 2019-nCoV (Patients 2 through 4 in Figure 1 ). Of these patients, only Patient 2 had contact with the index patient; the other two patients had contact only with Patient 1. In accordance with the health authorities, all the patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection were admitted to a Munich infectious diseases unit for clinical monitoring and isolation. So far, none of the four confirmed patients show signs of severe clinical illness. This case of 2019-nCoV infection was diagnosed in Germany and transmitted outside of Asia. However, it is notable that the infection appears to have been transmitted during the incubation period of the index patient, in whom the illness was brief and nonspecific. 3 The fact that asymptomatic persons are potential sources of 2019-nCoV infection may warrant a reassessment of transmission dynamics of the current outbreak. In this context, the detection of 2019-nCoV and a high sputum viral load in a convalescent patient (Patient 1) arouse concern about prolonged shedding of 2019-nCoV after recovery. Yet, the viability of 2019-nCoV detected on qRT-PCR in this patient remains to be proved by means of viral culture. Despite these concerns, all four patients who were seen in Munich have had mild cases and were hospitalized primarily for public health purposes. Since hospital capacities are limited \u2014 in particular, given the concurrent peak of the influenza season in the northern hemisphere \u2014 research is needed to determine whether such patients can be treated with appropriate guidance and oversight outside the hospital.

At least nine people have died and hundreds more have been infected, including the first confirmed case in the U.S.\nThe level of alarm is rising as the coronavirus spreads. China said it will conduct nationwide screening and improve monitoring of transportation links for the Lunar New Year holidays, which start at the end of this week. That complicates efforts to contain the virus as hundreds of millions of people travel during the period, the biggest annual migration of humans on the planet. People found to have symptoms such as fever at travel checkpoints are being stopped from boarding planes and trains.\nHere\u2019s a look at how airports and airlines around the world are reacting:\nASIA\nHong Kong: The city\u2019s Airport Authority said planes arriving from Wuhan \u2014 roughly a two-hour flight away \u2014 will be parked at a designated area and that a cleaning contractor will disinfect the terminal where passengers are arriving from the city, which is the capital of Hubei province. Cleaning and disinfection in the airport will also be stepped up as a whole, it said. Flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., in response to complaints from its cabin crew union about risk of \u201ccatastrophic\" infection, on Wednesday said staff could wear protective face masks on flights to China if they wanted. The airline is also waiving rebooking, rerouting and refund charges for all tickets issued before Jan. 21 for travel to or from Wuhan between Jan. 21 and Feb. 15.\nKorea: Korean Air Lines Co. is providing hazardous-materials suits for crew on planes and plans to disinfect aircraft flying to Wuhan daily, as opposed to monthly. South Korea had its first confirmed infection on Monday.\nSingapore: Changi Airport is increasing surveillance on all passengers from China, rather than just those arriving from Wuhan. Low-cost carrier Scoot said it\u2019s made arrangements to distribute a health advisory to all passengers arriving from Wuhan. Disinfectants, hand sanitizers and surgical masks are being supplied on all China flights. Scoot said it has an aircraft disinfection protocol in place for flights where suspected cases have been reported.\nJapan: Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the country will step up quarantine and testing, while Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said Tuesday that health questionnaires would be given to passengers arriving from Wuhan by plane and that people should inform authorities if they\u2019re not feeling well on arrival.\nIndia: Mumbai\u2019s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharak International Airport has increased surveillance measures. Delhi Airport staff are checking inbound passengers from affected areas, it said in a statement.\nAustralia: Health authorities will help staff monitor travelers returning from Wuhan.\nIndonesia: Airports and airlines have been asked to take precautionary measures such as screening international passengers with thermal scanners. Airlines must provide health documents and manifests after landing, Director General of Civil Aviation Polana Pramesti said in a statement.\nVietnam: Equipment to measure body temperature is in place to screen passengers at Hanoi\u2019s Noi Bai International Airport, according to a statement on the government website, which said monitoring will be increased during the Lunar New Year holidays as there\u2019ll be a greater number of flights.\nEUROPE\nU.K.: Heathrow spokesman Weston Macklem said the airport was awaiting instructions from public health authorities. British Airways Plc said it\u2019s monitoring the situation closely.\nAMERICAS\nU.S.: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. implemented health screening for arrivals at airports in San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles on Jan. 17, and is expanding that to Atlanta and Chicago this week. CDC said it is closely monitoring the outbreak and there are ongoing investigations into the \u201crapidly evolving situation.\"",

        "content": "Corona Virus is gripping the world and is now an international crisis. Quora and facebook groups are full of questions from people who have booked various international trips, particularly South East Asia and wondering if they should cancel their trips or it is safe to proceed as per plan. Having booked flights, paid for hotels and tours, people are worried about cost of cancellation/loss if they don't travel now. I am not an expert in medicines or health matters. I don't know a lot about Corona virus except what I can find in media. With information available so far, I have put together my thoughts on upcoming travel. Can I travel as per plan? None of us can assure you that everything will be fine if you travel. People affected by Corona virus will not even know they are infected. You will not even realize you are sitting next to a person who is carrying the corona virus. So there is always a risk that you will get infected during your travel. Even worse, you may end up spreading the virus in your home, office or community without even knowing. When you travel, you will come close with other travelers in airport, in the plane, at immigration counter, at tourist places, in hotels and so on. So irrespective of how careful you are, there is a risk. So bottomline: Avoid all non essential travel. Even if it means losing some money on tickets and booking, the loss is not going to be as expensive as death. Will it be safe if I travel with a mask? Wearing a mask makes you lot safer, but masks are not 100% fool proof. You can't wear it 24x7- have to take it out while having food, drinking water and so on. Also we don't have a way to test the mask for purity, safety- it could be of inferior quality or might be housing pathogens. My travel is 2-3 months from now. Should I cancel? If travel date is months ahead, there isn't a need to panic and cancel everything right away. Wait for a month or two, or as long as your airline and hotel cancellation policy allows. It is possible that corona virus might get contained or a medicine is found. If the situation comes under control, it will be lot safer to travel. My travel is not to China or anywhere in Asia. Should I be still worried? Yes. The virus is being detected in countries all over the world. While rest of the world is lot safer than China and South East Asia, you might catch the virus at transit airport or destination immigration counter from someone returning from China to that country. So while it is relatively safer, it doesn't ensure 100% safety. Take a call depending on how crucial it is to travel. Image from Nepali Times . Unanswered Questions What are the early symptoms- how to tell for sure a person is possibly infected without medical tests All different mediums through which the corona virus can spread- By touch, in air, by contaminated food & water? How long should we wait? No one knows. We need to wait till either of the following happens 1. Corona virus stops spreading. Number of new cases and deaths reported begins to drop and we can be sure that quarantine has been successful. Once this happens it would be lot safer to head out. 2. A cure is found. If scientists can find an effective cure or antidote to help affected individuals recover to normalcy then we can feel safer to venture out, knowing that even if we are infected, we can recover. What if I have a work related travel? Can I refuse? You can definitely refuse to travel on work citing world wide crisis. Any sensitive employer will understand. Meetings can be done virtually, someone local can travel or non essential travel can be delayed by a month or two till we get better clarity. Can I fly within India? Very few cases are reported in India-so risk is very low. I believe it is reasonably safe to travel within India but exercise caution. If no new cases get reported in India over next few weeks, it will be lot safer. There is always risk in traveling. Aircraft may crash, terrorists may strike, hijack may happen, accidents happen. But probability of these occurrences are one in a million so there is no need to put off travel for fear of these issues. However corona virus case is bit different- we don't know if person next to us is infected, we don't have a cure and the virus is spreading fast all over the world- so the risks are higher and real. I am still keen to go. Shall I? If you have a strong appetite for risks or the travel is so important, go ahead and hope for the best. Many airlines are cutting flights to China but flights to other parts of the world are operating. While there is a risk, the probability is low as of now, so you might just get lucky.",

For now, we need to find ways to protect our healthcare workers who are on the front lines,\u201d he said.\nHotez praised China\u2019s efforts in dealing with the epidemic, saying Chinese scientists have done an amazing job so far figuring out the transmission and working out quickly the isolation and sequencing of the virus.\n\u201cThis is a testament to the power and strength of virology in China,\u201d he added.\nHowever, Hotez expressed his concern about person to person spread especially since the epidemic is expanding at the start of the Chinese New Year when the whole country is on the move.\n\u201cWe need to be concerned about travel in the coming days and weeks spreading this virus,\u201d he said.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) emergency committee convened on Wednesday on whether the latest novel coronavirus outbreak in China constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

        "content": "Camp beds set up for travelers returning to Germany from China, who will be isolated for two weeks to make sure they don\u2019t have coronavirus.\n\nThe recent global spread of a deadly coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China , has led world leaders to invoke an ancient tradition to control the spread of illness: quarantine.\nThe practice is first recorded in the Old Testament where several verses mandate isolation for those with leprosy . Ancient civilizations relied on isolating the sick, well before the actual microbial causes of disease were known. In times when treatments for illnesses were rare and public health measures few, physicians and lay leaders, beginning as early as the ancient Greeks , turned to quarantine to contain a scourge.\nIn January, Chinese authorities attempted to lock down millions of residents of Wuhan and the surrounding area, to try to keep the new coronavirus from spreading outward. The country\u2019s neighbors are closing borders , airlines are canceling flights , and nations are advising their citizens against traveling to China , a modern instance of the old impulse to restrict people\u2019s movements in order to stop disease transmission.\nU.S. authorities are holding travelers returning from China in isolation for two weeks as an effort to halt coronavirus\u2019 spread. Always at the center of the policy of quarantine is the tension between individual civil liberties and protection of the public at risk. Keeping contagion at bay\nThe meaning of quarantine has evolved from its original definition \u201cas the detention and segregation of subjects suspected to carry a contagious disease.\u201d\nNow it represents a period of isolation for persons or animals with a contagious disease \u2013 or who may have been exposed but aren\u2019t yet sick. Although in the past it may have been a self-imposed or voluntary separation from society, in more recent times quarantine has come to represent a compulsory action enforced by health authorities.\nLeprosy, mentioned in both Old and New testaments, is the first documented disease for which quarantine was imposed. In the Middle Ages, leper colonies, administered by the Catholic Church, sprung up throughout the world. Although the causative agent of leprosy \u2013 the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae \u2013 was not discovered until 1873 , its disfiguring and incurable nature made civilizations wrongly believe it was easily spread.\nThe plague of the 14th century gave rise to the modern concept of quarantine. The Black Death first appeared in Europe in 1347. Over the course of four years, it would kill between 40 million and 50 million people in Europe and somewhere between 75 million and 200 million worldwide. Now part of Croatia, Ragusa was in the Venetian Republic when it invented the 40-day quarantine to try to keep the plague out. Ratnakorn Piyasirisorost/Getty Images\nIn 1377, the seaport in Ragusa, modern day Dubrovnik, issued a \u201ctrentina\u201d \u2013 derived from the Italian word for 30 (trenta). Ships traveling from areas with high rates of plague were required to stay offshore for 30 days before docking. Anyone onboard who was healthy at the end of the waiting period was presumed unlikely to spread the infection and allowed onshore.\nThirty was eventually extended to 40 days, giving rise to the term quarantine, from the Italian word for 40 (quaranta). It was in Ragusa that the first law to enforce the act of quarantine was implemented.\nOver time, variations in the nature and regulation of quarantine emerged. Port officials asked travelers to certify they hadn\u2019t been to areas with severe disease outbreaks, before allowing them to enter. In the 19th century, quarantine was abused for political and economic reasons, leading to the call for international conferences to standardize quarantine practices. Cholera epidemics throughout the early 19th century made clear the lack of any uniformity of policy . Imported to America\nThe United States has also had its share of epidemics, beginning in 1793, with the outbreak of yellow fever in Philadelphia. A series of further disease outbreaks led Congress in 1878 to pass laws that mandated involvement of the federal government in quarantine. The arrival of cholera to the United States, in 1892, prompted even greater regulation . Officials quarantined \u2018Typhoid\u2019 Mary Mallon in a hospital. Wikimedia Commons\nPerhaps the best known example of quarantine in American history, pitting an individual\u2019s civil liberties against public protection, is the story of Mary Mallon , aka \u201cTyphoid Mary.\u201d An asymptomatic carrier of typhoid fever in the early 20th century, she never felt sick but nevertheless spread the disease to families for whom she worked as a cook.\nOfficials quarantined Mary on North Brother Island in New York City. Released after three years, she promised never to cook for anyone again. Breaking her vow and continuing to spread the disease, she was returned to North Brother Island, where she remained for the remainder of her life in isolation.\nMore recently, in 2007, public health officials quarantined a 31-year-old Atlanta attorney, Andrew Speaker , who was infected with a drug-resistant form of tuberculosis. His case grabbed international attention when he traveled to Europe, despite knowing he had and could spread this form of TB. Fearing quarantine in Italy, he returned to the United States, where he was apprehended by federal authorities and quarantined at a medical center in Denver, where he also received treatment. Following release, deemed no longer contagious, he was required to report to local health officials five days a week through the end of his treatment. Quarantine stations in the U.S. are staffed with quarantine medical and public health officers from the CDC. AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast\nQuarantine today continues as a public health measure to limit the spread of contagious disease, including not just coronavirus, but Ebola, flu and SARS .\nIts stigma has largely been removed by emphasizing not only the benefits of quarantine to society, by removing contagious individuals from the general population, but also the benefit of treatment to those who are ill.\nIn the United States, where the Constitution guarantees personal rights, it\u2019s a serious decision to restrict an individual\u2019s freedom of travel and compel medical treatment. And quarantine is not an ironclad way to prevent the spread of disease. But it can be a useful tool for public health officials working to stop the spread of a contagious disease.",

Beijing's local authorities have asked companies to work from home until Feb 10 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. More than 30 airlines have either suspended or reduced their flights to china and many companies have closed their offices till further notice.

Visitors who recently traveled to China are not allowed to enter Singapore due to the spread of coronavirus. The U.S will also limit flights from China to seven U.S. airports. Chinese Foreign Ministry has criticized the decision of US, noting that this behavior is certainly not a gesture of goodwill as they are neither factual nor appropriate. WHO has recommended against any travel restrictions in this public health emergency. The epicenter of the outbreak is anxiously waiting for two specialized coronavirus hospitals which will start taking patients on February 3 and 6 respectively. However, medical supplies are desperately needed in all the hospitals. Despite all the donations and round the clock production, country is not able to fulfil the gap between demand and supply. Due to the sheer number of infections, growing with every passing day, many countries including US are putting enrty restrictions on foreign nationals who have been to china in last 14 days. Even as experts say that infections cases are increasing due to effective testing and detection, situation remains grim and complicated. ",

There is no natural immunity to it, accounting for why it is spreading so fast amongst the human population 2. the virus is said to be a cross-species jump - DNA sequencing shows that it began as a virus in bats and crossed over to snakes and then made the jump to humans 3. it has a transmisivity rate of between 1.5 to 2.4 4. It is LETHAL Early data has shown that a little over 3% of those who contract it will succumb to it 5. the LATENCY WINDOW (PERIOD) of the virus is between 9 to 14 days This means, when someone contracts this virus they won't feel any symptoms, they won't feel sick from between 9 to 14 days after contracting it BUT during that period of time, they are INFECTING OTHERS. 6. the virus can be transmitted through the eyes as well as the mouth and the nose 7. the virus is NON-ENVLOPED so it can live for up to 5 days on the surface of the orifices ADVICE 1.

        "content": "Wuhan coronavirus comes from animals\nThere is only one health, and the world is unique to the viruses, bacteria and fungi that infect us.\n\u00abA single health\u00bb groups the study and the response to human health problems taking into account the problems of flora and fauna (animals, domesticated and wild) and the environment. This global vision is essential to understand the complex interaction of humans with their natural environment and with that modified by human activity itself.\nAlthough the virus could originate months before, the initial focus of the outbreak in the city of Wuhan (China) was located in the central seafood market, where wild animals were also sold (legal and illegal sale). There are coronaviruses in many mammals, from bats to dogs and humans. Some of the common cold virus are coronaviruses, for example.\nCoronaviruses have the ability to mutate and jump from animal to human. Wuhan\u2019s new coronavirus is spread like cold virus, but it seems not so easily. It produces flu-like symptoms and in some cases severe pneumonia that leads to death, especially in patients with major underlying diseases (for example, cancer with metastasis). Their mortality rate is 3% (3 people out of 100 infected die). There are other coronaviruses that produce similar cases to Wuhan\u2019s\nCoronaviruses have existed for thousands of years, but in the 21st century some new ones have appeared, not only Wuhan\u2019s. They could cause pneumonia and other complications that lead to death in some cases. In 2002-3, we had the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome known by its acronym SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). His mortality rate was 11% In 2012, the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome, known by its acronym in English MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). Its mortality rate was 36%. How have previous coronavirus outbreaks been controlled?\nThe best case-study is that of SARS in which about 8,000 cases were diagnosed in a total of 30 countries and did more than 700. The key thing was the prompt diagnosis and isolation of patients in hospitals, and of the contacts in their homes (voluntary quarantine). In the hospital, the spread of the virus was avoided with the usual hygienic measures. As in the MERS, was high the mortality that occurred in inpatient outbreaks. The treatment was supportive (fluids, oxygen, etc), with antibiotics for bacterial complications. Is a good idea placing millions of people in more than a dozen Chinese cities under intense travel restrictions?\nIn China, an attempt have being made to control the outbreak in Wuhan with the mandatory quarantine of millions of people, through the \u00abclosure\u00bb of several cities, cutting the connections by air and land. This mandatory quarantine is an expression, at the same time, of a dictatorial state and a weak health system, especially as regards to the control of infectious diseases. In general, mandatory quarantines are no evidence based. Health screening strategies for international air travelers\nExperience shows that temperature controls are not useful. They have no sense the \u00abscreenings\u00bb at arrival airports. What works are screenings (questionnaires PLUS temperature control) in exit airports, before departure from the affected country.\nTake into account that you can be infected with coranovirus and have no symptoms, but transmit it and hence the value of the questionnaires at the airport of departure. How to protect yourself and others?\nThere are currently no vaccines available to protect you against human coronavirus infection. There are no specific treatments for illnesses caused by human coronaviruses. In case of mild disease just follow the usual behaviour in a common cold.\nAccording to the CDC advises, you may be able to reduce your risk of infection by doing the following: 1. wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds 2. avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands 3. avoid close contact with people who are sick\nIf you have cold-like symptoms, you can help protect others by doing the following; stay home while you are sick 1. avoid close contact with others 2. cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands 3. clean and disinfect objects and surfaces\nYou don\u2019t have to take special precautions with animals, or with food.\nAt this time it is more important to control panic than to control deaths.\nContinuous mistakes are being made, as I have already noted: 1. forced quarantine of millions of people 2. controls at arrival airports 3. border closures 4. suspension of communications, and 5. ignorance of panic dynamics\nThe key questions in the outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus (as in general for infections) is to have a well developed disease control system and a good health system with universal coverage. There is neither vaccine nor specific treatment for Wuhan\u2019s coronavirus but the situation is much better than in the SARS outbreak, due to the lower mortality rate (3 vs. 11%). Is there a Cochrane Review about physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses?\nYes. This is the summary: \u00abRespiratory virus spread can be reduced by hygienic measures (such as handwashing), especially around younger children. Frequent handwashing can also reduce transmission from children to other household members. Implementing barriers to transmission, such as isolation, and hygienic measures (wearing masks, gloves and gowns) can be effective in containing respiratory virus epidemics or in hospital wards. We found no evidence that the more expensive, irritating and uncomfortable N95 respirators were superior to simple surgical masks. It is unclear if adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing with soap is more effective. There is insufficient evidence to support screening at entry ports and social distancing (spatial separation of at least one metre between those infected and those non-infected) as a method to reduce spread during epidemics\u201d.\nSo you may see that Cochrane recomends the use of facemask and the CDC no. What to do? An interesting and very well done study ends supporting the CDC position: \u201cFacemask use does not prevent clinical or laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections among Hajj pilgrims\u201d (pilgrims gathering in Mecca for Hajj pilgr). Suspect case\nIf the patient satisfies general AND clinical criteria, they are classified as a suspect case.\nGeneral criteria 1. travel from Hubei Province, China in the 14 days before the onset of illness or travel to agreed areas of human-to-human transmission, or a declared outbreak, within 14 days before onset of illness, or 2. close contact with a confirmed case of 2019-nCoV within the last 14 days.\nClinical criteria 1. fever or history of fever and acute respiratory infection (sudden onset of respiratory infection with at least one of: shortness of breath, cough or sore throat), or 2. severe acute respiratory infection requiring admission to hospital with clinical or radiological evidence of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (i.e. even if no evidence of fever)\nA close contact is defined as requiring greater than 15 minutes face-to-face contact with a confirmed case in any setting, or the sharing of a closed space with a confirmed case for a prolonged period (e.g. more than 2 hours). In summary\nCoronaviruses have been with us for thousands of years, and we are prepared to overcome their infections.\nIf you have traveled to Wuhan (China) or have had close contact with those who have traveled there and have severe catarrhal symptoms with respiratory distress, consult your doctor especially if you have any underlying disease.\nIn all other cases avoid a panic epidemic, be prudent.\n",

        "content": "The New infectious disease, the Novel Corona Virus that originated in the Wuhan region of China, is a real gamechanger amongst infectious diseases. The more we hear about it, the more it seems the \"precautions\" advised by the World Health Organisation and the various foreign governments are following the curve, rather than ahead of it. Standard procedures for this sort of thing used in the past for the SARS and MARS outbreaks don't work with NCoV. Both SARS and MARS weren't infectious until symptoms emerged. That's why an effective method of spotting infected cases at airports and the like was to use temperature sensors. The first scary thing with NCoV is that those sort of checks don't work with NCoV. Patients are without symptoms (asymptomatic) and still infectious. So a carrier can walk around without a temperature, or a cough or any other symptoms and still spread the virus. That means the virus is hard to contain. If it's spread without symptoms, ANYONE could be a carrier no matter how healthy they look or feel. The only way to contain it is to contain and isolate the area of the outbreak. For cases that arrive in new countries, the only effective way to contain the virus is to close down the area around the cases and let the virus run it's course. The current practice of taking patients to hospitals outside the infected area is bad. Believe me, it's very bad. You just end up creating new hotspots. Travel into and out of infected areas should be stopped. In the UK we've already seen how a person can pick up the virus in an area away from the initial outbreak (in this case Singapore), then flew to France (possibly infecting a new bunch of people on that flight), he then stopped off in France infecting a whole ski-chalet's worth of people, one of whom flew back to Spain (again possibly infecting a flight's worth of people). The Brit then climbed aboard an EasyJet flight back to the UK, most likely infecting another bunch of people because by now we know he was infectious from the cases in France. The Brit then infected another person in the UK. There's now a link with a Doctor's surgery in Brighton and a school in Southampton. The details are sketchy at the moment, but if this is true, then the virus is already out in the wild in the UK. We may never isolate the virus or stop it from spreading. Not without drastic measures. But even if this person infected 10, 20, 30 or even a hundred people on the flights he took between countries and then infected a bunch more wherever he landed, this UK case proves the infectious nature of the virus. The WHO infection rating of 2-3 is way off the mark. How many other people will these new infections go on to infect? The second scary thing about NCoV is that if you are infected and survive, unlike the flu, you don't get immunity. China has already reported instances of re-infection. Whether this is just people with colds wrongly diagnosed as NCoV sufferers going on to contract NCo after being dragged onto plague wards with NCoV sufferers, or whether it truly is re-infectious we have yet to really confirm. But governments should be treating it like it is. The best defence is not to get infected, so isolation of infected areas needs to happen and happen quick. The thing is, if the virus is re-infectious and kills off a small percentage of it's victims. You can be in the first wave and survive, a small percentage dies. In the second wave of re-infections, another small percentage dies off. But if you don't get immunity from previous infection, that cycle continues until there is no-one to infect. EVERYONE DIES FROM NCoV EVENTUALLY. The third scary thing about NCoV is (and it is only supposition at the moment), but if satellite pictures coming out of Wuhan are correct, there is a chance that even dead bodies are infectious. It seems that China may now be burning dead bodies on a large scale. This suggest that even dead bodies are not safe to handle and the only way to \"sterilise\" them is to burn them. That suggests the virus can live without the host being alive for some time. A very scary thought. Not only for the management of the bodies of victims, but also for the spread of the virus. If it can live on without a live host, then it can live on door handles and other public surfaces for some time and be passed onto people without direct contact. The Final scary thing is the incubation period seems to be very long. Initially it was thought to be 12-14 days before patients exhibited symptoms. But reports suggest that patients can actually go as long as 24 days without exhibiting symptoms but still be infectious. So in China, patient that had been released from quarantine after not exhibiting symptoms, went on to not only become symptomatic, but also infect any close contacts at the same time. The more information we get about NCoV the more scary it gets. The more it seems a very efficient virus. Spreading easily, hardy enough to infect without direct contact and able to re-infect. Fatal in a small number of cases, but with the ability to re-infect ad-infinitum and chip away at the numbers of victims until there are no hosts left. The amazing thing is I see no action from governments to get a handle on the problem. Right now, the situation is fluid and the more we hear about NCoV, the more it seems the \"standard\" precautions are inadequate. If I was an isolated country with no cases, somewhere like Iceland, I'd close the borders now. No-one in or out. No flights, no boats, nothing. If necessary for up to 6 months. Let the rest of the world find out how infectious the disease is and how deadly it is. For the rest of us, well only time will tell. Hopefully on one of the waves of infection the virus will mutate into a harmless version, or possibly it mutates into a version that allows our immune system to recognise the virus and create some immunity. Without it and without some pretty serious quarantine measures, we are pretty much toast. We certainly need to get some truthful and open information from the Chinese authorities about numbers of infections, mortality rates, infection rating, re-infections rates, incubation period, longevity out of the body and other information about the virus, otherwise how could we hope to ever contain it. W eneed to be ahead of the information curve, not behind it. A final note is about the conspiracy theories about NCoV, especially the rumours about it being a Bioweapon accidentally released. It has all the hallmarks of one: being hard to spot, hard to contain, highly infectious, hardy and finally fatal. But a natural-occurring virus transferring between species also has the same traits. Normally a virus doesn't kill it's host and probably in the original carrier (Supposedly Bats) and probably in the host organism it doesn't kill them all off. But when transferring to humans, there is no such guarantee. The virus could wipe out this new host quite easily, unless it has the chance to mutate into a less deadly version, or something happens to trigger our immune system to fight it off. It's not necessarily the trait of a bioweapon, just the risk you take when you transfer a disease from one host to another. Bad animal husbandry is a very effective way to initiate this transfer between species. Just remember that the next time you eat one of your eggs from a battery hen... UPDATE Doing a mental exercise here: just think if the Government gave out advice to anyone in contact with an NCoV carrier to self-quarantine. Who would pay their wages while they were waiting the two weeks or a month to see if they had contracted the virus? How would the government stop or encourage people to stay indoors? Given the severity of the virus and the infectious nature, surely another step for the government would be to underwrite any loss in pay and/or benefits for those that had to self-quarantine? Otherwise people will just go to work as normal. ",

Cornoviruses form a large family of viruses and the illness they cause can range from common cold to more severe diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).\nThese viruses are zoonotic, which means they are transmitted from animals to humans.\nWhile the exact source (i.e. the animal from which it started) of 2019-nCoV is yet to be identified, other strains of coronoviruses have previously been seen to be transmitted from civet cats to humans (in the case of SARS-CoV) and from dromedary camels to humans (in the case of MERS-CoV). What Can 2019-nCoV DO?\nSince this is the first time 2019-nCoV is reported to have infected humans, there is limited information on the exact range of illness the virus can cause. Its effects can range from cough and fever to kidney failure and even death.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has listed the following common signs observed in people infected by 2019-novel Coronavirus:\nFever, Cough, Shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, Pneumonia, Severe acute respiratory syndrome, Kidney failure , Death PRECAUTIONS YOU MUST TAKE\nMuch remains to be known about how exactly the 2019-nCoV infection t ransmits between humans and animals, and the extent of human-to-human transmissions.\nThe WHO has issued an advisory to reduce risk among those travelling from or to the affected regions. As per WHO, you should observe the following precautions:\nAvoid close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections\nWash hands frequently , especially if there is a direct contact will ill people or exposure to their environment\nAvoid close contact with live or dead farm and wild animals\nIf you have symptoms of acute respiratory infection , you should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover cough and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing and wash hands).\nIf you are visiting a live animal market, a wet market or any animal product market, practice general hygiene like regular hand washing with soap and potable water after touching animals and animal products.\nAvoid touching eyes , nose or mouth with hands and avoid any contact with sick animals or spoiled animal products.\nAvoid consuming raw or under cooked animal products and handle raw meat and milk with care.

We cannot allow that to happen.\"\nDuring the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009, there was criticism that distribution of vaccines was not equitable as wealthier countries were able to purchase more.\n\"We must make sure that people who need them get them,\" said Peter Sands, head of the Global Fund to Fight on AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. \"The lessons from AIDS must be learned. Too many millions died before anti-retroviral medicines were made widely accessible.\"\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the objective at a global pledging effort on May 4 would be to raise 7.5 billion euros ($8.10 billion) to ramp up work on prevention, diagnostics and treatment.\n\"This is a first step only, but more will be needed in the future,\" von der Leyen told the conference.\n\"COMMON FIGHT\"\nLeaders from Asia, the Middle East and the Americas also joined the videoconference, but several big countries did not participate, including China, India and Russia.\nA spokesman for the U.S. mission in Geneva had earlier told Reuters that the United States would not be involved.\n\"Although the United States was not in attendance at the meeting in question, there should be no doubt about our continuing determination to lead on global health matters, including the current COVID crisis,\" he said by email.\n\"We remain deeply concerned about the WHO's effectiveness, given that its gross failures helped fuel the current pandemic,\" he later said.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has lambasted the WHO as being slow to react to the outbreak and being \"China-centric\" and announced a suspension of funding.\nTedros has steadfastly defended the WHO's handling of the pandemic and repeatedly committed to conducting a post-pandemic evaluation, as the agency does with all crises.\nMacron, Merkel, Ramaphosa, and Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez were among those voicing strong support to WHO.\nMacron urged all G7 and G20 countries to get behind the initiative, adding: \"And I hope we'll manage to reconcile around this joint initiative both China and the U.S., because this is about saying 'the fight against COVID-19 is a common human good and there should be no division in order to win this battle'.\"\nMerkel said: \"This concerns a global public good, to produce this vaccine and to distribute it in all parts of the world.\"\nRamaphosa, chairman of the African Union, warned that the continent - with its generally poor standards of healthcare - was \"extremely vulnerable to the ravages of this virus and is in need of support\".\nVACCINE TRIALS\nMore than 2.7 million people have been infected with COVID-19 and nearly 190,000 have died from it since the new coronavirus emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, according to a Reuters tally.\n\"As new diagnostics, treatments and vaccines become available, we have a responsibility to get them out equitably with the understanding that all lives have equal value,\" said Melinda Gates, co-chair of the Gates Foundation, which was WHO's second largest donor last year.\nMore than 100 potential COVID-19 vaccines are being developed, including six already in clinical trials, said Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of the GAVI vaccine alliance, a public-private partnership that leads immunisation campaigns in poor countries.\n\"We need to ensure that there are enough vaccines for everyone, we are going to need global leadership to identify and prioritise vaccine candidates,\" he told a Geneva news briefing.\nYuan Qiong, senior legal and policy advisor at Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) Access Campaign welcomed the pledges but called for concrete steps. \"There shouldn't be any patent monopoly and profiteering out of this pandemic,\" she told Reuters.",

The current one is likely temporary, said Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\u201cOnce people have a chance to catch their breath, it might be changed,\\\" Messonnier said.\nMany media outlets have been skipping the clunky 2019 nCoV and just calling it the new virus or new coronavirus, which isn't very specific. Coronavirus is the umbrella term for a large group of viruses , including the one that causes the common cold.\nSince the outbreak is centered in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, others have been using Wuhan virus or Wuhan coronavirus or even Wuhan flu\u2014even though flu is an entirely different virus.\nIt's consistent with a centuries-old tradition of naming new ailments after cities, countries, or regions of the world where they first popped up. West Nile was first detected in the West Nile district of Uganda; Lyme disease in Old Lyme, Conn.; and Ebola in a village near Africa's Ebola River.\nBut that can sometimes be wrong or misleading. The 1918 pandemic was called Spanish flu, though researchers don't think Spain is where it actually started.\n\u201cNow we have a much different sensibility and tolerance about how we refer to things,\u201d said Dr. Howard Markel , a medical historian at the University of Michigan.\nIn 2015, the World Health Organization issued guidelines that discouraged the use of geographic locations (like Zika virus), animals (swine flu), or groups of people (Legionnaires' disease).\nHoppe noted that AIDS, when it first emerged in the early 1980s, was called \u201cgay-related immune deficiency.\\\" That was dropped as it became clear that heterosexuals were also spreading the virus. AIDS stands for acquired immune deficiency syndrome.\nWith the guidelines, WHO was trying to bring an end to unnecessary stigma that could ostracize people and damage business. Demand for pork plunged in 2009 with so-called swine flu, first identified in a boy who lived on a pig farm in Mexico\u2014even though it wasn't spread through eating pork.\nMarkel said he liked when diseases were named after the scientists who first described them. (Think Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Tourette.) That was once common but may be more problematic today with scientists across the world working on a new ailment at the same time.\nAs for the new virus, \u201cI can see why they want to name it something generic but it has to be something people use,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise the easier name will take over, and it's naive to think otherwise.\\\"\nIn the end, the WHO may have little control over what it's called, he added.\n\u201c'Wuhan virus' is very catchy\u2014no pun intended,\\\" Markel said. \u201cIt's a very contagious name.\u201d\n \u2014 Coronavirus forces China\u2019s neighbors to make tough choices\n\u2014 Asia worries about big events like the Olympics amid coronavirus spread\n\u2014China will struggle to spend its way out of the coronavirus economic slowdown\n\u2014On facial recognition , Berlin and London choose different paths\n\u2014Fortune Explains: Tariffs and trade wars\nCatch up with Data Sheet , Fortune\u2019s daily digest on the business of tech.",

        "content": "A Chinese doctor who got in trouble with authorities in the communist country for sounding an early warning about the coronavirus outbreak died after coming down with the illness Friday, a hospital reported.\nThe Wuhan Central Hospital said on its social media account that Dr. Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old ophthalmologist, was \u201cunfortunately infected during the fight against the pneumonia epidemic of the new coronavirus infection.\u201d\n\u201cWe deeply regret and mourn this,\u201d it added.\nLi was reprimanded by local police for \u201cspreading rumors\u201d about the illness in late December, according to news reports. The outbreak, centered in Wuhan, has now infected over 28,200 people globally and killed more than 560.\nThe World Health Organization tweeted: \u201cWe are deeply saddened by the passing of Dr Li Wenliang. We all need to celebrate work that he did\u201d on the virus.\nWithin a half-hour of announcing earlier Friday that Li was in critical condition, the hospital received nearly 500,000 comments on its social media post, many of them from people hoping Li would pull through. One wrote: \u201cWe are not going to bed. We are here waiting for a miracle.\u201d\nMeanwhile, a newborn became the youngest known person infected with the virus. China finished building a second new hospital Thursday to isolate and treat patients and moved people with milder symptoms into makeshift quarantine centers at sports arenas, exhibition halls and other public spaces. And testing of a new antiviral drug was set to begin on patients.\nRising toll and youngest victim While the overwhelming majority of deaths and infections haven been in China, more than 200 people with the illness have been reported in over two dozen other countries, including Japan, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea and the United States.\nChina\u2019s National Health Commission said the number of infected patients who were \u201cdischarged and cured\u201d stood at 1,153. No details were given, but milder cases have been seen in younger, healthier people.\nThe youngest patient is a baby born Saturday in Wuhan and confirmed positive just 36 hours after birth, authorities said.\n\u201cThe baby was immediately separated from the mother after the birth and has been under artificial feeding. There was no close contact with the parents, yet it was diagnosed with the disease,\u201d Zeng Lingkong, director of neonatal diseases at Wuhan Children\u2019s Hospital, told Chinese TV.\nZeng said other infected mothers have given birth to babies who tested negative, so it is not yet known if the virus can be transmitted in the womb. That \u201cneeds further study,\u201d he said.\nThe new virus is in the coronavirus family that includes MERS and SARS, and it causes fever, cough, shortness of breath and, in severe cases, pneumonia.\nMore hospital beds A 1,500-bed hospital specially built to deal with the outbreak was completed in Wuhan, days after a 1,000-bed hospital with prefabricated wards and isolation rooms began taking patients.\nWuhan is also operating an additional 132 quarantine sites with more than 12,500 beds, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.\nAuthorities are racing to increase the number of beds in Wuhan and the rest of hard-hit Hubei province, where the health care system has been so overwhelmed that some sick people have been turned away from hospitals and sent home, raising the risk of their spreading the virus to others.\nAll together, more than 50 million people are under virtual quarantine in Hubei in an unprecedented \u2014 and unproven \u2014 bid to bring the outbreak under control.\nIn Hong Kong, hospital workers demanding a shutdown of the territory\u2019s border with mainland China were on strike for a fourth day.\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced a 14-day quarantine of all travelers entering the city from the mainland starting Saturday, but the government has refused to seal the border entirely.\nQuarantined cruise ships Two docked cruise ships with thousands of passengers and crew members remained under 14-day quarantines in Hong Kong and Japan.\nTen passengers confirmed to have the virus were escorted off the Diamond Princess at the port of Yokohama near Tokyo, after 10 others were taken off the previous day. Those taken to hospitals Thursday were mostly in their 60s and 70s, four of them Japanese, two Americans, two Canadians, one New Zealander and one Taiwanese.\nTests were still pending on others on board who had symptoms or contact with infected people.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be like a floating prison,\u201d passenger David Abel lamented on Facebook. He had set out on a 50th wedding anniversary luxury cruise but found himself in his cabin, eating a \u201clettuce sandwich with some chicken inside.\u201d\nMore than 3,600 people on the other quarantined ship, the World Dream, underwent screening after eight passengers were diagnosed with the virus.\nNew drug Xinhua said that clinical trials for the antiviral drug Remdesivir have been approved and that the first group of patients was expected to start taking it on Thursday. It is made by U.S. biotech company Gilead Sciences.\nAntivirals and other drugs can reduce the severity of an illness, but \u201cso far, no antivirals have been proven effective\u201d against the new virus, said Thanarak Plipat, deputy director-general of Thailand\u2019s Disease Control Department in the Health Ministry. He said there are a lot of unknowns, \u201cbut we have a lot of hope as well.\u201d\nMore fallout From Europe to Australia and the U.S., universities that host Chinese students or have study-abroad programs are scrambling to assess the risks, and some are canceling opportunities and prohibiting student travel.\nCentral banks in the Philippines and Thailand have cut their interest rates to fend off economic damage from the outbreak in China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, with 1.4 billion people. China is a major source of tourists in Asia, and corporations around the world depend on its factories to supply products and its consumers to buy them.\nThe organizers of the Tokyo Olympics again sought to allay fears that the 2020 Games could be postponed or canceled because of the crisis.",

But if there really is a need, we have also provided a hotline for all Chinese citizens who are abroad, so our 24 hours active, \u201che explained.\nIn the future, according to Haodong, if there is still a need or desire from tourists from China who still want to go home, he will consider and then return to take care of the pickup permit. \u201cSo out of these 3 thousand Chinese tourists, they come from various provinces that are from China, so now there are flight delays, but if in the future there is still a need, we will consider again for pick-up,\u201d he explained.\nOn that occasion, he also expressed his enormous gratitude to the Balinese people for being very friendly to tourists from China amid the corona virus contents that keep on blowing. \u201cI had a chance to talk to Chinese tourists and they said that they really liked Bali, so they said they were going to Bali again, \u201che said.

        "content": "Japanese living in Beijing grapple with coronavirus outbreak\nWhat are the symptoms?\nCommon symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath and respiratory issues. In severe cases an infection can lead to kidney failure, pneumonia and even death.\nSymptoms of 2019-nCoV may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure, according to health authorities.\nHow does it spread?\nAs seen in the case involving a tour bus driver in Nara who had transported visitors from Wuhan, the new strain of coronavirus can be transmitted from person to person, especially as a result of close contact with an infected patient in a household, office or hospital.\nCoughing and sneezing are thought to contribute to the spread of the virus. Time and distance also matter. Viruses can typically be spread through the surfaces upon which droplets of saliva, mucus or other bodily fluids land. Many dry out and cease to be infectious if left for too long. But the properties of 2019-nCoV itself remains unclear.\nHow can it be prevented?\nTo reduce the likeliness of infection, people are being advised to wash their hands regularly, cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, make sure they fully cook meat and eggs and avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms.\nThe Foreign Ministry is asking people not to travel to Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan. Travelers are also being asked to exercise caution when traveling to China.\nIs there a vaccine or treatment?\nNo. Researchers are only beginning to understand the nature of this new strain of the virus. There is no treatment for a disease caused by a novel coronavirus, but symptoms can be treated and supportive care for infected people has been shown to be highly effective, according to the World Health Organization.\nStill, while it can usually take months or even years to develop a vaccine, the U.S. is aiming to test the first of a number of experimental vaccines within three months. It took scientists 20 months to begin human trials following the 2003 outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome).\nIn China, HIV drugs are being employed in the interim to treat pneumonia caused by the coronavirus as the country\u2019s National Health Commission works on developing a vaccine.

According to official figures, the total number of people infected with the virus in China is 5,974. There are almost 10,000 suspected cases. The deaths are mostly older patients with previous illnesses.\nOutside the People\u2019s Republic, there are also people with the new virus in Thailand, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, the United States, Australia and South Korea. Four infections were confirmed in Germany. The three new cases that came to light on Tuesday evening are related to the first patient in Bavaria who contracted a colleague from China. Search for vaccine: reproduction of the virus in the laboratory succeeded\nDoctors and scientists around the world are feverishly looking for an antidote to curb the epidemic: A team of Australian scientists has successfully reproduced the coronavirus in the laboratory. The breakthrough could help combat the global spread of the disease. \u201cWith the real virus, we now have the opportunity to validate and verify all test methods and compare their sensitivities and special features,\u201d said Julian Druce, head of the virus identification laboratory at the Peter Doherty Institute in Melbourne. The cultured virus sample can thus help in the development of a vaccine.\nIn the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, a media report has started clinical trials on the possible use of HIV drugs against the virus. The state-sponsored financial newspaper \u201cSecurities Times\u201d reported, citing an official from the National Health Commission. The most important developments regarding the course of the epidemic at a glance: Four cases of the coronavirus have now been confirmed in Germany, and four sick people have also been reported in France. The latest case there is an elderly Chinese tourist whose condition is described as critical. No new cases have occurred in the United States. According to the supplier Webasto, which is affected by illnesses, BMW, Thyssen-Krupp and Volkswagen have initially restricted or prohibited a travel ban to China, especially to the regions affected. For fear of global expansion, the government in Beijing on Tuesday recommended all Chinese to refrain from traveling abroad for the time being. \u201cIf there is no particular need, it is recommended to postpone the time of the trip,\u201d warned China\u2019s administration for entry and exit. Hong Kong wants to largely close its border with the People\u2019s Republic. All train and ferry connections will be cut off at midnight on Thursday. Cases have also been confirmed in Taiwan. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has praised Chinese activities since the outbreak of the new lung disease. \u201cWe appreciate how seriously China is taking the outbreak, especially the commitment of the highest leadership,\u201d said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in Beijing on Tuesday. China will also let WHO experts into the country. Two planes are designed to pull hundreds of EU citizens out of the region most affected by the corona virus in China. According to the EU Commission, the first plane is due to start in France on Wednesday morning and fly around 250 Frenchmen home. The second plane is slated to follow later this week, bringing more than 100 Europeans home from other EU countries. The international travel trade fair ITB has so far found no uncertainty among exhibitors for the industry meeting at the beginning of March because of the corona virus. \u201cSo far, no one has raised concerns or canceled his participation,\u201d said a spokeswoman on Tuesday on request. The ITB is fully booked with around 10,000 exhibitors. A total of 0.6 percent from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan would have agreed. Markets on both sides of the Atlantic were relieved by WHO\u2019s praise for China\u2019s disease control measures. What else you should know:\nStarbucks claims to have closed half of its stores in China. Since the financial consequences of the outbreak are not yet foreseeable, it will only be possible to present its forecast for the 2020 financial year at a later date.\nA plane with US citizens on board flew off in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. The charter flight started on Wednesday morning (local time), as confirmed by circles from the State Department. The first stop should be Anchorage in Alaska.\nThe outbreak of the corona virus in China also concerns the International Olympic Committee. \u201cThe IOC is in contact with the World Health Organization (WHO) and its own experts,\u201d said the German Press Agency at the request of half a year before the Tokyo Games began. \u201cMeasures against contagious diseases are an important part of the Tokyo 2020 plans to offer safe games.\nSpanish authorities have reassured residents of Andalusia of a training camp for football team Wuhan Zall. The team from the Chinese Super League comes from the region that is particularly affected by the new corona virus. According to the Spanish authorities, the team had not been to Wuhan since January 2. Instead, she prepared in Guanghzou \u2013 around 1000 kilometers away.\nThe US airline United Airlines is canceling some flights between the USA and Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai from February 1 to 8. The reason is \u201ca significant decline in demand\u201d, says a statement. 24 flights are affected. The US Disease Centers (CDC) announce an expansion of airport controls. The number of airports covered should be increased to 20 out of five. The agency also said there is currently no evidence of the disease spreading within the United States. ",

The question is, how to better protect our selves and our loved ones from possible infection? The answer or I should say part of the solution is in washing hands often, The CDC recommends washing hands often in order to reduce the risk of infection. Think about how many things we touch in a single day. The gas pump and the credit card machines, the elevator buttons, all of the buttons at the self checkout at the grocery store. The grocery cart, door handles, faucets, our cell phones, computer keys, handles, money, we touch and handle things in the store all the time. The list goes on and on and we don't even think about the fact that infection is easily spread this way.\u201d\nChaplain Paul was also Quote: d saying, \u201cIf you or someone in your family is dealing with the flu then it wouldn't hurt to have that person were a surgical mask and gloves. This helps to reduce the spread of infection in hospitals. If you or someone in your family works in a nursing home or hospital setting then have them remove their shoes when they return home. Use bleach wipes to disinfect shoes. Wipe down all can goods, bottles, and containers before bringing them into your home.\u201d\nChaplain Paul was also Quote: d saying, \u201cWash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands often, as a Community Chaplain I see all often how easy infection spreads in a hospital setting. Remember try not to cough or sneeze into your hands, stay home if you are sick. Do not visit anyone in a hospital or nursing home setting if you are sick or even have a cold. Above all pray for God's guidance, protection and love in these matters and remember what Proverbs 3:5-6 teaches, Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your paths...

Corona beer is a pleasant pale ale noted for its summery vibe.\nApparently many people are unclear on the differences between them, according to a report from USA Today. That&apos;s why Corona beer has faced some unusual search engine action, with people seeking terms like \"corona beer virus\" and \"beer virus.\"\nMore, from USA Today :\nIn the United States, Google Trends calculated that 57% of the people that searched one of those terms searched for \u201cbeer virus,\u201d and the remaining 43% searched for \u201ccorona beer virus.\u201d\nStates like Hawaii, New Mexico and Kansas are searching \"beer virus\" more, whereas states like South Carolina, Colorado and Arizona are searching \"corona beer virus\" more.\nThis is a weird misunderstanding for a lot of reasons, one of them being alcoholic beverages aren&apos;t friendly to germs . But of course, coronavirus is to blame. As Google noted in a tweet, searches for a wide variety of related terms have spiked in a huge way.\nWhy all the fuss, though? It&apos;s simple: this particular coronavirus is apparently brand new. The common cold is usually a type of coronavirus, but over time science has managed to catalog many of the bugs typically affecting humans.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explains :\n2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus ) identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread.\nHowever, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. At this time, it\u2019s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people. The latest situation summary updates are available on CDC\u2019s web page 2019 Novel Coronavirus, Wuhan, China .\nThe bug is easily passed along via coughing and sneezing as well as touch. MedicineNet lists some of the potential complications :\ndifficulty breathing (may require a breathing machine), high fever, pneumonia, severe cough, organ failure (for example, kidney failure), and. death. Don&apos;t get it twisted: You won&apos;t get any of that from beer.\nUSA Today didn&apos;t get a comment on this ridiculous confusion from Constellation Brands, the company that makes Corona beer, but it&apos;s easy to believe they&apos;d really like the medical establishment to rename this bug if possible.\nSeriously, though\u2014as of January 30, 2020, the New York Times was reporting that the coronavirus had killed a minimum of 170 people worldwide and infected nearly 8,000. The first infection on US soil had been confirmed as well, a Chinese national who was visiting Chicago from her native city of Wuhan, where the virus reportedly originated.\n",

So has Australia.\nWhen Business in Vancouver asked Transport Canada whether Canada would follow suit, Health Canada sent back a statement saying, \"No. The government of Canada and the provinces and territories have multiple systems in place to prepare for, detect and respond to prevent the spread of serious infectious diseases in Canada.\"\nAir Canada (TSX:AC) has indefinitely cancelled all 33 weekly flights between Canada and Beijing and Shanghai because of what the airline said was diminished demand.\nDozens of other airlines around the world have cancelled flights to China, but it was unclear at press time whether Air China, China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, Beijing Capital Airlines, Sichuan Airlines, Xiamen Airlines or Hainan Airlines would follow suit and cancel non-stop flights between Vancouver International Airport and mainland China.\nChina has, however, banned companies within its borders from arranging outbound group tours.\n\u201cChina is certainly an important market,\u201d Tourism Vancouver acting CEO Ted Lee told BIV . \u201cThey are obviously big spenders but in terms of overall volume [travel from China] is not hugely significant.\u201d\nTourism Vancouver data showed 323,629 Chinese citizens stayed overnight in Metro Vancouver in 2018. That was about 3% of the 10,761,124 overnight visitors to the region that year. About 57.5% of the region\u2019s overnight visitors that year were Canadian while 23.2% of those visitors were American.\nLee is urging hoteliers to waive cancellation fees for those affected, and many are already doing that.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to say that we\u2019re waiving cancellation fees across the board but we\u2019re working with people who need to alter their stay,\u201d said Fairmont Hotel Vancouver general manager Adam Laker.\nHis hotel is also \u201cshowing leniency\u201d even to visitors who booked fixed stays, he said, adding that alterations so far have been for individual travellers and not Chinese tour groups.\nOne fear is that the coronavirus outbreak could resemble the spread of the SARS virus in 2003, when dozens of people died in Toronto and convention organizers cancelled events.\nConvention organizers have an outsized influence on the tourism sector, said tourism consultant Lyle Hall.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m the International Widget Association, and I have an event booked for Vancouver, and there\u2019s a health crisis, I have to make a decision on whether or not to hold that event, and my decision has in the balance whether 1,000 people will show up,\u201d he explained.\nHall produced reports on the economic impact of the SARS crisis in 2003 and found that tourism revenues in Vancouver fell 10%, or $57 million, in the three months that ended May 31, 2003, compared with the same months in the previous year. Toronto\u2019s tourism revenues fell 29%, or $186 million, over the same time period.\nA Conference Board of Canada report in May 2003 similarly found that Canada\u2019s tourism sector was walloped hard by a general panic provoked by the SARS virus.\nIt suggested that Toronto suffered a $950 million (0.5%) hit to real gross domestic product and that $570 million of that decline was concentrated in the travel and tourism sector.\nThat report noted domestic overnight travel to Toronto in the second quarter of 2003 was down 15%, while U.S. overnight travel to Toronto was down 20% and overseas overnight travel to Toronto was down 40%.\nRoyal Roads University tourism professor Rod Harris, who was CEO of the now-defunct destination tourism marketing organization Tourism BC during the SARS crisis, said larger cities are likely to feel a bigger impact from reduced tourism from China than smaller ones because Chinese visitors to B.C. tend to travel to places such as Vancouver and Victoria.\n\u201cVisitors from Europe \u2013 Germany or Switzerland \u2013 tend to stay longer and visit a wider geographic area than do Chinese visitors,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s common for a visitor from Germany to fly into Vancouver, pick up a motor home or vehicle and travel all over the province.\u201d \u2022",

        "content": "The Province of Bohol has created a Technical Working Group (TWG) to come up with some proposed guidelines for the prevention and handling of the 2019 novel Coronavirus (nCoV) in the province.\nIn an emergency meeting recently with health agencies, Gallares and Del Valle hospitals, airport and sea port officials, with provincial health officials, agriculture and veterinary offices, Vice Governor Rene Relampagos said it was crucial to take a proactive stance in preventing the entry and spread of the virus, considering that majority of tourist arrivals in Bohol are from China.\nRelampagos underscored the importance of information and education, monitoring of reported cases, and even assessment of capabilities of agencies and offices concerned in terms of personnel and training as well as equipment in the preventive approach.\nIn a presentation by Dr. Yul Lopez, he explained that, before the discovery of the novel Coronavirus, there were six strains of the coronavirus, four of which are mild, while two are deadly, namely, SARS and MersCov.\nThe new Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in China, Hongkong, Macau, South Korea, Japan, Thailand, France, Singapore, US, Vietnam, Australia, Nepal, and Taiwan, Dr. Lopez told the attendees.\nLopez said the virus invades respiratory cells in body in order to replicate, destroying cells and disrupting functions. Human contact with animals and human to human through secretions are its mode of spreading with symptoms including common colds, cough, fever that may later on develop into pneumonia.\nThermal scanning is being conducted at the Bohol Panglao International Airport. Bureau of Quarantine Dr. Ritchie Dela Fuente assured that heightened alert has been in place since November 2019.\nBoth Gallares and Del Valle Hospitals have also set up isolation wards while timely information is expected from the surveillance activities of the Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit (RESU).\nThe Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office (PDDRMO) led by Anthony Damalerio has also offered the use of one dedicated TaRSIER117 ambulance to be manned by Gallares Hospital infectious disease health team to transport suspected patients from airport or port to isolation room of Gallares Hospital. TaRSIER 117 hotline numbers can also be utilized for communication purposes.\nThe Department of Health (DOH-7) in the region recommended to Bohol local officials to create a Provincial Incident Management Team (IMT) while the Port Management Advisory Council with shipping operators and port stakeholders under the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) was also setup to immediately convene in relation to the control of nCoV.\nRelampagos assured the public that the situation is under control and not to panic. He reiterated the advice of health authorities to exercise precaution through frequent hand washing, respiratory hygiene using masks or covering mouths when coughing and sneezing. Those experiencing symptoms are cautioned to seek immediate medical attention, he added.",

Scientists have scrambled to determine the mode of transmission, with a seafood market in Wuhan believed to be the center of the outbreak. What is this virus?\nIt\u2019s a new type of corona virus , 2019-nCoV that scientists have not seen before. Corona viruses circulate in a variety of animals, including humans. Some types can cause common colds. Others have evolved into severe illnesses like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

Because there is so much that we don\u2019t know about it.\nTransmission is said to be through droplets hence the need for hand hygiene, cough etiquette and keeping distances. But it is not certain how long the virus can survive on hard surfaces. It is not confirmed if asymptomatic persons can be infectious. It is not clear how this virus moved from animals to humans.\nAnd there is the absence of drugs to treat it as well as vaccines to protect against its infection.\nBut let\u2019s put things in proper perspective.\nFor most viruses, there are no antivirals. Treatment is only for the alleviation of symptoms to support the capacity of a patient\u2019s immune system to fight and overcome the virus.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Influenza, commonly known as the flu, infected 45 million people in the United States and killed more than 61,000 during the 2017-2018 flu season.\nBut Influenza is not an unknown pathogen. And due to the presence of vaccines and antivirals that can fight it, Influenza does not make headlines globally despite the fact that it kills thousands in the United States annually.\n2019-nCoV\u2019s current mortality rate of three percent makes it seem less deadly than Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) which had an 11% mortality rate and Mers-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) which had a 35 percent mortality rate. All three viruses, though different, all fall under the family of coronaviruses.\nThis pandemic is cause for concern. Precautions should be taken. But let us not contribute to the problem by adding panic to the equation. Let us not rush to empty our pharmacies of protective gear, leaving none left for those who need them the most\u2014the sick and those who care for the sick.\nAnd please stop believing everything you hear.

The lunar holiday in China with a lot of traveling has the potential to spread the virus so the market is awaiting to see how that turns out.

International car companies decided to withdraw their employees from their factories operating in China or banned travel to the country due to the rapid spread of the disease.\nKhaled Saad, Director General of Brilliance Bavarian and Secretary General of the Automobile Manufacturers Association, ruled out the appearance of any negative repercussions resulting from the suspension of activities in some commercial and industrial sectors in China after the outbreak of the Corona virus.\nHe pointed out that various Chinese auto companies possess stocks in Egypt that allow them to follow-up and continue their marketing activities, saying that the negative impact on the car market will appear if the virus continues to negatively affect China.\nHe added that the companies auto stocks are sufficient for the expected sales for a period of two to six months. Brilliance has enough cars for a period of three months.\nHe pointed out that the agent imports cars according to the size of local demand, not according to a monthly quota, as they are required to achieve specific annual targets determined by the parent company.\nSaad ruled out the presence of any obstacles that might hinder the entry of Chinese industrial products shipped from customs outlets, as medical checks and health security measures are carried out on agricultural products that are likely to be carriers of the virus.\nHe pointed to the intensity of the car market's competition with European and Turkish products which are exempted from customs. He also excluded the chance that Chinese companies would resort to increasing car prices in the coming period due to the inability of the local market to accommodate the rise in car prices with weak purchasing power, in addition to the fact that the rise in car prices will negatively affect sales of Chinese models which could completely stop after price increases.\nAbdel-Moneim El-Kady, vice head of the Engineering Industries Chamber of the Federation of Industries, said that feeder industries are considering the effects resulting from activity cessation in China after the Corona virus outbreak, especially since feeding industries import many raw materials from China, and auto factories are negatively affected by the possibility of stopping the supply of these raw materials.\nHe added that the factories of the feeder industries have a strategy for the quantities of raw materials, studied in advance and planned in terms of in-store units, in addition to the shipments and quantities that are opened for approval. This cycle depends on the production quantities, which are closely related to the size of the local demand.\nHe denied the fact that there are obstacles hindering the products shipped from China.\nHe pointed out that the feeder industries factories deal with companies in the industrial city of Kwangju, which is far from the city where the virus is spreading.",

Christianity is not the creed of Asia and Africa at this moment solely because the seventh century Christians of Asia and Africa had trained themselves not to fight, whereas the Moslems were trained to fight.Christianity was saved in Europe solely because the peoples of Europe fought. If the peoples of Europe in the seventh and eighth centuries, an on up to and including the seventeenth century, had not possessed a military equality with, and gradually a growing superiority over the Mohammedans who invaded Europe, Europe would at this moment be Mohammedan and the Christian religion would be exterminated. Wherever the Mohammedans have had complete sway, wherever the Christians have been unable to resist them by the sword, Christianity has ultimately disappeared. From the hammer of Charles Martel to the sword of Sobieski, Christianity owed its safety in Europe to the fact that it was able to show that it could and would fight as well as the Mohammedan aggressor. \u2026..The civilization of Europe, American and Australia exists today at all only because of the victories of civilized man over the enemies of civilization because of victories through the centuries from Charles Martel in the eighth century and those of John Sobieski in the seventeenth century. During the thousand years that included the careers of the Frankish soldier and the Polish king, the Christians of Asia and Africa proved unable to wage successful war with the Moslem conquerors; and in consequence Christianity practically vanished from the two continents; and today, nobody can find in them any \u201csocial values\u201d whatever, in the sense in which we use the words, so far as the sphere of Mohammedan influences are concerned.There are such \u201csocial values\u201d today in Europe, America and Australia only because during those thousand years, the Christians of Europe possessed the warlike power to do what the Christians of Asia and Africa had failed to do \u2014 that is, to beat back the Moslem invader. victorious with terror \" I have been made victorious with terror\" Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, \"I have been sent with the shortest expressions bearing the widest meanings, and I have been made victorious with terror (cast in the hearts of the enemy), and while I was sleeping, the keys of the treasures of the world were brought to me and put in my hand.\" Abu Huraira added: Allah's Apostle has left the world and now you, people, are bringing out those treasures (i.e. the Prophet did not benefit by them).

Vacillating between brilliant and psychotic, if you come back often enough you will find yourself wondering if this is the writing of a tortured patriotic soul or that of a demented spirit awaiting the next white room vacancy in central Florida. But what matters is that the topics make you stop and think! And after all, this is the \u201cThinking Bloggers Award.\u201d -- THE GRAY DOG RONBO The Freedom Fighter Danger To The West The biggest danger to the West is this climate of defeatism, appeasement, and cultural collapse now on display for the Islamists to see. This is the single biggest impetus to Islamist terrorism. We all have to grasp that terrorism is not the biggest threat we face. The biggest threat is the ideology that drives it. It\u2019s not enough to fight terror, vital though that is. The principal battleground is the world of ideas, the battle for hearts and minds. The Islamists see this very clearly. They understand that psychological warfare \u2014 the fomenting of paranoia, resentment, hysteria, and demoralization \u2014 is their most effective weapon. If they can hijack the human mind to the cause of hatred and lies, they have an army; and if they can bamboozle and demoralize their victims, they will win.",

The boom in searches for corona beer and the virus could therefore be self-reinforcing.\n\u201cCorona\u201d in Latin means crown, and the word is the same in Spanish. Corona beer originated in Mexico.\nIn English, the anatomical term \u201ccorona\u201d is used for body parts resembling a crown.

        "content": "CDC is closely monitoring an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel (new) coronavirus (termed \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d) that was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China and which continues to expand. Chinese health officials have reported hundreds of infections with 2019-nCoV in China, including outside of Hubei Province. Infections with 2019-nCoV also are being reported in a growing number of countries internationally, including the United States, where the first and second 2019-nCoV infections were reported on January 21 and January 24, 2020, respectively, both in travelers returning from Wuhan. Chinese health authorities were the first to post the full genome of the 2019-nCoV in GenBank , the NIH genetic sequence database, and in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data ( GISAID ) portal, an action which has facilitated detection of this virus. On January 24, 2020, CDC posted in GenBank the full genome of the 2019-nCoV virus detected in the first U.S. patient from Washington state. The virus genetic sequence from the patient in Washington is nearly identical to the sequences posted from China. The available sequences suggest a likely single, recent emergence from a virus related to bat coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. The available sequence information does not provide any information about severity of associated illness or transmissibility of the virus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing illness in people and others that circulate among animals, including camels, cats and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people and then spread between people such as has been seen with MERS and SARS . When person-to-person spread has occurred with MERS and SARS, it is thought to have happened via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread. Spread of MERS and SARS between people has generally occurred between close contacts. Past MERS and SARS outbreaks have been complex, requiring comprehensive public health responses. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, suggesting person-to-person spread is occurring. At this time, it\u2019s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people. Both MERS and SARS have been known to cause severe illness in people. The situation with regard to 2019-nCoV is still unclear. While severe illness, including illness resulting in a number of deaths has been reported in China, other patients have had milder illness and been discharged. There are ongoing investigations to learn more. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. Outbreaks of novel virus infections among people are always of public health concern. The risk from these outbreaks depends on characteristics of the virus, including whether and how well it spreads between people, the severity of resulting illness, and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccine or treatment medications). Risk Assessment Outbreaks of novel virus infections among people are always of public health concern. The risk from these outbreaks depends on characteristics of the virus, including whether and how well it spreads between people, the severity of resulting illness, and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccine or treatment medications). Investigations are ongoing to learn more, but person-to-person spread of 2019-nCoV is occurring. It\u2019s important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so. It\u2019s not clear yet how easily 2019-nCoV spreads from person-to-person. It\u2019s important to know this in order to better assess the risk posed by this virus. While CDC considers this is a very serious public health threat, based on current information, the immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV to the general American public is considered low at this time. Nevertheless, CDC is taking proactive preparedness precautions. What to Expect More cases are likely to be identified in the coming days, including more cases in the United States. Given what has occurred previously with MERS and SARS, it\u2019s likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur. CDC Response CDC is closely monitoring this situation and is working with WHO. CDC established a 2019-nCoV Incident Management Structure on January 7, 2020. On January 21, 2020, CDC activated its Emergency Response System to better provide ongoing support to the 2019-nCoV response. On January 23, 2020, CDC again raised its travel alert for the coronavirus outbreak. The travel notice for Wuhan City was raised from Level 2: Practice Enhanced Precautions to Level 3: Avoid Nonessential Travel . CDC also issued a Level 1: Practice Usual Precautions for the rest of China. CDC also is conducting entry screening of passengers on direct and connecting flights from Wuhan, China to five major airports: Atlanta (ATL), Chicago (ORD), Los Angeles, (LAX) New York city (JFK), and San Francisco (SFO). CDC issued an updated interim Health Alert Notice (HAN) Advisory to inform state and local health departments and health care providers about this outbreak on January 17, 2020. CDC teams have been deployed to support the ongoing investigation in Washington and Illinois to support the ongoing investigations of the two cases in the United States. CDC has developed a real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) test that can diagnose 2019-nCoV in respiratory and serum samples from clinical specimens. On January 24, 2020, CDC publicly posted the assay protocol for this test. Currently, testing for this virus must take place at CDC, but in the coming days and weeks, CDC will share these tests with domestic and international partners through the agency\u2019s International Reagent Resource external icon . CDC uploaded the entire genome of the virus from the first reported case in the United States to GenBank. CDC also is growing the virus in cell culture, which is necessary for further studies, including for additional genetic characterization. ",

That province has seen 5,806 cases of people with the virus so far, with 204 of those people dying from the disease, according to John Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering .\nWorldwide, 213 people have died from the diseases \u2013 all in China \u2013 and 9,776 people have been infected.\nHenry advised that people postpone trips to China, although \u201cthere is no concerns that I am aware of in transiting airports in China.\"\nShe said that while other viruses, such as measles, are far more infectious, and even the common flu kills far more people worldwide, the reason that the novel coronavirus is such a concern is that it has recently passed the species barrier and is a new virus.\nMost cases of transmission have taken place when an infected person has been symptomatic and is in very close quarters with the person who contracts the virus. There have been media reports of a case in Germany where a patient is believed to have contracted the virus from someone who was not yet showing symptoms of the disease.

Everyone has a plan till they get punched in the face.\nSo much for the Mask, Glasses and Gloves\u2026 and ubber prepper respectability. We are both sick as dogs and this has been dragging on. Just when I think its over, it keeps coming back. I am writing in between fevers.\nIn spite of our glam shots in the previous article, https://darkgreenmountainsurvivalresearchcentre.wordpress.com/2020/02/05/c5s-tales-from-the-hot-zone-24-hours-in-a-mask-sucks-literally/ it looks like we got tagged. It\u2019s probably NOT the corona virus. Then again, there is a better than average chance that it might be. Canadian Health Services has let us down in a truly head shaking way we will get to later.\nIt\u2019s hard to not to be mildly superstitious at times like these, being an apocalyptic prophet and all that. Teaching tool of The Gods.\nSeriously. What are the odds.\nIn my last article, I pointed out that though masks, gloves and glasses were a first line of defense, that it was also placebo. False sense of security. I think we have officially proven that. We might have got tagged by Asian guy coughing behind us in the line up. Sucks to be Asian at the moment. It could have been several other sick people on the assorted planes we boarded. Its a good time to be canceling traveling plans. Any place travelers pass though and congregate is a HOT ZONE on the best of days. Air Canada is also on both of our Shit Lists at the moment. I am outing them because I am a vengeful person. I\u2019ll get to that also in a bit.\nQuarantine in a well pre-stocked home is your only real defense.\nC5 Survival Quik Tip. Go to the store after reading this. Do it soon. Go pick up a few boxs of NeoCitren hot drink mix or some off brand version. You want to do it now in case there is a run on it. Don\u2019t Horde. Just get what your family needs. If you stocked up before hand, its not hording. Its proper pre planning. If you do it at this point when there is a need\u2026ITS HORDING. If you horde for resale at a heavy mark up at this point, I got no problem with someone waking you up in the middle night by pouring gasoline on you and lighting a smoke. I mentioned I am a vicious fellow.\nWe had some on hand because we have pre planned medical supplies\u2026 and we buy on sale.\nAnd this is where I get to tell you that we suck at times and are not the ultimate preppers\u2026 and the teaching tool of the gods. I was shocked to find out we only had two boxes. There might or might not be another kicking around as we are not super organized. The problem is that we had used it up in previous illnesses, hadn\u2019t restocked\u2026 and hadn\u2019t noticed. Ild head there now if I could summon the strength. I cant. COUGH!\nNight Time NeoCytren is the important one because you want to sleep as much as you can. The Day Time version is also important if you absolutely must get up and need the kick to not die or care for others.\nAnd a prepper related issue others dont think about. When I saw I was hit and before I got too week to move, My final act was to move the car down the hill to the road and walk back up before collapsing. Good thing I did. Somewhere in between then, delirium and now, we were snowed in. Also, I was having trouble keeping the wood fire fed. As well as the animals. Luckily we have no shortage of food on hand. Too bad I have no apatite to eat it. We have been able to eat ice cream. Canned chicken soup at the start\u2026 but not now. We force down what we can when the Ibbeprophen kicks in.\nAnd now for the Rapidly Changing News. You should be checking MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY. Things Keep Changing. Info keeps changing.\nLets start here. I\u2019m cutting Canadian Prepper some slack today. We are not always on the same page. As preppers go, he is a semi respectable prepper. No need to challenge him today as I would lose in a fight with a toddler. COUGH\nThe person he is referencing is this guy.\nAnd he is pointing out a lot about what Chris Martenson was sounding the alarm about. This is already old news by several days\u2026 but in case you missed it, it looks like it may have jumped to airborne. Not good.\nHe keeps being proven right\u2026 but he gets a double tap. Perhaps you missed this story. He came under attack by the WTO and media. In fact, if you go to the YouTube page The WTO forced in a link to his page. Now who would want to pick on nice guy, Chris. M. He must have hit a nerve.\nSoooo\u2026..Here is our own story of stupid\u2026 and why the numbers dont tell the whole story.\nMrsC5 got sick before me by a couple of days. Probably spread it to me. Because we had been to a world nexus\u2026 and a lot of Chinese got out before the lock down, MrsC5 Good Samaritaned it and called the Nova Scotia health hotline to talk with a Nurse Practitioner. After the story and symptoms, The NP said, \u201cI want you to go to the Emergency and get a swab done right now. Did you hear and understand me. Don\u2019t wait till later. Don\u2019t think about it. Go now.\u201d\nI was just getting muscle achy at that point so I drove. She went through the highly painful experience of having three plus inches of swab jammed down here navel cavity. 3 times.\nThere is a nasal triple penetration joke in there somewhere\u2026 but I\u2019m getting nothing.\nAfter the weekend was over, we called back for the results. When they finally got back to us, we were informed they didn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t be sending it for testing. That they were only doing tests if we had been to Wuhan. Now, that\u2019s Tax money well spent. Plus we potentially infected our local Hospital and a small town filled with old people. Look, Its most likely a Central American flu and it just hitting us hard because we haven\u2019t been hit by those before.\nBut We\u2019ll Never Know. You will never know. The local doctors will know too late\u2026 and most importantly, if we did get it, the Government approved statistics will never know. Take that as you will.\nThe Official death toll is over 1100 at the time of writing.\nBut just a thought to keep you focused on the bigger picture. While 1100+ people just died\u2026. At the time of writing, since the beginning of the year, the world population has increased by 9 and a half million budding new consumers. What did you think was going to happen.\nIts good to just stare at this occasionally, to keep you suitably frightened\u2026 and think though some of the \u201cSolutions\u201d the Right demand to obscure action and the Left naively throw out placating themselves from action. We are riding this train all the way, baby.\nhttps://www.worldometers.info/world-population/\nWell, lets continue my roll as the bad boy of the prepper world. I notice a random comment on The Dinner in reference to Carolyn Baker, Richard Hienberg and others. Nearingsfault, a prepper I actually respect commented\u2026.\n\u201cNot my scene. Lots of really cozy well fed well read people very in touch with their feelings. Give me a good foul mouthed skinned knuckle dooer like C5 anyday\u2026\u201d\nCam, a newly collapse aware young person that I will write an article for all to read, responded,\u2026\n\u201d I love C5\u2019s writing. He doesn\u2019t beat around the bush and he\u2019s pretty funny too. \u201d\nI think I have got an appropriate song to go along with the subject\u2026 and bush beating. Shall I tell them about the R- Rated part, other C5. I think Not. Oh, you will know the exact moment I burst out laughing myself. Ah, My peeps.\nWell, its time to Kick Ass, Take Names\u2026 and hopefully lower a heartless and irresponsible corporations stock price.\nDid I mention yet that I have a vindictive side.\nAir Canada. You\u2019ve Made My Shit List.\nHopefully you caught the subtle transition from L7s other well known song. Never mind.\nA close friend of MrsC5 had died and she had booked a cheap flight on Air Canada. Then all this happened. MrsC5 called to find out if if things could be changed or rebooked. There should be some bending over backwards to accommodate wold events. She was informed they didn\u2019t care and we had just lost the 700$.\nHere is the part to pay attention to. MrsC5 then said she was going to take the flight anyhow. She was delirious with fever at the time.\nAir Canada didn\u2019t care and would of let her on the plane anyhow. Your safety is not their business.\nMrsC5 couldn\u2019t stay upright so she missed the plane. She could have been in the sky as I write. Now, Think about that. How many people the world over cant afford to throw away 700$ and would get on that plane anyhow because they had no option. A lot.\nSo, I wouldn\u2019t get on a Plane any time soon. Air Canada, FUCK YOU.\nAs Bruce Lee Used to say, \u201cAlways Bet On The Street\u201d\nOne last thing before I go. There IS a lot of conspiracy theories that have popped up from the usual Black Helicopter, New World Order trying to take our guns, Alien Anal Probe, The LEFT wants to turn our children gay, Chemtrail and Agenda 21, vocal retard crowd.\nNow I\u2019m just curious. I\u2019m going to start a conspiracy theory right here and now\u2026 just to see if it takes off and how fast. Let me state now, I dont think this. I\u2019m Making it up.\nDonald Trump released the weaponized Corona Virus to help with the Trade WAR. His intent was to MAKE AMERICA THE LAST COUNTRY STANDING AGAIN. This was to distract from his impeachment\u2026 and even if he had been impeached, he would have succeeded in his long term goal of genocide. This would also improve his re election campaign, playing to his anti China, anti immigrant base, while increasing surveillance spending and setting up a permanent emergency to suspend elections.\nHere is the proof, Donald Trump was in China for Trade Talks November 8-10 with a mixed entourage of government agents and his Mob Tied Lawyers. This was how it was snuck into the country. It was passed to US funded dissidents, taken away from the scene of the crime and released in its intended location, Tuesday, December 31. The location was near a Chinese Bio Weapons base, in a double reverse blame shift.\nThen an insider let it slip as he bragged in public, now knowing Trump was untouchable from legal challenge or accountability. Trump Insider and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, bagged about the plot and how this would help American companies and punish those that used China\u2019s supply chain. Follow the money. Then they fired pentagon whistle blowers that weren\u2019t loyal in case the plot got to them. In Hubris, Trump thought it could be contained in China so he praised China\u2019s draconian measures and has stayed quiet about its police state.\nNow I don,t believe a word of this but like any good con, its based on using a lot of true facts, carefully arranged to to tell a plausible story . It would have more power if I claimed it over and over and say it either through manufactured outrage or putting it out as secret insider knowledge revield. This is what the government doesn\u2019t want you to know. It works best on populations that are struggling and want to know the secret truth of why.\nWhy am I telling you this? High Paid Right Wing Think Tanks and political operatives make this shit up every day. Then it is sent out by an army of trolls and an even bigger army of bots. Its called Gas Lighting and its intention is to get people to doubt there own experience. Its a form of control.\nAnd you are exposed to that every day. Heck. I pulled that story line together wile feverish. Just think what I could accomplish with malicious intent.\nI\u2019m also pointing this out because preppers, gun folk and the religious are particular targets to this type of manipulation. I\u2019m just doing my part to help you understand how this works and hopefully you can start to see behind the curtain.\nI\u2019m feeling much better since starting this, this morning. Hopefully I have built some new immunity. MrsC5 is still down and struggling\u2026 and she started a couple days before me.\nRecommended reading would be chapter 1 and 2 of, once again, World War Z. The book. Not the movie. Ah, Cum On. We all knew the Zombie Apocalypse would start in China.\nA little light watching if you are trapped in doors.\nThis is Category5 Transmitting from the Dark Green Mountain. If you are receiving this Broadcast, YOU are The Rebel Alliance\n\nDont forget the Tip Jar at the top of the page. Daddy needs to replenish his NeoCitren Night Time when I\u2019m sure I\u2019m no longer contagious.\nOh Ya. Don\u2019t forget to pick up extra cash\u2026 just in case the banks decide to close\u2026 for some mysterious reason. Might I recommend 5$ bills and ones. That way, if they go to hand you back change, you can tell them to keep it. Money. Big Disease vector.\nLast time I used my credit card, I used a disposable wood stir stick to punch in the code. Who know where those fingers have been. Dont be shy. You Know\u2026 from, uhm\u2026First Hand Experience.\nI think I will go re watch the movie Contagion again.

But that\u2019s not stopping people from searching Google to apparently try to double check.\nGoogle Trends released data showing that around late January, there was a marked spike in searches for the terms \u201cbeer virus\u201d and \u201ccorona beer virus.\u201d\nJan. 25 showed the height of the spike in searches for the term \u201cbeer virus,\u201d as searches rose to a value of 100 on Google Trends indicating a peak in popularity. For the term \u201ccorona beer virus,\u201d it peaked at a value of 81, so searches for that term hit the top of the spike on Jan. 25, but the term was searched a little less often.\nConnecticut, Oregon and New York searched the term \u201ccorona beer virus\u201d the most. Meanwhile, New Mexico, Nebraska and Kansas were in the top three for opting to keep it simple and search \u201cbeer virus\u201d the most out of the two choices. Google Trends\nWorldwide those search terms both hit their peak on Jan. 25 as well according to Google Trends. Searches for the term \u201cbeer virus\u201d were highest in the countries of Serbia, Austria and Ireland, Google reported. Searches for the longer \u201ccorona beer virus\u201d were highest in South Africa, Portugal and the Netherlands. Google Trends\nThe Miami Herald points out that it might be Google itself leading to the mix up. The search term \u201ccorona beer virus\u201d has popped up as the second option in the search engine\u2019s predictive search feature when \u201ccorona\u201d was typed into the search field, pointing to a possible cause of confusion.\nWednesday a plane plane chartered by the U.S. government evacuated 201 Americans out of the Chinese city that is at the center of the coronavirus outbreak. The plane arrived at a Southern California military base after everyone on board passed a health screening, the Associated Press reported .\nThe plane was chartered to carry out diplomats from the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan.\nAll of the passengers had also been through two health screenings before leaving China and were screened two additional times by the CDC as they transited through their first U.S. stop in Anchorage, Alaska.\nAs of Wednesday, the Associated Press reported that the number of confirmed cases of 2019 Novel Coronavirus ( 2019-nCoV ) had climbed to 5,974, surpassing the 5,327 number of people sickened during the SARS outbreak in mainland China from 2002-2003.",

The communist regime stands in peril this afternoon, helplessly, as the Corona Virus holds its economy hostage. Factories are closed, which interrupts the supply chain for the American companies which provide the trade surplus that finances the totalitarian state. Companies already seeking alternatives (thanks to President Donald John Trump's tariffs) are looking harder today for more reliable sources.\nNothing personal, just business. Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola got that right.\nThe Associated Press reported , \"China remained mostly closed for business Tuesday, as the daily death toll from a new virus topped 100 for the first time, pushing the total above 1,000.\n\"Despite the official end of the extended Lunar New Year holiday, many remained at home on Tuesday with around 60 million people under virtual quarantine.\n\"Authorities in Hong Kong evacuated people from an apartment block where four were found to be infected, raising fears the virus may be spreading through plumbing, similar to what happened in 2003\u2032s deadly SARS outbreak.\"\nThe flu shut down factories and Xi is reeling. Bloomberg News reported , \"China\u2019s efforts to contain the Corona Virus are rippling far beyond Hubei province, the epicenter of the disease. At 4.6 trillion yuan ($660 billion) in 2019, Hubei\u2019s economy is bigger than Poland\u2019s or Sweden\u2019s and accounts for 4.6% of China\u2019s national gross domestic product.\"\nTariffs compound the problem.\nBloomberg News reported, \"For factories in China that make lower-end goods such as furniture and cheap phones, the Corona Virus is the latest in a series of existential threats. Already operating on paper-thin margins because of rising labor and materials costs, these businesses sustained another blow from the tariffs the Trump administration levied on $360 billion worth of Chinese exports to the U.S.\"\nThe Chi-Comm economy is motionless. Xi's secretary general of the National Development and Reform Commission, told reporters, \"Without the reopening of businesses, in the short term, it will affect the supply of medical material and ... in the long run, it will affect the supply of all kinds of production and life materials and will make the control and prevention efforts on the front line unsustainable. The target of defeating the epidemic will not be reached.\"\nPresident Donald John Trump pounced.\nThe Associated Press reported, \"Among a growing number of travel restrictions, the U.S. said that, as of Monday, it had suspended regular visa services at the embassy in Beijing and consulates general in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenyang. The Consulate General in Wuhan has already been closed and its staff evacuated.\n\"A presidential proclamation issued Feb. 2 banned entry to the U.S. to foreigners or non-permanent residents who had been in China fewer than 14 days prior to their arrival. Exceptions were made for foreign diplomats, flight crew and family members of U.S. citizens or permanent residents.\"\nWorried communist sympathizers in our country are calling this xenophobic.\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg News also reported, \"Bloomberg Economics estimates that if the outbreak is successfully contained, the impact on China\u2019s economy will be severe but short-lived -- with growth slowing to 4.5% in the first quarter, followed by a recovery and then stabilization in the second half. That trajectory would put full-year growth in 2020 at 5.7%, which is 0.2 percentage point below Bloomberg Economics\u2019 forecast prior to the outbreak and down from 6.1% in 2019. If it takes longer to come under control, the hit to growth would be bigger.\"\nDavid Ni is the chief executive of Jiangsu Siborui Import and Export Co. headquartered in the Yangtze port city of Nanjin. The company buys aluminum alloy wheels for cars from Chinese producers and exports them to retail outlets in the U.S.\nHe told Bloomberg News, \"We are missing our peak sales season.\" He also said, \"There\u2019s little factory owners can do except wait. On and off, the epidemic could delay production for at least two months. Most factories this year wouldn\u2019t be able to make any money.\"\nThe story said, \"None of its suppliers have gone back to work yet, and it\u2019s unclear when they will, says Ni, who\u2019s based in Los Angeles.\"\nAnd Red China has another flu-related problem. CNBC reported , \"Mongolia has suspended deliveries of coal across its southern border into China until March 2, Reuters reported Monday, citing the country\u2019s National Emergency Commission.\n\"The move is designed to prevent the spread of the Corona Virus, with the commission also recommending the country suspend its Tsagaan Sar Lunar New Year celebrations later this month. Mongolia has not yet reported any cases of the Corona Virus.\"\nAnd of course, Red China's tourism industry is dead for now, and will likely have a slow recovery. The cruise industry worldwide also will suffer a hit.\nRed China's foreign customers may be the least of Xi's worries. The Wall Street Journal reported, \"The Chinese leader also faces anger and frustration over the government\u2019s response to the outbreak, emotions that swelled Friday with the death from the virus of Li Wenliang, a young doctor punished for trying to raise an early alarm.\n\"In the province of Hubei, the center of the outbreak, hospitals are overwhelmed, medical and food supplies depleted, and some 60 million people are held under the largest quarantine in history. The virus first emerged in December in the industrial city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei.\n\"While much of the nation\u2019s anger is directed at local authorities, blamed for trying to cover up the outbreak, many people also are channeling fury at the censorship and rigid, centralized authority that Mr. Xi has galvanized over the past seven years.\"\nPart of the problem is the public does not trust the media, which means it does not trust the regime. This spoils communication.\nGlenn Reynolds wrote , \"Well, perhaps the Chinese officials are lying, but perhaps they\u2019re telling the truth, at least to the best of their ability. But while the Chinese government undoubtedly knows more than the rest of us about the scope of the problem, it probably knows a lot less than it would like to about what is going on. People are often afraid to report bad news, because the government has a history of punishing those who do.\n\"Police in Yunnan province punished medical workers for sharing information about what was going on in their areas. And, of course, Li Wenliang, the doctor who first spoke out about the need for urgent action and shared his observations with medical associates, was formally reprimanded for rumor-mongering, likely resulting in a delay of weeks before the problem was taken seriously. Li died last week at the age of 34, apparently after he contracted it from a patient.\"\nPeons will put up with a lot from their government. A flu epidemic, though, is not on that list of things the serfs suffer in silence.",

        "content": "Time for homeopaths to join fight against corona Virus to show that Nosodes works\nDr K K Aggarwal President Heart Care Foundation of India\nIt\u2019s the time for the homeopaths all over the world to join fight against corona virus and show that the concept of nosode works.\nModern Medicine use vaccines for prevention and they have none for the current corona virus. A \u201cVaccine\u201d is any substance used in active immunization. \u201cActive immunization\u201d is the inoculation, usually by injection of a special antigen to promote antibody production. These may be dead bacteria (e.g. Typhoid), dead viruses (e.g. Salk polio), live viruses (e.g. Sabin\u2019s polio), or toxoids (e.g. Tetanus or Diphtheria).\nHomoeopathy had its own theory regarding vaccination. It never introduces pathogenic microorganisms into the body, so its medicine cannot strictly be called vaccines. The equivalent are Nosodes, which have a prophylactic or preventative effect. They are always taken orally. These Nosodes are prepared by a process of diluting and succession, called potentization, so that there is no trace of the original pathogen remaining.\nA nosode (from nosos, the Greek word meaning disease) is a homeopathic preparation made from matter from a sick animal or person. Substances such as respiratory discharges or diseased tissues are used. The preparation, using alcohol, as well as the repeated dilution and succession, essentially renders the substances harmless, while producing a powerful remedy.\nHomeopathy is a science where the matter is converted into nonmatter before it is used in the clinical practice.\nDuring the 200-year history of Homoeopathy, this form of medicine has proved to be extraordinarily effective in preventing and curing epidemic disease. Dr Samuel Hahnemann had great success in treating epidemics of scarlet fever. Villages treated with his prophylactics entirely escaped dreaded epidemics, including the Plague.\n\"The Journal of the American Institute for Homeopathy, May 1921, had a long article about the use of homeopathy in the flu epidemic. Dr. T A McCann, from Dayton, Ohio reported that 24,000 cases of flu treated allopathically had a mortality rate of 28.2% while 26,000 cases of flu treated homeopathically had a mortality rate of 1.05%.\nThis last figure was supported by Dean W.A. Pearson of Philadelphia (Hahnemann College) who collected 26,795 cases of flu treated with homeopathy with the above result. Dr. Herbert A. Roberts from Derby, CT, said that 30 physicians in Connecticut responded to his request for data. They reported 6,602 cases with 55 deaths, which is less than 1%. Dr. Roberts was working as a physician on a troop ship during WWI. He had 81 cases of flu on the way over to Europe. He reported, \"All recovered and were landed. Every man received homeopathic treatment. One ship lost 31 on the way.\"--- Julian Winston\nNosodes have been used in prophylaxis. Examples would be the use of Influenzinum in flu prophylaxis or Morbillinum in a measles epidemic. Closely related to this would be the use of the sarcode Anas barbare hepatis et cardus extractum (liver and heart of the Barbary duck) for 'flu. Derived from tissues of the native host of influenza, this remedy is prepared from tissue containing and reacting to the influenza virus.\nFor preparing Nosodes specific perpetrations are used in the prevention of corresponding diseases. e.g. - Morbillinum - Measles, Variolinum - Smallpox, Influenzinum - Influenza, Diphtherinum - Diphtheria\nDr. H.C. Allen notes about the use of Diphtherinum, \"The author has used it for twenty-five years as a prophylactic and has never known a second case of diphtheria to occur in a family after it had been administered\".\nHomeopathic preparations have not been shown to raise antibody levels. Smits tested the titer of antibodies to diphtheria, polio and tetanus in ten children before and one month after giving homeopathic preparations of these three vaccines (DTPol 30K and 200K). He found no rise in antibody levels (Smits, 1995). He speculates that protection afforded by a homeopathic remedy acts on a \"deeper\" level than that of antibodies.\nHomoeopathic remedies reduce the patient's sensitivity to the dynamic stimulus of the virus or bacteria, thus lessening the patient's predisposition to being overcome by this stimulus\" (Golden, 1994).\nIf homeopathic remedies do not produce an increase in antibody levels, then the only way to measure the effectiveness of homeopathic prophylaxis is through clinical results.\nIn modern medicine a similar concept has been used in making a lung cancer nosode equivalent by repeatedly radiating the lung cancer tissue. I personally has seen many anecdote cases that nosode works.",

They also promoted it through an Instagram post that featured a graphic of a man in a cartoon rice hat holding a beer with a face mask covering his mouth.\nAnthony Leong, president of the Chinese-Australia Friendship Association, called the event \u201cignorant, racist and insensitive,\u201d before it was canceled, which led to Mr. Chan\u2019s and Pawn & Co issuing apologies, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\u201cWe recognize that a promotional post that was made last week was offensive and we unreservedly apologize for this,\u201d Mr. Chan\u2019s said, according to the newspaper.\nPawn & Co also apologized, but seemed to distance itself from Mr. Chan\u2019s.\n\u201cFrom the team at Pawn & Co, we would like to unreservedly apologize for the insensitive and inappropriate marketing that has been circulated from Mr Chan\u2019s,\u201d the statement said, according to both outlets. \u201cWhilst it is an external promotional company that owns the Mr Chan\u2019s brand, we acknowledge that we should have been more active in understanding the communication being marketed and how it might be perceived.\u201d\nMr. Chan\u2019s and Pawn & Co have deleted their Instagram and Facebook accounts.\nAs of Wednesday, there have been 24,324 cases of coronavirus in China, and 490 people have died from the respiratory illness.

Disturbing but true.\nClose your eyes. Imagine a world where disease-carrying pathogens are considered \u201cinventions.\u201d Now open your eyes. You live in that world!\nThe U.S. Patent Office indicates that Corona virus is Patent No. US10130701B2 (Nov. 20, 2018). Click on the below link \u2014 and see for yourself \u2014 Corona Patent \u2013> https://patents.google.com/patent/US10130701/en\nWaves of Corona outbreaks are coming soon! But there\u2019s good news \u2014 the Corona vaccine will soon be available at CVS, Rite-Aid and Walgreens! Just in the nick of time!\nSo, what\u2019s a Corona virus? It\u2019s a virus that reportedly causes runny nose, coughing, sore throat, and sometimes a fever . According to WebMD: \u201cIn most cases, you won\u2019t know whether you have a coronavirus or a different cold-causing virus.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s just the common cold.\nBut common cold outbreaks are not scary enough to prompt lawmakers to enact new vaccine mandates. So they crank-up the fear factor with horror movie headlines and apocalyptic images of sinister undertakers dressed in creepy-looking HAZ-MAT outfits!\nAnd when the Corona virus strikes, gov\u2019t authorities will refuse to examine it under a microscope. If they ever do, they\u2019ll immediately recognize the patented LAB strain of the virus \u2014 in every confirmed case \u2014 and it will then be revealed that the LAB strain caused the outbreak!\nYes, folks are being infected with the LAB strain of the virus. But if this fact ever leaks-out, the Corona Caper will unravel. So the authorities LIE to us. They claim the outbreaks are caused by elusive, WILD strains of the virus. But remember, Corona virus is an \u201cinvention.\u201d There is no WILD strain of the virus!\nThe mainstream media have already begun their Corona disinformation campaign. Gov\u2019t lapdogs at USA Today report on what they call \u201cbogus theories\u201d that the Corona virus is patented. Um, okay, \u2014 but it * is * patented. Not a \u201ctheory!\u201d It\u2019s a \u201cfactoid\u201d capable of verification at the U.S. Patent Office.\nAccording to USA Today , the Corona patent is just a social media myth. But USA Today is a fake news peddler! They get paid to run \u201cads\u201d alongside their news stories. And the more ad revenue they receive, the more fake their stories become. Fake News from USA Today \u2013> https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/01/25/wuhan-coronavirus-bogus-conspiracy-theory-spreads-social-media/4569180002/ Despite the disinformation, the Corona virus is indeed patented \u2014 which makes it readily identifiable and distinct from WILD strains. The gov\u2019t clearly has the means to discern whether victims are catching the LAB strain or a WILD strain, but the gov\u2019t just doesn\u2019t care to investigate. They already know which strain sparked the outbreak! After all, it was the gov\u2019t that awarded the patent in the first place! (Wink-wink!)\nWhen Corona outbreaks visit your town (and they will) tell your local health inspectors that Corona \u201ctest kits\u201d yield only positive or negative test results, i.e ., they never reveal the actual viral strain.\nWhen they announce Corona outbreaks, insist that officials examine blood samples under a microscope \u2014 to determine whether the outbreak involves the LAB strain or a WILD strain.\nHey! There\u2019s a Quest Diagnostics lab on every street corner in America! There\u2019s no reason to avoid scrutinizing the Corona virus under a microscope! But mainstream science has no wish to study, research, or gain understanding about the origins of infectious outbreaks or how they spread. Mainstream science is too busy creating fear and panic \u2014 to sell more vaccines.\nOnce you see the fraud in how they \u201cconfirm\u201d the identity of the virus that supposedly caused the outbreak, you suddenly see the fraud in the outbreak itself. All outbreak hoaxes unravel once you realize that \u201cconfirmed\u201d cases of the dreaded disease are never actually \u201cconfirmed\u201d under a microscope.\nConsider this \u2014 many scientists are employed as \u201cvirus hunters.\u201d Their only job is to search for new viruses. If they find one \u2014 they quickly bring it into captivity \u2014 to patent it! Capitalism has a way of turning nature into commodities! And yet, whenever there\u2019s an infectious outbreak, presumably caused by new, WILD viruses, nobody ever goes hunting for these new, WILD viruses! (Get it?)\nPredictably, the unvaccinated will be blamed for the Corona outbreaks. Kristen Bell will blame the heathen parents of unclean, ungodly, and unvaccinated children who aren\u2019t caught-up on their Corona boosters, right?! But wait a sec\u2019\u2014 how can Sarah Marshall blame the unvaccinated for Corona outbreaks \u2014 when all Americans are unvaccinated for Coronal Disease? (\u201cShh!\u201d Don\u2019t ask!)\nIf they ever examined, under a microscope, blood samples from Corona victims, they\u2019d plainly see that all were infected with the LAB strain of the virus! And they cleverly conceal this fact with test kits that test only for exposure to the virus \u2014 and which never identify the culprit viral strain! (Are you paying attention?)\nGuess what? Ebola virus is patented. AIDS virus is patented. Measles virus is patented. And so is Chickenpox virus, Zika virus, SARS virus, MRSA virus, Avian flu virus, etc . Any virus you can name \u2014 it\u2019s patented. All viruses now in captivity are patented.\nAnd all Corona outbreaks are staged media events! For goodness\u2019 sake \u2014 no Corona outbreaks exist in the historical record!\nRemember when your mom told you how to care for diseases like Mumps, Measles and Coronas? Remember that time you stayed home from school for a week with a bad case of the Coronas? NO! Because the Corona virus never existed until Bill Gates paid some slob to invent it \u2014 so they can have more outbreaks \u2014 so they can sell more vaccines \u2014 so they can kill-off more useless eaters \u2014 so they can roll-out their new world order! \u201cIf we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, and reproductive health services, we could lower world population by 10 or 15 percent.\u201d\u2013 Bill Gates\nYou guessed it! Bill Gates owns the patented Corona virus! And, not surprisingly, Bill Gates also own the rights to the anti-Corona virus vaccine!\nThe recent Corona outbreaks, which follow closely on the heels of the patent approval, is another c-o-n-s-p-i-r-a-c-y . (There! I said it!) But this should be evident from the intensive media coverage, which is calculated to scare you half to death! Be afraid! Be very afraid! Fear sells vaccines!\nCorona outbreaks will scare lawmakers into enacting Corona vaccine mandates! Next thing ya know, they will patent a Heineken virus! So expect Heineken outbreaks \u2014 and then Heineken vaccines! This is how they do the masses. This is how the vaccine holocaust begins! This is what genocide looks like!\nThis is how they plan to exterminate seven billion useless eaters. There\u2019s no need for gas chambers when vaccines will do the job nice and neat \u2014 and nobody will even know it\u2019s a holocaust.\nThe downward spiral comes quickly \u2014 the time to resist is now. Just remember, it\u2019s easier to genocide a population \u2014 than to convince them they\u2019re being genocided. You heard me.",

The name stands for the coronavirus disease that was discovered on the 31st December, 2019.\nTo date, there remains no suspected, reported or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in The Bahamas. Currently, there are more than forty-four thousand (44,000) cases confirmed on Mainland China, with at least one thousand (1000) deaths with spread to at least twenty-seven (27) countries.\nThe Ministry of Health can advise that update meetings were held with operational stakeholders regarding the implementation of the COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan (CPRP).\nThe number of persons arriving at Bahamian ports for processing and screening for quarantine measures has declined. Currently, four (4) persons have been released from quarantine, and another two (2) persons are expected to be released today. The individuals that were monitored and those presently being monitored have shown no symptoms of the virus. Quarantine measures remain set at fourteen (14) days.\nRepresentatives from the Ministry of Health will be visiting Grand Bahama tomorrow to meet with relevant stakeholder groups on that island. The Ministry of Health will continue to monitor the development of COVID-19, and provide ongoing updates to the public.\nOriginal Article: (Published on February 8th, 2020)\nThe Ministry of Health wishes to advise the public that there remains no suspected, reported or confirmed cases of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in The Bahamas. Currently, the 2019-nCoV has spread to at least twenty-seven (27) countries, and now has more than twenty eight thousand (28,000) cases confirmed on Mainland China, with five hundred sixty-five (565) deaths.\nTo date, fifteen (15) residents have been quarantined. The individuals monitored currently have not experienced symptoms of the virus.\nThe Ministry of Health also wishes to advise that the Novel Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Plan (NCPRP) was distributed to all relevant stakeholders. Subsequently, several meetings have been convened to familiarize stakeholders with the plan.\nOn 5th February, 2020, the Novel Coronavirus Operations Committee met and reviewed the step-by-step approach with customs and immigration officers and healthcare providers stationed at the Lynden Pindling International Airport and other ports of entry. Meetings were also held with unions, including doctors, nurses, customs and immigration unions, to discuss union members\u2019 concerns regarding 2019-nCoV and how persons can protect themselves.\nThursday, 6th February, 2020, a meeting was conducted with health care providers from public and private sectors inclusive of doctors, nurses, allied health workers and support staff to discuss the importance of health facility plans, and emphasize isolation procedures and other protocols. The Minister of Health chaired a follow-up meeting to update government agencies on current activities associated with 2019-nCoV, resolve reported loopholes and encourage smooth and effective communication.\nThe Ministry of Health also engaged the Bahamas Hotel Association to ensure that frontline staff of our tourism industry are informed and provided with the steps to be taken in the event a person presenting has traveled to Mainland China in the past 20 days.\nThe Pinewood Constituency Association in conjunction with the Ministry of Health participated in a Town Hall Meeting on the 6th February, 2020, at the Cleveland Eneas Primary School in Pinewood Gardens to discuss the topic: \u201cWhat You Need to Know About the Novel Coronavirus.\u201d\nThe Ministry of Health will continue to monitor the development of the 2019-nCoV, and provide ongoing updates to the public.",

        "content": "We should not panic \u2013 but we should be prepared. Following the SARS crisis, researchers showed that domestic cats could catch acute respiratory syndrome and transmit it to other cats, as well as gulls. The cats who lived in a Hong Kong apartment block were found with an unusual number of SARS patients infected with the virus. Dogs associated with Ebola infected health care workers were destroyed or quarantined in Spain and the United States because officials were concerned about transmissible.\nAnd the novel coronavirus, \u201cWe have no idea if there is any danger, but we have to assume that there is some until we prove the contrary,\u201d said Weese to the Star last week after talking about animals and on infectious diseases by Ontario Veterinary Medical Association conference in Toronto. \u201cIf we are saying that your husband must quarantine, we should do the same with your dog and cat.\u201d\nIt would be preferable that we now see a few animals inside and find out later that these measures were not unnecessary and did not cause them any disruption and that they later got a role in their transmission.\n\u201cThat said, it is more difficult to quench a dog then, in certain ways,\u201d he says. Dogs must bounce, and UberEats cats can not be ordered.\nIf a coronary virus patient could no longer care for their pets, it will certainly come here, to Ontario Veterinary College Health Sciences Center, Canada\u2019s largest animal hospital and a facility equipped with high-level isolated units.\nScott Weese, an infectious animal disease researcher, and Marlowe Schott, an infection control practitioner, wear protective equipment as he goes through a practice process to admit a dog to the integrated animal hospital facilities at the University of Guelph on Friday. Peter Power / Don Toronto Star\nWeese researchers\u2019 attention arises from urgent truth: when it comes to infectious diseases, the barrier between people and all other animals is very permeable.\nBats are likely to have originated in Chinese horseshoe bats and jumped to palm civets, a wild mammal being sold at a live animal market in Guangdong province of China, before entering the market. The best blow to researchers at present is the novel source of coronary viruses than bats, and then it is likely that there will be an intermediary mammal before making the jump to humans. On Friday, Chinese researchers published preliminary findings \u2013 many scientists were not in dispute \u2013 suggesting that the animal is a coronavirus of the pangolin, a protected mammal that is illegally trafficked nevertheless.\nOver 70 per cent of new infectious diseases come from animals, according to estimates. Ebola, anthrax, swine flu, avian influenza and Middle East respiratory syndrome have an animal base.\nBut the transmission can go away \u2013 which is also a problem for people. If we have an infectious disease but continue to spread in animals, these animals act as a \u201creservoir\u201d for disease and risk that triggers a new outbreak. Pets can also be an infectious risk because we are in contact with them a lot: it is difficult to disinfect fur.\nDuring the SARS crisis in 2003, over 8,000 people around the world and killed nearly 800, including 44 in Canada, made Weese try to flag pets as a concern. He discovered a significant microbiologist during the crisis and raised the possibility of transmitting human-by-animals.\n\u201cThe kind of response was,\u2018 Yeah, it\u2019s interesting, go. \u201dYou are in the middle of a big chaos, and this is an issue \u2013 dealing with all the human things is a priority.\u201d\nPublic health officers rely on \u201ccontact tracking\u201d when attempting to limit the spread of infectious diseases: identify and follow up anyone who may come into contact with an ill person. In Toronto in 2003, over 23,000 people were quarantined for contact with a SARS or suspected case.\n\u201cTraditionally this means human contacts,\u201d says Weese. \u201cIn me, contacts mean anything that has a pulse.\u201d\nThe Irish people knew that the spread of SARS could be catastrophic if the virus got into the Toronto population of stray cats.\nSARS revealed dangerous gaps in Toronto\u2019s healthcare system, some of which were above: hospital infection prevention and control teams contributed to staff, local public health agencies expanded, and rapid communication systems were developed.\nFor human health, \u201cthe response to this was much better than SARS because all preparedness was there. The response on the side of the animal is not as nice as I would like it to be, \u201dbut it is better, thanks in part to the work done following the high profile Ebola scare.\nScott Weese, right director of the Center for Public Health and Zoonoses at the University of Guelph, and Marlowe Schott, an infection control practitioner, are looking at ways in which a pet with the coronary virus can infect people. The quota points out that there are no concerns that cats and dogs will spread the virus in Ontario. Peter Power / Don Toronto Star\nNothing aggravating the mind as a hemorrhagic fever outbreak is very contagious: For a few months late in 2014, the public was suddenly and deeply invested in whether pets could catch infectious diseases.\nThe terrible Ebola outbreak grew in West Africa, which would eventually kill more than 11,000 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. In October of that year, Spanish nurse Ebola seized a patient from the region.\nDespite objections, the Spanish health authorities destroyed the nurse\u2019s dog, fearing that they would be transmitted. The evidence to support these fears is limited: one study found that dogs living near an outbreak site had Ebola antibodies, suggesting that there was some infection.\nLater that same month, a Texas nurse was diagnosed with Ebola. Her dog, Bentley, was quarantined, getting support for the dog \u2013 president Barack Obama inquired about Bentley after the nurse was released from hospital.\nSubsequently, Weese and a number of co-authors developed a comprehensive guidance document on what would happen in Ontario if a dog were exposed to Ebola.\nWith Merlin acting as the exposed animal, Weese and a colleague, including Merlin, had a thorough long-time simulation taking place, to recover, transport and isolate, to discourage all potential incidents. (For cats, they wore Kevlar gloves scratch resistant.) They covered themselves in a pouch of pads and chocolate sauce before their protective equipment was destroyed: their bodies or clothes were stained after disinfecting evidence of corruption. \u201cEbola\u201d.\n\u201cWhen we wrote the Ebola (guidelines), we realized that they probably wouldn\u2019t use it, but we might use it for something else,\u201d said Weese. The current coronavirus outbreak is the type of sample.\nThe tooths emphasize again and again that there is no concern that cats and dogs will spread corona virus in Ontario. As he recently wrote on his blog \u201cWorms and Germs\u201d, \u201cIt can be a battle asking people to think about animal issues without going over the top, because the line between awareness and paranoia is quite short. \u201d\nHe wants us to reflect on our understanding of animals, not only in the field of disease, but more widely.\nIt is not a population of dogs, cats, pigs and pangolins: we are also animals at one planet with all the others.\nKate Allen is a Toronto-based reporter covering science and technology.

Cruz, Manila, died on Saturday, Feb. 1, 2020, due to the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV-ARD).\nHe was the second confirmed case of the 2019-nCoV-ARD in the country and the first known death of someone outside mainland China. The World Health Organization (WHO) Philippines said the fatality was a close contact of the first confirmed case in the country.\n\u201cThey are both confirmed residents from Wuhan, China. He experienced symptoms of fever, cough and sore throat before being admitted at the San Lazaro Hospital,\u201d WHO Philippines said on its Facebook post.\nThe Department of Health (DOH) did not directly confirm whether the second case was infected by the 38-year-old Chinese female previously reported as the first positive case of 2019-nCoV-ARD in the country.\n\u201cAng malinaw lang (0ne thing is clear), they are partners,\u201d Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a press conference on Sunday, Feb. 2.\nDuque said the 44-year-old man who died had \u201cmixed infections\u201d aside from the novel coronavirus.\n\u201cWe should mention that in this patient (second case), meron din siyang (he already had) mixed pathogens. I would say, (it was a) mixed infection due to Influenza D,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, President Rodrigo Duterte issued his latest directive, approving the temporary ban of any person, regardless of nationality, except Filipino citizens and holders of permanent resident visa directly coming from China and its special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.\nDuterte made his decision upon the recommendation of the Inter-agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, which convened last Jan. 31 following the WHO\u2019s declaration of the 2019-nCoV-ARD outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern.\nDuterte also approved the temporary ban of entry of any person, except Filipinos and holders of permanent resident visa, who, within 14 days immediately preceding the arrival in the Philippines, has been to China and its special administrative regions.\nThe President mandated a 14-day quarantine for Filipinos and permanent resident visa holders coming from any place in China and its special administrative regions.\nHe also approved the temporary ban on Filipinos from travel to China and its special administrative regions.\nThe President also ordered the establishment of a repatriation and quarantine facility. He is set to preside over another meeting with the task force on Monday, Feb. 3.\nIn another development, the Chinese government has reported an outbreak of the deadly H5N1 bird flu in Hunan province, which lies on the southern border of Hubei province, the epicenter of the rapidly spreading coronavirus, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs on Saturday, Feb. 1, issued a statement that the outbreak \u201coccurred in a farm in the Shuangqing district of Shaoyang city. The farm has 7,850 chickens, and 4,500 of the chickens have died from the contagion. Local authorities have culled 17,828 poultry after the outbreak.\u201d\nNo human cases of the Hunan H5N1 virus have been reported.\nThe Hunan H5N1 outbreak comes even as Chinese authorities continue to scramble to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, further stretching the nation\u2019s already heavily strained resources needed to combat the health threats, the SCMP reported.\nThe Department of Tourism, in its official Facebook page, said they are coordinating with the travel and trade sector of the country to ensure the full implementation of Duterte\u2019s directive.\nThe Manila International Airport Authority advised passengers to and from China to coordinate with their airline or travel agencies for proper guidance and encouraged them to check airline websites for advisories.\nIn an advisory released on Sunday, Feb. 2, Philippine Airlines (PAL) canceled flights going to and coming from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau until Feb. 29, 2020.\nPAL said it will be cancelling flights between Manila and mainland China, particularly in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Xiamen and Quanzhou (Jinjiang). Flights to and from Special Administrative Regions, Hong Kong and Macau are also canceled.\nThe advisory did not include direct flights between Cebu and China. PAL said the ban also applies to their all-Filipino flight and cabin crew.\nStory continues As of 10:40 a.m., Sunday, the DOH reported 36 patients under investigation (PUIs) in the Philippines.\nOf the 36, two patients were confirmed positive for 2019-nCoV-ARD and four are still under investigation, while the remaining 30 were found negative of the infectious disease.\nHealth officials said of the 30 negative patients, 10 were already discharged.\nThe DOH ensured strict implementation of the travel ban in various ports around the country in coordination with the Bureau of Immigration, Department of Foreign Affairs and other concerned agencies.\nIn Central Visayas, the DOH recorded four PUIs. Three of them are currently admitted in a hospital while one, the five-year-old boy from Wuhan, was already discharged.\nThe 44-year-old fatality and his 38-year-old female partner came from Wuhan City, Hubei province, China, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV-ARD d.\nThey arrived in the Philippines via Hong Kong last Jan. 21.\nThe man was admitted for pneumonia last Jan. 25, after experiencing fever, cough and sore throat, said Duque said.\n\u201cOver the course of the patient\u2019s admission, he developed severe pneumonia. In his last few days, the patient was stable and showed signs of improvement. However, the condition of the patient deteriorated within the last 24 hours resulting in his demise,\u201d he said.\nHealth Undersecretary Rolando Enrique said they are scheduling the patient\u2019s remains for cremation. The DOH coordinated with the Chinese Embassy in Manila, informing the latter about the process.\nThe DOH initially revealed that the two were able to travel to Cebu and Dumaguete, Negros Oriental. The contact tracing procedures in Cebu and Dumaguete and in other places where the two patients stayed and traveled to are still ongoing.\nThe DOH-Epidemiology Bureau had secured the airline manifestos and it is in close coordination with the airlines.\nDuque emphasized the importance of proper hand washing and cough etiquette as effective prevention not only against the 2019-nCoV-ARD but also from other viruses.",

Earlier, Domingo said processing time on identifying whether a person is positive of the virus would be shorter by two to three days with the use of such kits. \u201cMatatanggal ang ( What will be removed is the ) travel or referral time, every time we need to send a specimen to Australia, it takes us about two days before we arrange it with a courier and for the government of Australia, because we\u2019re transporting potentially infectious materials so clearance takes time,\u201d he added. Domingo said there are six pending confirmatory testing results that were sent to Australia which the DOH expects to arrive on Thursday or Friday. He added there are no confirmed cases of the virus nationwide but 23 persons are under close surveillance in local health facilities for possible 2019-nCoV infection while four others have been discharged as they tested negative for the virus.",

        "content": "Outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan Wuhan city, capital of Hubei Province in China with a population of 11 million people and one of the 10 largest cities in China, was suddenly struck by a deadly virus called Corona. 11 cities in the near vicinity of Wuhan got affected the most by the virus and have been closed. Death toll has soared to 490, with 24,300 infected by virus across China, and 185000 under observation. 16 cities of China comprising 50 million people have been locked down as a safety measure to prevent the disease from spreading further. The virus has become a nightmare for China and is sucking the life out of thriving China. If it is not controlled in a short period, it could shatter the dream of China to become the world largest economy. Presently its economy is trailing behind USA only and is well poised to take the lead. In its bid to grapple with the Corona virus on war footing and eliminate it, China may be compelled to cut down taxes, increase expenditure, and lower interest rates to offset ill-effects of the virus. Impact of coronavirus on China\u2019s economy Production of electric cars and solar manufacturing by the US Company Tessa in Shanghai have stopped. General Motors, Toyota and Hyundai have delayed their productions till the return of workers from Lunar New Year holidays, which have been extended. Ford Motors factories are idling. Restrictions imposed on movement of employees of Apple Company which assembles most of its products in China is closing 42 stores in Wuhan. The US Real Estate Company \u201cThe Work\u201d has closed over 50 offices. Starbucks and multi-national Company IKEA have closed all the stores in China. Pizza Hut, KFC have shut thousands of its branches while McDonald has closed its outlet in five cities in Hubei province. Disney World has shut its parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Walmart with 430 stores in China has reduced work hours at some stores. International airlines like US Delta, Lufthansa and British Airways have canceled flights to China, while the US and many other countries have advised their people not to travel to China. Banks like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Chase have also directed their employees to stay home for some time. Adidas Sportswear Company with 12000 outlets in China has temporarily closed considerable numbers of stores. Toy industry in China is also likely to suffer. Isolation of big population centres has impacted the tourism industry. Prominent Travel Agencies and hotels are offering refund money to those who had done advance booking for February. Winter vacation celebrations and Lunar New Year celebrations have been cancelled and major tourism spots closed. Release of block buster films during the holiday season have also been deferred, which has caused a heavy loss to film industry. IMAX Film Company based in Toronto has postponed release of five films that were to be displayed during holiday break. China\u2019s 290 million workers will be worst affected. Majority of them travel from far flung rural areas daily to urban centers to work in factories or to earn daily labor wages. They are presently on New Year holidays and will have to stay at home due to closure of factories in the virus prone regions. It is feared that unemployment in China which is currently at 4-5%, would further fall down. Prices of food items are likely to soar. Economists foresee a drop of 2% in China\u2019s GDP resulting in loss of $ 62 billion. This heavy jolt could make China\u2019s flourishing economy anemic. China\u2019s growth rate had slid down last year from over 11% to 6.1%, and was the lowest in the last three decades. It is likely to slip to 5.6% this year. Reason was the US trade sanctions and tariffs on China\u2019s goods in 2018/19. Trade war impelled multi-national companies to shift from China to other countries such as Vietnam to avoid US tariff. Other reasons were increasing foreign debts owing to largescale development works in Western China, gigantic OBOR project, and modernization of Chinese armed forces. Shares in China fell by 8%. China\u2019s economists visualize that if this virus remain in vogue till March this year, the economy will suffer a loss of 5%. China\u2019s responses Power is centralized in a huge bureaucracy that emanates from the national Communist Party in Beijing. The latter has appointed the prime minister as head of the anti-virus campaign which is an indication that Beijing see this challenge as the top most national issue. There is a fascinating mix of calm and fear in China. Everything the media broadcasts or the government does centers around Corona Virus. Early on, the government was criticized for its slow response to the disease. But now, its response has swung into action and is putting in its heart and soul to combat the virus. Preventive measures have been taken which include:\u2022 Buses and trains crossing provincial lines in over half of China\u2019s provinces have been canceled.\u2022 Movie theaters, museums and other enclosed public spaces have been ordered to be closed.\u2022 Wuhan and other cities in the province of Hubei have prevented their locals from leaving. Sealing of cities is not easy, but having done it speaks of the strength of the state. Unlike screaming headlines in the newspapers of the world and social media going bloopers in sensationalizing the virus crisis, the media in China has taken things calmly and coolly. What were flashed in the newspapers were Xi Jinping giving four keys to win the fight against the virus: \u201cFirmly believe/have confidence in the government\u201d; \u201cCooperate\u201d; \u201cUse scientific disease control methods; \u201cApply targeted government policies.\u201d To encourage people and to inject patriotism, one of the sub headline was in the newspapers was: \u201cThanks to \u2018socialism\u2019 with Chinese characteristics\u2019, they\u2019ve built two hospitals in Huoshensan and Leishensan in six days, more are under construction. Thousands of doctors have been dispatched to Wuhan, which has been sterilized, and are coordinating scientific research\u201d. \u201cPrevention and control of the new coronavirus is the most important thing for us right now.\u201d Likewise, TV news aims to strike the right balance between alarm and assurance. While reporting the infected cases, the patients that have been treated and released were also reported. Wholesale markets with full stock of food items were splashed. Symptoms and preventive measures to fight the virus are explained. Infrared thermometers have been placed at nodal points to detect the virus and masks are being used extensively. An amount of $12-16 billion has been allocated for the treatment of affecters, to build hospitals, import necessary equipment and for health research work. Big banks are giving loans on low interest rate to the affected families to help them in undertaking small scale businesses. Bank of China has announced that it will keep extending loans to the most affected cities of Hubei province for several months. China plans to inject $ 22 billion to shore up money markets. China\u2019s contributions in global economy China with the population of 1.4 billion is the biggest manufacturer of the world and is second to none in crude oil reserves. Chinese tourists are among the top spenders in world tourism. They undertook 150 million tours in 2018 and spent $ 277 billion. China\u2019s importance in global economy has grown exponentially and is among the world largest traders and its merchandise is imported by almost all the countries due to its low-value products like clothing, plastic goods. China has gained monopoly in smart phones, computers and auto parts. USA, Japan and India and many others are the biggest importers of Chinese goods. Brazil is the biggest exporter of its goods to China. Its economy is export oriented, and its annual economic output has multiplied to about $ 14 trillion from 1.7 trillion in 2003. Its share in global trade doubled to 12.8 % in 2019 from 5.3 %. China accounts for one-third (20%) of global economic growth, and is also a massive consumer market. Being at the heart of many global supply chains, slowed down growth and imports/exports will have serious effects on the global trade. Asia-Pacific region will be the first to suffer the consequences. Chairman US Federal Reserve Bank Powell stated that \u2018China\u2019s economy is very important for the global economy and that decline in Chinese economy has a direct bearing upon the world economy\u2019. Countries affected by virus It is not only China but several other countries where cases of Corona virus have been detected. These include, USA (11 cases), Latin America, EU, Central Asia, ASEAN, South Asia, Africa, and Middle East. 25 countries have confirmed cases. One death each has occurred in Hong Kong and Philippines. 3600 persons returning from China have been quarantined by Hong Kong. 350 Americans have been airlifted from Wuhan and are currently secluded at California airbase for 14 days.10 infected cases detected on board cruise ship have also been isolated off Japan. Tokyo is worried about the fate of Olympics which it will host in July this year. Impact on Global economy The coronavirus will have a huge negative impact on China\u2019s economy, but other countries that are in business with China will also get affected. It has slowed the global growth to 2.9% this year. The world trading centres have been shaken to their roots by the virus and economic strains in China. The investors have begun to invest their amounts in US dollars, Japanese Yen and gold. Preventive measures taken by China have declined its demand for oil and other supplies. It has in turn brought down prices of oil and items. Countries trading with China including EU would not remain unaffected. Effects are already discernible as in the cases of stock market and bond market that have plunged. Brent\u2019s crude oil trade has slumped from $ 55 a barrel to $10. OPEC is planning to cut down oil production by 2 million barrels per day to avoid surplus. If not controlled, Corona virus will disrupt China\u2019s supply chain stretching from Mexico to Malaysia and will throw a spanner in the industrial growth of South Korea, Japan and Germany and will impact the global economy. Surge in prices in China will hit hard Pakistan\u2019s manufacturing sector which imports raw material from China. This factor together with possible rise in oil price will further shoot up inflation and price hike in Pakistan. Virus will also have an impact on thousands of Chinese work force employed in CPEC projects who are presently on vacations and have delayed their return. Despite the health hazards of the coronavirus, the economic impact and drastic reduction in tourism, other than Wuhan, life goes on as usual in other parts of China. Families are still enjoying Chinese New Year together at home, flying kites in the park, shopping at Walmart, and eating at McDonald\u2019s. In a cool and methodical manner, China is on its way to control this menace, and is confident that it will be able to control it as it had done against 2002 SARS virus, which was quickly overcome in 2003. China has claimed that its Zhejiang University has invented an effective drug to cure the disease which will be in the market soon and marketed to other countries. Talk of a vaccine is in the air. WHO has however stated that so far there is no effective treatment to cure the disease! ",

        "content": "nCov virus shows China is ground zero for some dangerous new infections With the number of new Chinese cases and infections in Thailand, Japan and South Korea, fears are growing that spread will intensify as hundreds travel this week 21 January 2020 - 11:22 Dong Lyu, Jinshan Hong and Tongjian Dong Medical staff carry a box as they walk at the Jinyintan hospital, where the patients with pneumonia caused by the new strain of coronavirus are being treated, in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, on January 10 2020. Leaning over a metal cage stuffed with live hens in Shanghai, Ran looked for just the right specimen for her chicken soup. The 60-year-old was shopping at one of China\u2019s wet markets, where sales of freshly slaughtered, unpackaged meat have become the focus of an investigation into an outbreak of a potentially deadly lung virus.\nFour people have died and more than 200 have been infected, including 15 medical professionals. The new virus is a cousin of the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which killed almost 800 people 17 years ago.\nKnown as 2019-nCov, the new coronavirus was first found in people who shopped or worked at a wet market in the central city of Wuhan. The pathogen may have been transmitted to humans from live animals sold there.\nSixty years after the Asian influenza pandemic and almost two decades after Sars, China remains ground zero for the emergence of many dangerous new infections. Asia\u2019s wet markets, where shoppers mingle in narrow spaces with everything from live poultry to snakes, are seen as a key reason.\nChina has made strides in monitoring and detecting infectious diseases since Sars and tightened controls on the sale of exotic animals, considered nourishing in some parts of the country. Yet the markets, which offer conditions that can set off potentially deadly contagions, remain popular and a central part of life in many cities.\nChina says deadly coronavirus is spreading Number of cases soars in outbreak of human-to-human transmission of SARS-like virus World 1 week ago \u201cFreshly killed hens are much better than frozen meat in supermarkets, if you want to make perfect chicken soup,\u201d said Ran, who did not want to give her full name. \u201cThe flavour is richer.\u201d\nPreference for fresh meat from animals that aren\u2019t properly quarantined or from the wild \u201cdoes make China susceptible to the risk of new virus outbreaks through close animal and human contact\u201d, said Wang Yuedan, a professor of immunology at Peking University\u2019s School of Basic Medical Sciences. \u201cThe same is true for Ebola, which came about as a result of eating animals from the forest in Africa.\u201d\nWith the surging number of new Chinese cases and infections found in Thailand, Japan and South Korea, fears are growing that spread will intensify as hundreds travel for the Spring Festival holiday this week. Wet markets are often thronged as fresh meat is procured for the lavish, banquet-style feasts that mark the start of the Chinese New Year.\nIt\u2019s also a peak travel season for Chinese citizens, as the full week of public holidays gives time for trips abroad. Airports around the world have put in place measures to screen arriving travellers for symptoms such as fever and coughing.\nOver the weekend, the Shanghai wet market was crowded with more than 100 customers inspecting and choosing chickens, which were then taken to an adjacent stall for on-site killing. The markets, typically large open buildings, also commonly offer seafood and pigs, as well as fruits and vegetables.\nMore exotic creatures such as snakes and marmots are harder to spot since the days of Sars \u2014 thought to have spread through civet cats \u2014 but are sometimes sold surreptitiously.\nWhile the outbreak has rattled equity markets, the virus is likely not to be as deadly or infectious as Sars. There are signs of spread from person-to-person, but it doesn\u2019t seem to do so easily, said Takeshi Kasai, World Health Organisation (WHO) regional director for the Western Pacific, in an interview with Bloomberg TV.\nChina confirms human-to-human transmission of new coronavirus WHO convenes an emergency meeting as number of cases more than triples and outbreak spreads to South Korea World 1 week ago Chinese authorities said that the outbreak is \u201cstill preventable and controllable\u201d.\n\u201cIf this were as infectious as influenza, we would expect to see more rapid spread around China and globally,\u201d said Raina MacIntyre, professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales. \u201cHaving said that, viruses can mutate and change during the course of an epidemic.\u201d\nChina is closely acquainted with deadly pathogens. The Asian flu pandemic that emerged from wild ducks in 1957 killed as many as two-million people globally, according to the WHO. Sars may have spread from bats to humans via masked palm civets and other species in live-animal markets before it began infecting people.\nTwo strains of avian flu in the past decade also may have emerged from a poultry market and a goose farm.\nChina has come a long way since Sars, when the country was criticised for initially providing limited information and denying the scope of the problem. The epidemic revealed how poorly the nation was prepared to respond to infectious disease threats.\nSince then, police and market regulators have launched crackdowns on the underground trade of wild animals, prohibiting the hunting and sale of endangered, rare and protected species. The government has opened up labs and networks to identify infectious pathogens. Ironically, its flagship lab is in Wuhan.\nStill, rapid urbanisation and a dramatic increase in the movement of people and goods has meant that disease outbreak events happen every week in the west Pacific region, according to a WHO statement.\nChina\u2019s vast size and population presents its policymakers with a Sisyphean-like task in trying to eradicate the threat from its wet markets. The virus outbreak comes as the country also faces African swine fever, the deadly pig disease that doesn\u2019t harm humans but has devastated the pork industry.\nLiu Yuanfei, who used to be a regular shopper at the Wuhan wholesale market where the virus is suspected to have emerged, recalls seeing live crocodiles, hedgehogs and deer there. Despite what\u2019s happened, he\u2019s sorry to see it shut down.\n\u201cWhen some crisis happens, people start to ask why, why, why,\u201d said Liu. \u201cBut the existence of the market is driven by demand. As long as there\u2019s demand, even if it doesn\u2019t show up here, it will show up somewhere else.\u201d\nBloomberg\nChina steps up efforts to contain virus as 17 more infected Wuhan's health authority confirms 17 more cases of the virus World 1 week ago SARS-like virus claims third victim and spreads around China Coronavirus strain raises spectre of epidemic that killed nearly 650 people in 2002-\u201903 World 1 week ago Second case of new Chinese virus diagnosed in Thailand Japan has also reported one case with the World Health Organisation saying the Wuhan virus could spread and warning hospitals worldwide",

The present Corona virus is a novel Corona Virus, a new strain of Corona Virus that has not been previously identified in humans, it added.\nCommon symptoms include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.\nMedikhru has asked the RRTs to ensure adequate readiness for immediate detection, intervention and mitigation, as and when the need arise.\nDimapur Airport Authority has also been asked to share list of passenger travelling from China and other affected countries transiting Kolkata airport for onward journey to Dimapur with Health and Family Welfare Department for early detection and intervention. Medikhru, in a letter to AAI Director, said Dimapur District Health Authority would be in touch with Airport Authority of India through the district surveillance unit.\nMoreover, medical superintendents of all the districts have been directed to earmark isolation room with ventilator facilities to deal with possible positive cases of the corona virus.

        "content": "Today\u2019s daily news roundup, mostly bad but with some good news in the end.\nFirst, in just a little over a month, nCoV fatalities already exceed the eight-month total of the more lethal SARS showing that it is not just the mortality rate that matters but also the much quicker spread of the nCoV virus.\nSecond, Singapore has been showing lots of infection by people who have had no history of travel to China. Infection clusters have been linked to a retail store, a church, and an international conference. The latter one has been linked to cases of Malaysian and German infectees who attended the seminar.\nThird, I am getting a lot more information about the movements pre-isolation of the dozens of infected persons in Singapore than about the three confirmed cases in the Philippines.\nFourth, the official Philippines figure remains at only three infected persons but it would be wise to assume that the actual total is much higher given the poor monitoring or tracing system that Philippine authorities have put in place. Note that countries that put up a more robust tracing and diagnostic system and just like the Philippines have seen substantial traffic from China, e.g. Japan, Singapore, or Korea, have much higher numbers of infected people. Safe to assume ours is about the same numbers, or even higher given the poor dissemination of information.\nFifth, transmission is no longer between family members who are in constant contact. Infectees include staff of retail stores where contact with an infected customer is probably limited to just a few minutes, a tour bus driver where contact is limited to during the drive, to conference attendees where again contact with the infected person is limited to minutes.\nSixth, transmission by Chinese travellers not originating from Hubei (Wuhan) but from other provinces in China has been reported. This is consistent with the forecast of Chinese scientists that other provinces and metropolis such as Shanghai and Guangdong may have localised outbreaks too. Hence, coupled with the information that approximately 5 million from Wuhan escaped before the lockdown, this makes the China wide travel ban more sensible.\nNow, for a bit of good news. Both Thailand and China reported to have found a cure for the nCoV, a combination of antibiotics, conventional flu medication, and HIV retrovirals. But whether or not it will be widely available outside China is another matter. Furthermore, Chinese authorities, with the lockdown of several cities (not just Wuhan) expect a downturn in the rate of infection. Let us hope they are right and that hopefully, other countries that have put in place a robust response will follow. ",

Further tests will show whether she actually has the virus. There is now \u201cincreased attention\u201d at Vienna Airport. In any case, the plans for crises are ready. In China, however, the number of deaths continued to increase.\nSince Saturday evening, a young woman who had spent two days in Wuhan, China, has been lying in an isolation room of the Emperor Franz Josef Hospital in Vienna and then landed in Schwechat as part of the flight crew. It could be infected with the corona virus. In any case, her illness was and is classified as the first suspected case in Austria. A confirmation or all-clear will only be given on Monday, emphasized virologist Judith Aberle from MedUni Vienna on Sunday at a press conference called in a hurry.\nSabine Hagenauer, the responsible senior physician, reported: \u201cThe patient is doing well at the moment. Much better than on Saturday. Her general condition is comparable to that of a flu-like infection.\u201d\nSN / APA / HERBERT PFARRHOFER\nFrom left: Sabine Hagenauer (4th Medical Department KFJ, Infection Department), Michael Binder (Medical Director of the KAV) and Judith Aberle (Department of Virology, Medical University of Vienna) at the press conference.\nThe rescue was informed of the case at around 9:30 p.m. on Saturday. The flight attendant, who has been in Vienna since Thursday, had felt increasingly uncomfortable in her hotel room. Fearing that she would be infected with the corona virus, she called for rescue. The woman was taken directly to the Emperor Franz Josef Hospital via a side entrance.\nShe is looked after by a special team in one of the four isolation rooms, which are equipped with locks and negative pressure. \u201cEbola patients could also be accommodated in these rooms,\u201d said senior physician Hagenauer. Regarding the course of the disease of people who are infected with the coronavirus, the rate of severe courses is around 25 percent. \u201cHowever, the death rate is very low,\u201d said Hagenauer. Panic is not appropriate: \u201cInfluenza is also very dangerous. Because we know it, it is not perceived as such.\u201d\nAll persons who have been in contact with the flight attendant have already been informed. \u201cThey are all symptom-free,\u201d said Ursula Kanthaler of the City of Vienna\u2019s Health Service (MA15). However, since the incubation period is up to 14 days, they are still observed. Kanthaler: \u201cIf the suspicion is confirmed, we will contact everyone who was on the plane.\u201d\nSN / apa\nThe isolation station in the infection department of the Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital in Vienna.\nWith the Viennese professional rescue you are not yet on high alert. \u201cIn principle, all ambulances in Vienna are prepared for infectious diseases. The means that are currently sufficient are a protective mask, gloves and disinfectants,\u201d says Andreas Huber, spokesman for the Vienna Occupational Rescue Service on request from the SN. The paramedics that the woman transported from China had been prepared and equipped with respiratory protection. \u201cLike all other contacts, you should observe possible symptoms.\u201d Increased attention at the airport\nThere is now \u201cincreased attention\u201d at Vienna Airport in Schwechat. Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann stated: \u201cWe are in constant contact with the authorities.\u201d Vienna Airport has a medical station that is open around the clock. Kleemann also referred to the corresponding deployment plans, which would have proven useful in the case of a case of SARS in 2014. \u201cThese can come into effect very quickly,\u201d said Kleemann. There are no direct flights from Schwechat to the affected areas in China.\nMinister of Health Rudolf Anschober (Greens) already issued a regulation on Saturday in accordance with the Austrian Epidemic Act, according to which the novel corona virus is subject to a disclosure requirement. Cases of suspicion, illness and death are subject to notification. \u201cThis is not a reason to panic, but for increased provision, information and attention.\u201d\nAccording to the Foreign Ministry, there are currently around 3,000 Austrians in China, both Austrians abroad and tourists. \u201cNo illnesses are known to exist in Austria at the moment,\u201d said Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg (\u00d6VP). Parallels to the SARS pandemic\nThe new corona virus, which is currently making headlines worldwide from the Chinese region around Wuhan, is very similar to the SARS pathogen. \u201cIf it is possible to limit the spread, the virus can disappear again,\u201d said the Viennese virology doye Franz X. Heinz on Saturday. In Austria there were no illnesses in connection with the SARS pandemic that was raging in 2002/2003, but the authorities then took extensive measures to be prepared for an emergency. After the first of several suspected cases occurred in mid-March 2003, doctors and medical technicians were available around the clock to examine samples in a laboratory of the Agency for Health and Food Security (AGES). The Ministry of Health set up its own hotline for inquiries from the population. A blood test to detect the lung disease was available in Austria from April 1. According to the Ministry of Health, 70 beds would have been available in the hospitals for SARS patients.\nThe first suspected case concerned a woman who had returned to Austria from China and complained of SARS-like symptoms in Vienna. The disease was not diagnosed in her, nor in other patients in the federal capital and in the federal states. The suspected cases usually concerned people who had come to Austria from East Asia or relatives. Three cases in France\nMeanwhile, three cases of illness have been confirmed in France. A couple who were being treated at the Bichat hospital in Paris had returned from a stay in Wuhan on January 18, a 48-year-old French man of Chinese origin who is in the wine business and travels regularly between France and China is being treated in Bordeaux. The patients are apparently not seriously ill.\nThe first case of infection with the corona virus is also reported from Canada. The Toronto health authority said it was a man who recently returned from Wuhan. His condition is stable. The new viral disease is being taken particularly seriously in Canada. With 44 deaths in 2002/2003, the country was the only country outside of Asia to suffer deaths from the SARS virus. Diseases with the new virus have also been registered in the USA, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Australia. 56 deaths in China\nIn China, however, the number of deaths has continued to increase. According to the Chinese authorities, at least 56 people have died from the respiratory disease so far. There was also a first death in the financial metropolis of Shanghai. The dead are said to be an 88-year-old man who already had existing health problems, the city authorities said on Sunday. So far, a total of 40 cases of respiratory illness have been confirmed in the metropolis. The number of people infected across the People\u2019s Republic is said to be over 1,975.\nChinese leader Xi Jinping convened a crisis meeting in Beijing on Saturday. All levels of the party and government must give top priority to the fight against the corona virus, he said, according to the official Xinhua news agency. The party had set up a working group to guide the process. Teams would be sent to Hubei Province to manage the work on the ground. Chinese cities in a state of emergency\nThe provincial capital of Hubei, the metropolis of Wuhan, is particularly badly affected by the corona virus: a few weeks ago, the pathogen had probably spread to people at an animal market. Two special clinics for corona patients are already being built in the metropolis with eleven million inhabitants. The national health authorities sent more than 1,200 doctors and other medical personnel to Wuhan for reinforcement.\nIn the meantime, more than 40 million people in a dozen cities in the heart of China have been largely isolated from the outside world to prevent the virus from spreading further. The national health authority announced on Saturday that fever measuring stations would be set up in all public transport. Passengers suspected of infection would have to be taken to a medical facility \u201cimmediately\u201d. The southern Chinese city of Haikou decreed that all travelers from Hubei province around Wuhan should be isolated and medically examined in a hotel for 14 days.\nWildlife trade has been banned in response to the novel virus. Since it is suspected that the virus was transmitted from wild animals to humans, the market authorities also ordered that all breeding farms be quarantined. Not only the trade but also the transportation of wild animals is prohibited. All platforms \u2013 from fresh markets to supermarkets and restaurants to online shops \u2013 would have to stop selling.\nKindergartens, schools and universities remained closed in Beijing. The schools are currently closed due to the New Year holidays. The city itself should not be closed, said the government of Beijing.\nHong Kong imposed a \u201cvirus emergency\u201d on the financial metropolis, cut all air and fast train connections to and from Wuhan, and announced the closure of the two popular Disneyland and Ocean Park amusement parks. Disneyland Shanghai, where around 100,000 visitors were expected every day around the Chinese New Year, had previously been closed.\nChinese health minister Ma Xiaowei said that the transmission of the coronavirus would increase after the outbreak and the number of infections could increase further. The authorities know little about the new virus and are not sure about the risks of mutations in the virus, Ma said.",

A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.\nEpidemic situation in Vietnam:\nBy the morning of January 31, in Vietnam: A total of 5 confirmed cases have been reported for novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Of the 5 cases reported, 1 has been successfully cured . 97 suspected cases of infection with nCoV virus. Of these, 65 have been tested negative. 32 cases are being strictly isolated so as not to infect the community.\nWHO assesses the risk of this event to be very high in China, high at the regional level and moderate at the global level.\nViet Nam Ministry of Health has developed a treatment protocol and is implementing it in health centers in 63 provinces and cities. Symptoms:\nCommon signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Path of infection:\nCoronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. The virus spreads from person to person through close contact with infected body fluids.

        "content": "Testing COVID-19 Samples, Step by Step, Inside the Hartford HealthCare Lab April 23, 2020\nIn hospitals, nursing homes and facilities across Connecticut, thousands of Hartford Healthcare workers are working tirelessly to combat COVID-19. Not far from Hartford Hospital , another team is quietly carrying out a critical task that supports their colleagues on the frontlines.\nAt the Hartford HealthCare laboratory , the microbiology team is performing COVID-19 testing for Hartford HealthCare patients and employees. The lab provides microbiology testing for five of seven hospitals within the Hartford HealthCare system.\nWith a capacity to complete nearly 200 tests a day, the lab is in operation 24 hours a day to process the specimens. The lab is turning around results in 24 to 36 hours.\nA specimen\u2019s journey starts at one of the Hartford HealthCare drive-up testing sites. An oropharyngeal (oral) or nasopharyngeal (nasal) sample is collected, then transported to the lab receiving area. From there, it is sent to the Hartford HealthCare Microbiology Laboratory in Newington for testing.\nAt the lab, the specimen is heat-inactivated to ensure the virus is no longer infectious, protecting the laboratory technologists performing the procedure, or assay. The specimen is then placed onto an automated extraction instrument and loaded onto a dual amplification and detection instrument.\nCreating, or validating, an assay is something that the lab team had been preparing for in advance of the Coronavirus arrival in Connecticut. Giuseppe Mignosa, Regional Director of Laboratory Services, says the staff understood the urgency: \u201cThe m2000 is the molecular instrument we are using for the testing. As soon as the FDA cleared the m2000 assay for testing, we put it into action.\u201d\nMignosa says the skill and expertise of the team demonstrated during this crisis exemplifies what they are trained to do.\n\u201cThis could be the biggest moment in our lab\u2019s history,\u201d he said. \u201cIt typically takes a year to develop a test. We have been ready for this. We are here to support patient care.\u201d\nIn and out of the lab, the collaboration of several teams is on display.\n\u201cThe phlebotomy team continues the important work as the front-end patient facing lab staff,\u201d said Mignosa. \u201cEveryone is stepping up to the plate \u2013 coming to work every day, interacting with patients. All lab staff is performing other necessary blood testing for all inpatients in house. COVID-19 notwithstanding, we serve as the central lab of Hartford HealthCare.\u201d\nFor Mignosa, it comes down to a simple mission they\u2019ve had all along.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more proud of this team \u2013 everybody working toward the same goal of supporting patient care,\u201d he said. \u201cOur team has worked tirelessly, putting in extra hours, focused on this virus and providing the test results as efficiently as possible. This is why we do what we do.\u201d",

Currently there are over 40,000 confirmed cases worldwide and >900 deaths. It is important to recognize that 99% of these cases originate from China. Windsor and Essex County has no confirmed cases at this time. The risk of exposure to WEC residents remains low. Influenza continues to be a greater risk within our community and clients should be encouraged to protect themselves by getting immunized.\nThe case definition for 2019-nCoV has recently expanded the exposure criteria to include all travellers returning from mainland China. Persons under investigation (PUI) now include:\nAny person with fever and/or cough or difficulty breathing AND any of the following: Travel to mainland China in the 14 days before onset of illness\nOR Close contact with a confirmed or probable case of 2019-nCoV\nOR Close contact with a person with acute respiratory illness who has been to mainland China within 14 days prior to their illness onset\nIn addition, the Public Health Agency of Canada has updated guidance for travellers. It is now recommended that travellers who have been to Hubei province limit their contact with others for 14 days following arrival in Canada (self-isolation). These travellers are also asked to contact local public health upon arrival. Should recent travellers from Hubei present to office, please direct the client to contact the WECHU for self-isolation instructions.\nIt is anticipated that the revised case definition will impact the number of individuals requiring testing and challenge the capacity of our local emergency rooms and hospitals. In preparation for this surge and to reduce the risk of possible future exposures, the WECHU is highly recommending that all health care providers be N95 mask fit tested in preparation for screening and testing of symptomatic individuals that meet the case definition. For detailed processes to support the management of PUIs, please visit the WECHU website\u2019s Novel Coronavirus page in the \u201cFor Professionals\u201d resource section.\nThe 2019-nCoV is considered a disease of public health significance and therefore all cases meeting the above case definition must be reported to the WECHU immediately by calling 519-258-2146, ext. 1420 or 519-973-4510 for after-hours support. The novel Coronavirus investigation and reporting form included in this communication (and also available on our website) must also be completed and submitted. The WECHU also suggests that if symptomatic clients, with a travel history to China within the last 14 days, were seen and assessed but not tested based on the previous case definition, that the cases be reviewed and considered under the details of the new case definition and updated travel recommendations.",

        "content": "Philippines Suspected nCoV cases rise to 178 Mayen Jaymalin (The Philippine Star) - February 7, 2020 - 12:00am MANILA, Philippines \u2014 The number of persons under investigation (PUIs) for the 2019-novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019 nCoV ARD) continues to soar, but it is expected to drop dramatically within the next two months, according to the Department of Health (DOH). At a press conference yesterday, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III reported that the total number of PUIs nationwide had reached 178 as of yesterday. \u201cOf the total 178 PUIs, 147 are admitted in hospitals, 10 have refused admission and 16 have already been discharged under strict monitoring,\u201d Duque said. The health chief further noted that of the total number of PUIs, 84 have tested negative for the virus while laboratory test on samples taken from 127 PUIs are still pending. He said the DOH is now coordinating with the Philippine National Police (PNP) in requiring asymptomatic PUIs to be admitted in health facilities. \u201cWe are working with the PNP to compel these PUIs refusing admission to agree to undergo isolation and testing,\u201d he added. Duque stressed that identifying all the PUIs tested and confined is necessary to stop the threat of the potentially deadly virus. Meanwhile, DOH officials are discussing with public cemeteries the possibility of burying the remains of the Chinese national who died due to the nCoV. Private crematories have refused to cremate the victim. \u201cI have instructed the San Lazaro Hospital to coordinate with public cemeteries if they can just bury the corpse, because based on information, they don\u2019t have cremation there,\u201d Duque said. The government, he added, also needs to coordinate with the Chinese government since the initial agreement was for the remains to be cremated. Decline in 1-2 months Despite the increase, the number of PUIs for possible infection of the deadly virus is expected to drop in one to two months, according to the DOH. \u201cWe see a drop in cases in one to two months since we have already stopped the entry of travelers from China,\u201d Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said yesterday. \u201cSince there are no more travelers coming from China, we will just be monitoring those who are already here and the number of the PUIs will start to drop,\u201d Domingo added. The DOH official assured the public that all government and private hospitals with isolation rooms nationwide are ready and capable to admit suspected nCoV patients. He added that any hospital that would not admit PUIs or confirmed nCoV patients face losing its license to operate. \u201cIt\u2019s part of their licensing requirement, for big hospitals to have isolation rooms and capability to treat infectious illnesses. If they can\u2019t do that, their licenses can be revoked,\u201d Domingo said. Even the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) can cancel the accreditation of a hospital for refusing to accept patients needing treatment for nCoV. Domingo also noted that concerned government agencies are continuously tracing people who made contact with the three confirmed cases of nCoV infection in the country. The government, he said, is also undertaking the necessary preparations for the repatriation of Filipinos from China. He added that repatriates would be tested before boarding the plane from their origin and upon arrival in the country. Meanwhile, the second Filipina household service worker (HSW) in Hong Kong quarantined following exposure to her nCoV-positive employer is healthy and asymptomatic , according to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA). The Philippine consulate general in Hong Kong verified with local health authorities that the Filipina was quarantined. \u201cThe consulate general reported that, just like the first case, the Filipina is healthy and asymptomatic but needs to undergo 14-day quarantine based on Hong Kong\u2019s protocol,\u201d the DFA said. Consul General Ray Tejada confirmed that the Filipina is the employee of a 39-year-old man, the first nCoV casualty in Hong Kong, who died of heart failure last Tuesday, according to reports. The DFA assured the public that the government has a vigilant and tested plan to ensure the health and welfare of Filipinos domestically and overseas amid concerns brought about by the nCoV outbreak. \u2013 With Pia Lee-Brago, Janvic Mateo The DFA continues to work closely with relevant government agencies to extend immediate assistance to Filipinos quarantined abroad. \u201cWe urge our countrymen in affected areas worldwide to abide by the guidelines of host countries and take the necessary personal precautions to ensure their health and safety,\u201d the DFA said. Schools\u2019 alert system An alert system first operationalized during the threat of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 will be activated in public schools nationwide as a precautionary measure against the nCoV. In a memorandum issued on Tuesday night, Education Secretary Leonor Briones directed school heads to operationalize the Preventive Alert System in Schools (PASS), which aims to monitor the health of students, teachers and other personnel. It seeks to establish a systematic relay of information on the state of health of a child or teacher to appropriate personnel or agencies in the locality. Former education secretary Edilberto de Jesus first operationalized PASS during the SARS outbreak in 2003. Under the system, students will be tapped to observe the wellbeing of their classmates and request them to report possible illnesses to teachers for validation. Teachers will also conduct early morning health inspections to detect the presence of fever and other signs and symptoms of infection. \u201cThe teacher shall keenly observe the health status of each learner in the classroom. If the teacher finds out that a learner is sick, this case will be reported immediately to the school head,\u201d the guidelines of the Department of Education (DepEd) read.

DECISION: Corona virus is spreading, but the organization says it is not a global emergency\nDr KK Aggarwal President CMAAO, HCFI and Past National President IMA\n1. At least 25 people have died and more than 800 have been sickened by the mysterious illness. The death toll increased by more than a half-dozen in 24 hours, while the number of confirmed cases jumped by more than 200.\n2. The travel restrictions imposed on Wuhan were extended to at least four more cities. The Chinese authorities on Thursday morning closed off Wuhan by cancelling flights and trains leaving the city, and suspending buses, subways and ferries within it. Late on Thursday, the local authorities also announced that they would suspend for-hire vehicles and limit taxis, beginning at noon on Friday.\n3. A patient died in the province of Hebei \u2014 more than 600 miles north of the city where the outbreak began.\n4. After two days of deliberations, an emergency committee convened by WHO decided not to declare a global health emergency \u2014 but planned to meet again within 10 days, acknowledging the \u201curgency\u201d of the situation.\n5. Agency officials explained that although the disease has reached beyond China, the number of cases in other countries is still relatively small, and the disease does not seem to be spreading within those countries.\n6. Currently, there is no evidence of human to human transmission outside China.\n7. This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency.\n8. Roughly 30,000 people fly out of Wuhan on an average day, according to air traffic data. Many more leave using ground transportation like trains and cars. By evening, officials planned to also close off Huanggang, a city of seven million about 30 miles east of Wuhan, shut rail stations in the nearby city of Ezhou, which has about one million residents, and impose travel restrictions on the smaller cities of Chibi and Zhijiang. In Huanggang, public transportation and departing trains stopped at midnight. Residents are not allowed to leave the city without special permission, according to a government statement. In Ezhou, all rail stations were to be closed.\n9. The new virus, which first emerged at the end of December, has sickened people in Taiwan, Vietnam, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea and the United States.\n10. It has raised the spectre of a repeat of the SARS epidemic, which broke out in China in 2002 and 2003 and spread rapidly while officials obscured the seriousness of the crisis. That virus eventually killed more than 800 people worldwide.",

        "content": "Scientists are hoping to find a cure for respiratory illnesses by studying a virus\u2019s mechanism of action \u2014 tracking it as it enters host cells and replicates inside them\nWhat is life? One way of looking at this question is by asking what we consider as living beings. We could claim that a living organism is something that is capable of replicating itself, that is, giving birth to new copies of itself. By this way of looking at life, many things emerge as living \u2014 animals, plants and humans.\nThen the simplest such organism is surely also the smallest, one made up of the least number of molecules? In this quest for the smallest replicating being, we could start at the level of single molecules and ask if there is any molecule that has the capacity to replicate itself. The short answer is no. The long answer is a story for another day.\nWorking up from here we can ask if a collection of a few molecules can find a way to reproduce itself. But first let us ponder a situation where, many millions of years ago, a few molecules capable of reproducing, but only when working in tandem, came together just by accident on the face of this Earth or deep inside its oceans. What would happen next is that, just by virtue of being able to replicate itself, this set of molecules \u2014 or form of life \u2014 would begin to take over the world. It could only be restrained by a competition for resources. The competition could come from another set of molecules \u2014 another life form competing for exactly the same molecules to build itself.\nTwo such groups of organisms arose millions of years ago on Earth, and they occasionally compete still: Bacteria and viruses. Viruses are the smaller of the two and can only replicate inside the cells of another living organism. In fact, they must hijack the machinery of another cell to reproduce themselves. This raises an interesting question. What arose first in evolution \u2014 the more complex organism or the simpler one that feeds off it?\nHow does a virus do it? Its first task is to enter the innards of a cell. Is a full entry required or will the insertion of only a part of the virus suffice? Different viruses have, over many millennia, evolved different strategies. In these strategies are contained the mysteries of their success and their virulence. It is the act of entering a cell that determines how infectious a virus is capable of being in its present avatar.\nCells \u2014 of bacteria, birds, pigs, dogs, humans and so on \u2014 are all contained inside an outer layer of molecules protecting the insides, much like the water inside a water-filled balloon is held in shape by the rubbery material of the balloon itself. The protective membranes of cells are made up of a multitude of molecules \u2014 fats, sugars and proteins \u2014 performing complex functions protecting the insides and regulating the entry and exit of myriad molecules. Numerous molecules stick outside of this membrane, sensing the flow of signals in the outside world. Some stick inside the cell to pass on messages. Many molecules do both.\nTo be successful a virus must find entry into a cell. Viruses have evolved molecules sticking out of their own surfaces that can dock on to the receptor molecules jutting out of cell membranes, to mediate entry inside animal cells. The more such receptors a virus can use to attach and enter, the more species it will be able to infect. From here on the virus proceeds to hijack its host cell into making many copies of itself.\nNow copies are hard to make. Try making a copy of an object, any object, and you will see that the replica is never a perfect one. Now this fact is a most dangerous one when living cells in multicellular organisms such as humans try to replicate, for they must ensure that their DNA \u2014 wherein lies their code of life \u2014 is replicated as flawlessly as possible. The failure to do so can result in rogue cells that grow out of control at the cost of the entire organism\u2019s health. Cancer is one such condition.\nBut such constraints do not hold in the case of unicellular organisms. Many viruses, in fact, have a replication machinery that is quite prone to error, leading to numerous variants within every replicant pool, each of which shall again multiply to produce many other variants. Such a swarm of viruses can quickly yield variants that have adapted to infect newer cell types in an altogether new species.\nCoronaviruses are one such viral group that infect many different species. Particularly lethal variants emerge occasionally. The epidemics of SARS and MERS in the recent past were caused by coronaviruses. A new one has just raised its head and is spreading fast.\nOne of the unique things about coronaviruses is that they have so-called spike proteins sticking out of their coats, one part of which uses ubiquitous sugar molecules on the surfaces of most cells to infect them, and the other evolves very rapidly, \u2018trying\u2019 to find matches to protein receptors. Once such a match is found the virus can jump to infect a new cell type and, often, a new species. A third part of this spike protein then fuses the virus through the cell membrane. In fact, the presence of multiple species of animals packed in close quarters in farms, breeding centres for industrial-scale production of meat as well as local markets, likely allows the virus to repeatedly migrate between species, continuously acquiring new genetic variations before moving on.\nNo cure is known for the respiratory illness caused by the coronaviruses, but an understanding of its mechanism of action, from entering host cells to replicating successfully inside them, is being used by scientists to try and find a cure to this and other viruses. We can imagine the form of such cures despite the technical difficulties of achieving them. Specially designed small molecules could block the spike protein surfaces of the current coronavirus and render it incapable of infecting its human hosts. Or, perhaps, a molecule could block a key viral enzyme whilst having no effect on human molecules.\nUntil, of course, a mutant emerges, against which this particular drug is ineffective.\nSuch is the nature of a rapidly evolving viral storm. Even errors have their uses. Such is life.",

Andanar said the DOTr has been closely coordinating with the DOH and the Bureau of Quarantine (BoQ) to support in securing transport terminals and in monitoring arriving passengers.\nTo contain the spread of the 2019-nCoV, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) has reactivated its communicable disease preparedness procedures on all CAAP-operated airports, especially those with international flights.\nAirport frontline personnel were likewise advised to follow precautionary measures, to exercise extreme vigilance in handling passenger arrivals, and to strictly monitor those who may be infected by the virus.\nThe Civil Aviation Board (CAB) also resolved to immediately and indefinitely suspend all air services operations between Wuhan and any point in the Philippines.\nMeanwhile, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has mandated all public utility vehicle (PUV) drivers and conductors to wear face masks at all times and have asked franchise holders to ensure compliance.\nTerminal operators were also directed to ensure proper sanitation and provide face masks and disinfectants or sanitizers for free, for passengers to use.\nThe Maritime Industry Authority (Marina), on the other hand, advised ship owners and operators to take the necessary measures to monitor the 2019-nCoV and to report suspected cases. They were also asked to install necessary medical equipment and to equip their personnel with full information about the virus.\n\u201cThe Marina has put in place monitoring procedures such as body temperature tests for people entering its building, wearing of masks for its frontline personnel, and the provision of alcohol dispensers at its entrances and comfort rooms. Its premises are also being regularly sanitized,\u201d Andanar said.\nKeep calm\nAndanar, however, sought the public\u2019s cooperation as the government undertakes measures to contain the spread of the virus.\n\u201cWe enjoin the public to be vigilant and conscientious, and to work with the authorities and follow their prescribed procedures and precautionary measures.

        "content": "A disease epidemic with the potential for pandemic proportions is upon us again. Unlike the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) which caught Liberia and neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea off guide, there is a worldwide alarm on the emergence of a coronavirus in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.\nThe Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV), aptly named after the Chinese city of its origin, is a respiratory illness that has so far caused 26 deaths and 830 cases and rising across China, according to the New York Times reporting. There has been confirmed cases of the disease in Thailand, Japan, South Korea and the United States.\nThe Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) belongs to the same family of diseases as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The disease is known to circulate among animals. However, there is a high likelihood that the disease has evolved thus spreading between people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. Chinese health authorities are reporting that the virus is adapting and mutating. That is, the virus is changing itself to suit its environment/host (the infected person).\nThe incubation period appears to be similar to those of SARS and MERS. For now, CDC researchers suggest that infected persons appear to exhibit symptoms between 2 to 14 days. The symptoms are pneumonia-like and they include fever, coughing and shortness of breath.\nGiven Liberia\u2019s relationship with China and the ease with which people travel between the two countries, the virus poses a likely threat to Liberia. To mitigate the threat, Liberia must initiate the following as recommended by the CDC: Establish, if it does not already exist, an incident management and emergency response system that will support any public health response to the outbreak of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Liberia. Condition the population to revert to the same mindset and preparedness posture as was exhibited during the 2014 Ebola epidemic. Stock up on face masks and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for medical staff in the event there is an outbreak. Issue travel advisory to people traveling to southeast and south Asia that will include warnings such as: \u2013 Avoid physical contact with people who may appear sick. \u2013 Avoid contact with animals and uncooked meat. \u2013 Wash your hands as often as you can with soap or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. \u2013 Cover nose and mouth when sneezing. \u2013 Seek medical attention immediately should you get sick while in Asia.\n5. Dispatch medical staff to all ports of entry to conduct screening of all travelers entering the country especially people coming from southeast and south Asia. This may be challenging since Liberia may not yet have the testing mechanisms to test for coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Nonetheless, Liberia can use the Ebola method for examining body temperature. However, the CDC has developed a real time test called Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR). While the tests are not widely available, CDC plans to make the tests available to its partners through CDC\u2019s International Reagent Resource @ https://www.internationalreagentresource.org/\nNew and emerging diseases are becoming deadlier in little time than imaginable. That makes it more urgent that public health authorities in Liberia are given the resources needed to fight the threat these diseases pose. I will hope the government makes available the resources necessary to guide against the potential threat of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Liberia. Dr. Taiyee Quenneh",

Hyderabad: The new strain of corona virus found recently in China affects the lungs and causes acute respiratory distress syndrome according to pulmonologists who are following the case. This causes lungs to fill with fluid and air is not able to get in.\nDr C. Vijay Kumar, senior pulmonologist at Apollo Hospitals, says the treated cases have shown that the impact on the lungs is severe. \u201cThe virus is found to attack the lungs faster than expected from the group of corona viruses. This indicates that the virus is virulent in nature,\u201d he said.\nCorona viruses are zoonotic which means that they are transmitted from animals to humans. This large family of viruses cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to severe pneumonia. It can also lead to death. Corona viruses mutate for survival and they look for favourable conditions where they can survive.\nThe SARS CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans, MERS-CoV was from dromedary camels to humans and H1N1 virus came from the intestines of pigs. There are several viruses in the bodies of animals but they do not infect humans.\nMany corona viruses are also self-limiting in nature. It is only those that undergo mutation that are a cause of worry. The cycle of mutation is noted every three to four years.\nEvery year, there is a new strain of virus and the vaccination schedule is based on these strains. While vaccination is a protection it is not completely so as its efficacy is only between 60 to 70 per cent.\nSince the last five years it has been found that flu vaccinations are not working as required as there are many different strains of viruses around.\nDr Mehboob Khan, superintendent of Chest Hospital explained, \u201cWhy do we need to know the strain of the virus? Because the strain helps us decide on the medications that are to be used. Common flu has a single medicine which works for all. But if there is a new strain or a mutated strain, the existing medicines will require different combinations to control spread of the virus in the body.\u201d\nWhen the human body is infected, the immune system fights the virus. While the immune system is engaged with the virus, dormant bad bacteria in the lungs get active and they attack the body.\nThe virus is self-limiting and will die, and it is the bacteria which creates secondary infection like lung collapse, kidney damage or multi-organ failure leading to death.",

Samples from four (4) other PUIs are currently being tested at RITM.\nThe two confirmed cases are the previously-announced 38-year-old Chinese female and her companion, a 44-year-old Chinese male who were both admitted for isolation and supportive treatment at San Lazaro Hospital in Sta. Cruz, Manila. Both patients are from Wuhan, China and arrived in the Philippines via Hong Kong last January 21, 2020. The second confirmed case was admitted for pneumonia last January 25, 2020 after experiencing fever, cough, and sore throat.\nDOH also confirmed that the 44-year-old male died yesterday, February 1, 2020. Over the course of the patient\u2019s admission, he developed severe pneumonia due to viral and bacterial infections (S. pneumoniae and Influenza B). In his last few days, the patient was stable and showed signs of improvement, however, the condition of the patient deteriorated within his last 24 hours resulting in his demise.\n\u201cI would like to emphasize that this is an imported case with no evidence of local transmission. We are currently working with the Chinese Embassy to ensure the dignified management of the remains according to national and international standards to contain the disease,\u201d Health Secretary Francisco T. Duque III said.\nDOH is assuring the public that all measures needed to contain the spread of the virus is being strictly implemented and followed. San Lazaro Hospital has implemented rigorous infection control protocols while caring for these patients. Both patients were isolated following strict isolation standards, and all health personnel who came in contact with them practiced stringent infection control measures and wore appropriate personal protective equipment.\nThe Epidemiology Bureau (EB) of the Department is currently conducting contact tracing of passengers aboard the flights of the two positive cases. EB has secured the manifestos of the flights and is in close coordination with the concerned airlines. Contact tracing activities are ongoing in Cebu and Dumaguete, and in other places where the patients stayed and traveled to.\n\u201cThe Philippine Government has already implemented a temporary travel ban for travelers coming from China, Macao, and Hong Kong. DOH is monitoring every development on the 2019-nCoV very closely and is taking proactive measures to contain the spread of this virus in our country. This health event is fast-evolving and fluid. We are continuously recalibrating our plans and efforts as the situation develops,\u201d Duque assured.\n\u201cWe are providing the public with constant updates and advisories as frequently as possible, so all I ask from the public now is to heed the advisories from official DOH channels and to refrain from sharing unverified and unvalidated information. I assure the public that we will keep you abreast of any information that we have,\u201d he added.\nCurrently, there are no reports of community spread of the virus within the country. However, the public is still reminded to practice prevention measures such as proper hand hygiene and observance of cough etiquette.\nAs of 12 NN yesterday, February 1, 2020, DOH has reported five (5) additional patients under investigation (PUIs), bringing the total recorded number of PUIs to thirty-six (36). Twenty-three (23) PUIs are currently admitted and isolated, while ten (10) have been discharged under strict monitoring. DOH also reported a total of two (2) confirmed cases with one (1) mortality. The previously-reported PUI mortality was found to be negative for 2019-nCoV.\n\u201cThe new developments warrant a more diligent approach in containing the threats of the 2019-nCoV. The Department of Health is continuously improving and scaling up its public health measures and reminds the public to remain calm and vigilant,\u201d Secretary Duque concluded.\n",

        "content": "Director-General World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the steps China took to fight the virus at its epicenter were a good way of stopping its spread. Dr Tedros praised the Chinese authorities for their response at the epicenter of the outbreak.\nAccording to a WHO report released, there are altogether 153 confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV outside China, which is less than one percent of the number in China.\nIn contrast, in 2009, the H1N1 flu in the US spread to 214 regions and countries. Thanks to China\u2019s efforts that they effectively contained the cross-border spread of the 2019-nCoV. WHO therefore applauded China, saying it\u2019s setting a new standard for outbreak response.\nThe fact is that since the onset of the outbreak, China has taken unprecedentedly strict prevention and control measures, many of which far exceed WHO recommendations and IHR requirements.\nChinese authorities first warned people to stop traveling in and out of Wuhan (the epicenter of the outbreak) , and then said they would put the city under quarantine beginning January 23rd , suspending public transport within Wuhan, and canceling flights and trains leaving the city. It was an extraordinary move given that Wuhan has a population of 11 million, more people than New York City.\nBy the evening of January 24, quarantine measures had expanded to 12 cities near Wuhan, effectively stifling the movement of 35 million people. By January 25, President Xi Jinping said the new virus posed a \u201cgrave\u201d threat, and his government ordered travel agencies to suspend tours for Chinese citizens inside China and overseas.\nChinese officials have already responded to the outbreak by quarantining millions of people in affected cities and restricting domestic and international travel. But some experts are questioning whether China has fully learned the lessons from the 2003 SARS outbreak.\nChina is doing all they can to contain the spread of the virus, and we witnessed their decisive actions to put in place strong measures. With the recent outbreak, the Chinese government has been much more willing to share information and be open.\nA coronavirus outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China, has killed at least 637 people and infected more than 30,000 since December. The virus might have jumped from animals to people at a Chinese wet market where living and dead animals were sold.\nSARS was also a coronavirus, and that outbreak started in a wet market, too. It killed 774 people and infected 8,098 between November 2002 and July 2003.\nThe Wuhan coronavirus shares 80% of its genome with the coronavirus responsible for the SARS outbreak, according to two new studies. The total Wuhan coronavirus case count surpassed that of SARS in just a month. It seems to be less deadly than SARS.\nOne of the biggest changes since SARS is advances in technology needed to understand the virus and develop diagnostic tests or treatments. Chinese scientists have already sequenced the virus, which first appeared in December. They\u2019ve also made that information available to scientists around the world.\nWith SARS, it took scientists about 5 months to identify the virus after it began to spread. New genetic technologies will be a game changer for how China and other countries handle the new coronavirus.\nEven with all of these new technologies available, it\u2019s going to come down to good disease surveillance, good case identification, and good contact tracing.\nDr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and his colleagues, said in a JAMA editorial Trusted Source that it was these kinds of \u201cclassic public health measures\u201d that brought the SARS epidemic to an end.",

Students from grades 6th -12th can win prizes by pitching their smart ideas to identify the next breakout and control the spread of another epidemic or pandemic. Students are given an opportunity to stop these viral diseases and save thousands of lives. The Thomas Edison Energy Smart Charter School (TEECS) is a Somerset, NJ based tuition-free public school focused on green/renewable energy.\nGovernments around the world are realizing the need for a collective and coordinated defense against these epidemics. International bodies like WHO and Red Cross are engaged in revision of the International Health Regulations, treatments and protocols to tackle emerging public health threats. Public awareness, co-operation and active public participation is important for controlling and eradicating these deadly disease. The idea of this program is to encourage bright young minds to find smart innovative solutions to control the spread of these diseases. It is a wonderful platform for young students with open minds to present their ideas for fighting global public health crisis.\nSurveillance of emerging infectious diseases is vital for the early identification of public health threats. Emergence of novel infections is linked to human factors such as population density, travel and trade and ecological factors like climate change and agricultural practices. A wealth of new technologies is becoming increasingly available not only for the rapid molecular identification of pathogens but also for the more accurate monitoring of infectious disease activity. Web-based surveillance tools and epidemic intelligence methods, used by all major public health institutions, are intended to facilitate risk assessment and timely outbreak detection.\nAnother Ebola epidemic, another plague epidemic or a new influenza pandemic are not mere probabilities, the threat is real. Whether transmitted by mosquitoes, other insects, via contact with animals or person-to-person, the only major uncertainty is when and where they, or a new, but equally lethal epidemic, will emerge.

        "content": "Emerging infectious diseases and Bhutan: the case of 2019-nCoV February 1, The worst pandemic in recent history was the 50-100 million deaths caused by the Spanish flu in 1918-1920. Bhutan was not spared from this pandemic where FM Bailey, the resident Political Officer in Gangtok wrote in his annual report that influenza had spread throughout Bhutan and that there were many fatal cases.\nIn the 1967 global outbreak of smallpox where 15 million people contracted the infection and 2 million died, there were 14 reported cases in Bhutan and the source was linked to the outbreak in neighbouring Assam. These events show that diseases know no boundaries and emerging diseases pose real challenges.\nEmerging diseases\nThere are 1,400 human pathogens and about 30 new infectious agents that were previously not experienced by humankind have been identified in the last three decades. These, called as emerging infectious diseases pose public health challenges by presenting as new diseases, appearing in new geographical locations or with new clinical features, and occurring in epidemic or pandemic scales.\nWhy are diseases emerging?\nThe emergence of new diseases depends on the factors that make up the epidemiologic triad: the host (human or animal), agent (pathogen), vector (that transmits the agent to the host) and the environment.\nSARS epidemic in 2002-2003, MERS outbreak in 2012 and the present Wuhan outbreak of 2019-2020 were caused by the evolution of new infectious agents. Development of resistance of agents to drugs or pesticides such as drug-resistant tuberculosis, HIV and malaria, and pesticide resistant malaria are some examples.\nEcological changes and human invasion of forested areas have been linked to diseases such as the Nipah virus (nearest reported outbreak near Bhutanese border was in Siliguri, 2001), scrub typhus and Japanese Encephalitis. International trade and travel are linked to the rapid spread of infectious agents. For example, travel from Hong Kong to Toronto by one person with SARS-CoV resulted in 128 SARS cases in a local hospital. Similarly, a single patient with MERS-CoV from Saudi Arabia who came to South Korea resulted in 186 MERS cases. Human behaviour involving close contact with civet cats were linked to the emergence of SARS and bushmeats (smoked animal meat) involving bats were associated with the emergence and spread of Ebola.\nCombating emerging infectious diseases\nEmerging and re-emerging infectious diseases will continue to challenge modern health systems. Outbreaks such as Ebola and the novel coronavirus in the affected countries have led to prolonged disruption of social and economic activities. Case recognition, case management, and active contact tracing are essential in controlling the initial outbreak of infectious diseases. This requires active public health intervention along with strong surveillance and laboratory networks, research and development, and sharing of information and partnership with centres with expertise. With increasing cross border travel, global cooperation is crucial to contain emerging infectious threats. The World Health Organization proposed the International Health Regulation 2005 to regulate global efforts in combatting common threats.\nInternational Health Regulation 2005\nThe International Health Regulation 2005 is a set of international laws that govern identification, surveillance and reporting of diseases that may be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Bhutan is a signatory to the IHR and has dedicated national framework for surveillance and reporting of internationally notifiable diseases (SARS, Smallpox, New influenza viruses, Wild-type polio) and other notifiable diseases that may be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The present 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, now declared a PHEIC, is a case example of the threats of global emerging infectious disease to the social and economic security of our country.\nThe 2019-novel Corona Virus\nIn December 2019, there appeared a cluster of pneumonias of unknown cause in Wuhan, China. By January 2020, it was identified that the disease was caused by a new type of virus, named by the World Health Organization, as the 2019-nCoV. This new virus has spread to 20 countries outside China with known human-to-human transmission. There are more than 9,000 confirmed cases and more than 200 fatalities with the number increasing by each hour.\nThe 2019-nCoV infection causes symptoms ranging from fever, cough and flu-like illnesses to more severe forms such as pneumonia and respiratory distress requiring intensive care support. While its fatality rate is lesser than other coronaviruses, it will pose significant clinical challenge as this virus has sustained human-to-human transmission.\nThe outbreak in China happened around the time when many Bhutanese travel to Thailand, India and Nepal. Pilgrimage sites in India and Nepal experience heavy traffic of visitors from many Asian countries, mostly from China. Back at home, the tourism industry is being sensitized on the preventive measures on the travel-related spread of the infection.\nHow do new corona viruses emerge?\nCorona viruses have been long considered inconsequential pathogens. They (Human Corona Viruses named HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) cause 10-30% of the upper respiratory tract infections (common cold) that are self-limiting in adults in the USA. However, two highly pathogenic types of corona viruses emerged: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (SARS-CoV) in Hong Kong in 2002-2003 and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia in 2012. SARS spread to 30 countries in Asia, Americas, Europe with 8,439 cases and 812 deaths within 7 to 8 months with an economic loss estimated USD 10-30 billion. The MERS-CoV infection has been reported from 27 countries with at least 722 deaths. Both these viruses have originated from animals and spill over to humans have caused human infections.\nThe origin of the 2019-nCoV has not yet been confirmed but like the SARS and MERS CoV, it is likely a spillover from zoonotic sources. However, with sustained human-to-human transmissions reported with MERS and 2019-nCoV, the virus can spread virtually to any place on earth due to human travel. The 2019-nCoV has predominantly lower respiratory symptoms and is spread through cough and close contact with infected individuals.\nThe medical and scientific community are still trying to understand the 2019-nCoV and the novel coronavirus infected pneumonia as more clinical and medical information are published in medical journals.\nBhutan\u2019s response to prevent 2019-nCoV entry\nThe Ministry of Health has led the multisectoral response in the prevention of the entry of the novel coronavirus into the country. This involves screening persons with symptoms of influenza such as fever, cough and malaise. The health workers are sensitized on the detection of cases. The Royal Centre of Disease Control, Thimphu has issued guidelines on the collection of samples from suspected cases and the hospitals are altered on the contingency plan to isolate and provide care of cases if detected. The government has issued travel advisory to avoid travel to countries.\nBoth the mainstream and social media are playing important roles in the sharing of information on the symptoms of the novel coronavirus infection and individual-level preventive measures such as washing hands and use of face masks. Rumours and misguided information play a very destructive role in such outbreaks and hamper public health intervention measures.\nCare of infectious diseases requires trained professionals and specialized centres such as infectious diseases hospital. For the time being, the Ministry of Health has identified specific centres and emergency teams for the isolation and treatment of novel coronavirus infected cases if detected.\nConclusion\nWhile there are multiple versions of epidemiologic projections on how and when the present coronavirus infection will end, it has also tested the response of the present development of our health system to countering emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Emerging diseases will continue to challenge in modern health systems in different forms and times.\n",

        "content": "0 Share W does he remember Zika? Long time no longer heard. In February 2016, five months before the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared global health emergency due to the mosquito-borne virus. The games were held under safety precautions, and the WHO lifted the state of emergency in November 2016. In November 2019, the Federal Foreign Office\u2019s health service announced that the number of cases in Central and South America was declining. So much for the good news. The bad news: the corona virus causes far more problems than Zika. The disease has long led to cancellations. The Formula E race planned for March 21 in Sanya on the Chinese holiday island of Hainan is canceled. The same is threatening the Formula 1 Grand Prix, which is to be held at Shanghai four weeks later. At the end of last week, the organizers of the Tokyo Olympic Games had to emphasize that a cancellation of the games is currently not being considered. On Monday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said they were working with the WHO to avoid negative effects on the games. Olympic organizers and association officials want to advise on how to deal with the virus. Since the weekend, Japan has been refusing entry to foreigners who have been in the Chinese province of Hubei in the past two weeks. Even people who have a passport issued in Hubei are no longer allowed to go to Japan.\nManon Priebe\nRecommendations: 54 In Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison\u2019s government imposed an almost complete ban on travelers from China. Exceptions are made only for Australian citizens, permanent residents and their relatives. The conservative head of government, heavily criticized for the ongoing climate and bushfire crisis, is resorting to rigorous means. The Asian Football Confederation is quickly coming under pressure. She had placed Chinese clubs\u2019 home games at the end of the Champions League group stage at the end of next week \u2013 and more likely to give them a competitive advantage. However, Shanghai Shenhua is due to start in Perth next Tuesday, Shanghai SIPG the next day at Sydney FC \u2013 impossible under Morrison\u2019s policies. This Tuesday, the East Asian associations want to advise how to deal with the Corona crisis. Hosting in a neutral place? That would not do justice to the fear of contagion expressed in Morrison\u2019s entry ban, as it may seem exaggerated. Shift? Cancellation? The continental futsal tournament, scheduled for three weeks in Turkmenistan, has been postponed indefinitely. This also shows that Corona has been the greatest health challenge in sport in recent years. China\u2019s anti-doping agency said on Monday that it had decided to suspend doping controls until further notice. Health protection is given as the reason. Who is this good news for? Not for equal opportunities, viewed objectively. If you look at doping plans from the past, you have black and white in front of you: the best performances of summer are made in winter. And how much of the competition is infected by the suspicion is not only demonstrated by every start of the Chinese swimmer Sun Yang. In any case, nothing can be heard of the end of the cynicism, which has already and especially in China, won in the fight of the Communist Party against Corona.\n,",

Earlier this week, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported that Xiang Hu Bao, a blockchain-based insurance claim platform, has added claims for the coronavirus to the list of illnesses covered as a part of its payouts. Insurance Payouts on a Blockchain Platform\nAs the SCMP noted, insurance companies from across China have been using Xiang Hu Bao to handle claims regarding the coronavirus. The platform is owned by Hangzhou-based financial services giant Ant Financial, and it already counts 104 million users. By adding the coronavirus claim to its platform, insurance companies that offer cover for this disease will now be able to use the platform to make faster and more effective claim handlings.\n\u201cXiang Hu Bao has been able to process claims and make payouts to participants quicker, due to the decentralized, trust-free nature of blockchain technology. [\u2026] Claim applicants can submit their supporting documents as evidence, while investigation firms can get immediate access to them on the blockchain. All parties involved can see the entire process,\u201d a spokesperson for the platform said to the SCMP.\nPeople who register will be able to access a one-time payment of 100,000 Yuan (about $14,000) to take care of themselves as China continues to tackle what is becoming the most widespread global pandemic since the Ebola outbreak of 2014. The death toll for the disease has already toped 900 people in the country alone, and today was particularly deadly- over 97 deaths have been confirmed in the past 24 hours alone. More Reason for Everyone to Embrace Blockchain\nHowever, the fact that blockchain can be used to help make insurance claims even more effective will provide yet another use case for the country- additional encouragement in its mission to bolster just about every aspect of its economy with blockchain.\nOver the past few months, several firms and government agencies have filed for blockchain-based patents in China, in compliance with a directive from President Xi Jinping to adopt the technology across their operations. As blockchain gets more use in the country, a lot of skeptics in the country could begin to even show support for the country in its bid to issue a digital asset and place its monetary economic growth in the hands of this new technology. Jimmy Aki Jimmy has been following the development of blockchain for several years, and he is optimistic about its potential to democratize the financial system.",

        "content": "Without a single COVID-19 death, Vietnam starts easing its coronavirus lockdown Offering a rare and surprising bright spot in the COVID-19 pandemic, Vietnam began easing its nationwide lockdown Thursday following an aggressive containment campaign that has meant few infections and no deaths in an Asian nation initially believed to be at great risk from the coronavirus.\nThe communist-ruled country has sealed its borders, quarantined masses of people, used soldiers and police to track down potential infections and fined social media users for spreading misinformation. After deploying the full arsenal of a single-party state, the sprawling nation of 95 million people has now gone a full week without recording a new infection.\nBut despite their effectiveness, Vietnam's measures are not easily replicable. Its intolerance of dissent and ability to mobilize an entire security and political apparatus - steps more common in China - meant its campaign met little of the pushback seen in Western liberal democracies.\nAnd experts caution that the fight isn't over. Starting Thursday, Vietnam allowed residents across the country to resume small gatherings and restarted buses, taxis and regular domestic flights for the first time in three weeks. But with much of Southeast Asia still under lockdown, people must continue wearing masks in public, gatherings of more than 20 remain off-limits, schools will stay closed for several more weeks and international flights are still grounded, officials said.\n\"Many parts of the world are still infected, so the risk is not over for us,\" Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said this week.\nSince the government imposed a partial nationwide lockdown April 1, Vietnam saw only a modest increase in coronavirus cases to 268, with all but 44 recovered and no fatalities.\nThe numbers are stunningly low considering that Vietnam - which shares a border with China - was among the first countries where the virus spread and lacks the resources of governments more celebrated for their containment strategies, such as South Korea's widespread testing and Taiwan's aggressive digital surveillance.\nIts results stand out even more as other Southeast Asian countries struggle. Wealthy Singapore, once regarded as a model, has seen infections skyrocket among migrant workers living in overcrowded dormitories. Indonesia, the largest country in the region, initially ignored the threat and now has the most COVID-19 deaths in Asia after China.\n\"It's pretty amazing,\" said Huong Le Thu, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. \"I'm cautious of calling Vietnam a success story. It's too early to be out of the woods. But the measures have been quite effective so far.\"\nExperts credit Vietnam's early, decisive steps: swiftly banning nearly all travel from China, suspending schools in mid-January even before recording any infections, quarantining tens of thousands of people and employing the extensive Communist Party apparatus to communicate distancing measures and trace the contacts of COVID-19 patients.\nThe response was made possible by a Leninist one-party system that is often criticized for maintaining secrecy, silencing dissent and trampling on individual rights - but that has proven adept at tackling health crises since it was the first nation to stamp out the SARS epidemic nearly two decades ago.\n\"Only a few countries can control and mobilize resources on this scale,\" said Le Hong Hiep, a Vietnam analyst at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. \"In Vietnam they can do it, and partly because of a political system that's designed to respond to such situations. It's not always good, but in a crisis it helps.\"\nThe sweeping measures often led to large numbers of people being isolated over just a handful of infections.\nIn February, when a group of Vietnamese workers tested positive for the virus after returning from Wuhan, the Chinese city that was the source of the outbreak, authorities locked down their entire commune of 10,000 people for three weeks - the first mass quarantine outside China.\nLast month, more than 300 medical staff, police, soldiers and civilians were deployed to track down the contacts of a British pilot believed to be the origin of a coronavirus cluster at a bar in Ho Chi Minh City. Authorities sealed off several businesses and quarantined thousands of people in their apartments.\nIn recent weeks, as imported infections surged across Asia, Vietnam placed tens of thousands of incoming travelers - whether they showed COVID-19 symptoms or not - in quarantine at army barracks, university dorms and other public facilities.\nAs precautionary steps, they were aggressive, perhaps overly so. But they kept pressure off of Vietnam's hospitals and allowed contact tracers to focus on a relatively small number of clusters.\n\"What we know now is this virus spreads from pre-symptomatic people, and if you're only monitoring people when they get symptoms it's too late,\" said Todd Pollack, a Harvard Medical School infectious disease specialist who leads a health initiative in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi.\nAmerican officials have been struck by Vietnam's low infection rate. Experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Vietnam - who have provided assistance in testing, data analysis and contact tracing - say they \"don't have any indication that those numbers are false,\" Dr. John MacArthur, the center's director in Thailand, said on a conference call with reporters last week.\nThis week, state media reported that tests of more than 1,000 shoppers in Hanoi markets and more than 19,000 travelers at airports and train stations in Ho Chi Minh City found no infections, bolstering the belief that the outbreak has been contained.\nIts success has allowed Vietnam to begin playing the role of benefactor - a subtle challenge to its sometime rival China - donating hundreds of thousands of masks to Europe and its Southeast Asian neighbors.\nThis month Hanoi expedited the shipment to the U.S. of nearly half a million protective medical suits manufactured at a DuPont factory in Vietnam, earning a thank-you tweet from President Trump.\nThis morning, 450,000 protective suits landed in Dallas, Texas. This was made possible because of the partnership of two great American companies-DuPont and FedEx-and our friends in Vietnam. Thank you! @DuPont_News @FedEx pic.twitter.com/8yhG6tYnQW\n- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2020\nAnalysts say Vietnam's turbulent relationship with China influenced its response to the outbreak. Days after China reported the first death from the virus Jan. 11 - and before any cases had surfaced in Vietnam - the health ministry held a high-level meeting with U.S. and World Health Organization officials to lay out a containment plan.\nAt the core of Vietnam's concern was the suspicion \"that the scale of the outbreak was much higher than what is officially reported by China,\" Le said. That skepticism turned out to be well founded as China was accused of suppressing initial reports about how fast the virus was spreading.\nThis week, the U.S. cybersecurity company FireEye reported that hackers linked to the Vietnamese government had attempted to break into the email accounts of Chinese emergency management officials and authorities in Wuhan beginning in January - ostensibly to learn more about the outbreak.\n\"Vietnam understands China better than some other countries,\" Le said. \"Because of the similar political systems, they know how China works, and they know the risks and downsides of such systems. They know there may be problems in China's data. So in dealing with China, Vietnam is very cautious.\"",

        "content": "With the spread of the corona virus, uncertainty is increasing for the Chinese economy and thus the global economy and financial markets. The brewing Chinese recovery is likely to take a hit in the short term and GDP could be reduced by up to one percentage point in H1. The virus is at an early stage and it is difficult to judge how much it can spread before it gets under control. On the positive side, the government response has been faster and more drastic measures have been taken to contain the virus compared to the SARS epidemic in 2002-03. On the other hand, the virus seems more contagious than SARS and China\u2019s transport system is significantly wider today. The Chinese New Year holiday that started last week poses a heightened risk of contagion. The economic impact is likely to be bigger this time as the service economy is a much higher share (54%) of the economy today compared with the 2002-03 SARS outbreak (42%). The Chinese economy is also a much bigger driver of global growth. A mitigating factor is that mainly the service sector should be hit, where the import content is small. However, retail sales could also suffer, which could hurt imports and inflation could see another push higher from reduced production in Hubel. The SARS epidemic lasted 3-4 months but it is hard to say if this is any guide. While the government response is faster, the new virus seems to be spreading faster. It is too early to judge when it will get under control. How fast is the virus spreading?\nAs of Monday morning 27 January the number of infected people has increased to 2,796 up from around 200 cases one week ago. 80 people have now died up from three a week ago. The virus has spread to all but one of China\u2019s 31 provinces. The virus has also been registered in 11 other countries, which have reported a total of 40 cases with Thailand being hit the most with eight cases, while five cases have been registered in the US.\nAt a press conference on Sunday China\u2019s top health official said the virus\u2019s transmission ability is getting stronger and that it also spreads during incubation time. It means a person can transmit the virus before any symptoms have shown up. It makes screening at airports etc. less effective. It also came out on Sunday that as much as 5 million people had already left Wuhan, the centre of the virus, before the lockdown started on Thursday last week. Wuhan is a major transportation hub with 700,000 passengers normally passing through three stations. Some concerning stories circulate from Wuhan about people with symptoms that stay home out of fear of getting more sick at the crowded hospitals.How does it compare with the SARS virus in 2003?\nThe SARS virus continued to spread for 3-4 months in the beginning of 2003 before it got under control. Around 8,000 people were registered and 770 people died. Hence, it seems the mortality rate was higher than with the current virus. SARS was first registered in November 2002 in the Guangdong province but China did not report it to WHO until 10 February 2003, when 305 cases were reported and five people had died. The virus spread to many Asian countries and Canada was also hit with 44 people dying from the virus. The virus peaked around May and WHO declared the outbreak contained in early July.\nCompared to 2003 the authorities have responded much quicker and taken more drastic measures to stop the spread. China has expanded the number of cities in lockdown now covering a population of 56 million people. Cultural sites such as the Forbidden City and parts of the Great Wall have been closed and movie theatres have also shut in many cities. China is building two new hospitals in Wuhan city, which are set to be ready within weeks. A leading group has been set up under the Standing Committee of the Politburo (the leadership of China) with the responsibility of leading the fight against the virus. Premier Li Keqiang will be heading the efforts to fight the virus, which means decision power will be strong compared to if decisions had to be taken at a lower level.\nHowever, while the response is quicker the risk of contagion is higher today due to the much wider transportation network with a huge amount of trains, flights and cars compared to 2003. Around 50 trains per day were leaving from Wuhan to the big cities in China until the city was put in lockdown. The virus is also spreading at a critical point in time as people left last week for the Chinese New Year celebration on Friday last week. It is a time of year when typically 3-400 million people travel to reunite with their family. Finally, the virus is more contagious this time as it can also be transmitted during incubation time. How will it affect the economy this time?\nDuring the SARS outbreak retail sales took a hit but overall growth was not affected much. However, the economic impact is likely to be bigger this time. The service sector is likely to take the main hit and is much bigger today (54% of GDP) than in 2003 (42% of GDP). People will stay home from movie theatres, concerts, restaurants and reduce travelling. China\u2019s middle class is much bigger today and typically spends more on entertainment than low-income groups. Retail sales took a hit in 2003 with annual growth falling from 10% to 4.5% at the peak of the crisis. People stayed home from markets and shopping streets to avoid contagion. A similar effect is likely today, although it is likely to be mitigated by a much wider degree of online sales. The consumer sector has already been hit from higher food prices due to the African swine fever that has pushed up inflation and eroded purchasing power. The lockdown of pretty much all of the Hubei province will likely add to the upward inflation pressure. The Hubei province is likely to see a significant drop in GDP due to the lockdown. Hubei is 4% of China\u2019s overall economy, so a 20% drop in GDP could subtract 0.8 percentage points from China\u2019s GDP, all else equal. The New Year holiday is set to be extended for another week in several areas, which will lead to a direct reduction in output in the short term. Finally, the virus hits at a time when the economy is already fragile due to lingering effects from the trade war. The rising uncertainty could once again put investments on the backburner until it is clear how serious the effects from the virus will be.\nOn the positive side, the Hubei province is a smaller part of the Chinese economy than during SARS when Guangdong was the centre of the virus. Guangdong is China\u2019s biggest province with more than 100 million people and 11% of China\u2019s GDP.\nThe Chinese government will likely aim to mitigate the negative impact through some stimulus. However, it is more difficult to counter the drag on GDP, as it is partly due to a supply shock that hits production in one province. The likely temporary nature of the shock also makes it difficult to calibrate how much to ease and for how long. However, we do expect some kind of response at least to underpin sentiment and monetary stimulus as well as possible tax cuts could be on the table.\nAt this stage it is very hard to judge to overall impact on the economy, but based on the above factors a hit of around one percentage point could be on the table. It is likely to be a temporary effect and to be compensated by higher growth when the virus has come under control. This was the case with SARS, where retail sales growth for a while was higher than before the virus, as pent-up demand had built up. How much will it affect the global economy?\nChina\u2019s economy is much bigger today than when SARS hit in 2003. The share of the global economy was around 9% in 2003 in PPP-adjusted terms and is 19% today. China is driving around one-third of global growth compared with around 20% in 2003.\nA mitigating factor for the global economy is that the service sector is likely to take the biggest hit and the import content here is much smaller than in the manufacturing sector. The hit to the retail sector will also be felt among foreign companies but many of them produce goods for the Chinese market in China.\nNevertheless, there is likely to be some spill-over, not least due to the higher uncertainty, which hits at a time when sentiment is already low. Hence, there is a clear risk that the expected recovery in growth and PMIs could be somewhat delayed or at least be more muted. As in China, the effect should be temporary, though.\nGlobal financial markets have also started to react with especially the Chinese markets taking a hit. Global bond yields and commodity prices have also moved lower. Given the strong rally in global equity markets in the beginning of the year, there is a risk that early profit taking triggers a correction due to the increasing uncertainty. Conclusion: rising uncertainty as we enter unchartered waters\nWe are in unchartered waters as a virus of this kind has not taken place in the more modern economy that China is today with much wider transport networks and being more integrated with the global economy. A hit to the Chinese economy is inevitable at this stage but we have to wait and see how the virus develops to evaluate how big the hit will be and how long it will last. ",

She is the first cured patient of the novel coronavirus in Bozhou and among the first batch in Anhui. The battle against the 2019 novel coronavirus is a trial of strength between human beings and virus. The Chinese government and Chinese people are rushing to the front line, composing a song of praise for the value of life.\nThe battle is also a test for morality and sense of justice. The international society, with its righteous strength, is joining the battle with China to contain the epidemic, illustrating \u201ca friend in need is a friend indeed\u201d with concrete actions and playing a symphony of the community with a shared future for mankind.\nHowever, certain western country, with exaggerated response, has crossed the bottom line of morality and started the daydreaming of kicking China down in the tribulation to seek their own private profits.\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday, February 3, at the 146th session of the WHO Executive Board meeting that protection is necessary, but there\u2019s no need to overreact.\nWHO is not recommending measures that \u201cunnecessarily interfere with travel and commerce\u201d, the WHO chief said, calling on all countries to implement decisions that are \u201cevidence-based and consistent\u201d.\nHe explained from a professional perspective that what should be done and what shouldn\u2019t, telling people not to panic.\nDeputies from dozens of countries to the meeting hailed that China\u2019s prevention and control measures have set an example, saying they are willing to join the battle with the Chinese people.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that the spreading of panic is more horrible than the spreading of virus, and only confidence is the way out.\nAccording to media reports, the A/H1N1 swine flu that started in the U.S. in 2009 caused over 1.63 million infection cases and led to 284,500 deaths, leaving a fatality rate of 17.4 percent. Thanks to the unremitted efforts made by China, the fatality rate of the novel coronavirus has been restricted at around 2.1 percent in the country, much lower than usual. Starting from Feb. 1, the number of cured cases has outrun that of the death cases, which indicates that the epidemic is totally controllable.\nHowever, just after WHO said there\u2019s no reason to unnecessarily interfere with international travel and said it doesn\u2019t recommend and actually opposes any restrictions for travel or other measures against China, the US took the initiative to announce a highest-level warning on not to travel to China, banning US citizens from going to China, as well as the entry into the US by any foreign national who has traveled to China in the past 14 days.\nThe US was the first to evacuate personnel from its consulate in Wuhan, the first to suggest partial withdrawal of its embassy staff, and the first to impose a travel ban on Chinese travelers.\nThe US practices are obviously in lack of science- and fact-based foundation, and even officials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security believe that the epidemic has generally low risk for US citizens.\nRelevant US experts said that the US is turning from overconfidence to fear and overreaction, pointing out such decision is not backed by science, and they suggest early cancellation.\nThe epidemic is a public enemy of the world, in which sympathy and justice shall never be absent. However, when the international community is joining hands to combat the virus, some U.S. politicians are busy making private political gains. What they have done has crossed the bottom line of human civilization.\nUS Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said publicly that the coronavirus outbreak in China will help accelerate the return of jobs to America, and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brazenly made mischief between China and its neighboring countries in name of the novel coronavirus outbreak during his trip to Central Asia in recent days. What\u2019s more, US Senator Tom Cotton has been repeatedly slandering China, clamoring for a ban on the country and suggesting all Americans escape from the country.\nSuch ridiculous remarks by US politicians are both ugly and ignorant. Many Americans have said bluntly on the Internet that Cotton\u2019s remarks are even more dangerous than the novel coronavirus.\nWhether a country should lend a hand or give a stab in the back in the face of epidemic is a question about the value of justice. It\u2019s believed that the power of understanding, sympathy, support and unity will always be the mainstream as conscience and justice will always be there.\nCountries and international organizations are actively preparing and sending medical supplies to China, and many friendly people are also supporting China\u2019s efforts in various ways. The supports for China and Wuhan come from all over the world, a beautiful moment in the human society where the destiny of each party is closely knitted. Both material and moral supports carry the positive energy in helping the world get through the current difficulties.\nIn the face of epidemic, there will always be a ruler that measures morality of international community.",

        "content": "In December 2019 the Chinese authorities detected a novel coronavirus in Wuhan City, Hubei Province. The virus, now known as 2019-nCov, has already infected over 28,000 and killed more than 560 people.\nThe severity of the outbreak of nCov-2019 has increased with the number of confirmed cases of infection.\nLikewise, the likely economic impact has become more significant with the extension of measures take to contain the virus, Qatar National Bank (QNB) said in its weekly economic report.\n\u201cWe do not yet know whether it will take weeks or months to bring the virus under control. However, the simple scenarios and calculations presented here tell us that nCov-2019 may have already halved the pick-up in global growth in 2020 and there could be no pick up,\u201d the report noted.\nLast week QNB had highlighted the likely drag on economic growth in emerging Asia, primarily via a hit to tourism. However, the virus is spreading quickly and the number of newly confirmed cases is continuing to rise, particularly in China.\nThis week, QNB\u2019s economic report takes a closer look at the virus and focus on quantifying the direct impact of weaker Chinese GDP growth on global GDP growth.\nAutomotive and energy demand will be hit\nChinese automotive sales are set to fall by 25 percent to 30 percent in the first two months of 2020, with the virus likely to drag down China\u2019s full-year auto sales by as much as 5 percent. Likewise, Chinese car production is forecast to fall by 15 percent during Q1.\nChina is the world largest importer of crude oil and second largest importer of LNG. Oil imports are estimated to have fallen by 25 percent already, which will reduce fuel production by refineries and delay crude shipments. Similarly, lower gas demand is prompting Chinese gas buyers to consider reducing import volumes, given already high inventories.\n2020 Chinese GDP growth will now be weaker\nIt is worth noting that it is the measures to contain the virus, particularly the travel bans and extended factory shutdowns, that are causing almost all of the economic damage rather than the virus itself.\nQNB expects Chinese GDP to be 2 percentage points (ppt) weaker in Q1 2020, down to 4 percent year-on-year from 6 percent in Q4 2019. But a recovery from Q2 onwards would limit the impact on full-year GDP growth to less than 1 ppt. The full-year impact could easily be twice as large in a more severe scenario if travel restrictions and shutdowns extend into Q2.\nChina is now large enough to impact Global GDP\nChina now accounts for around 20 percent of the global economy at purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates. Therefore, a 1 ppt fall in Chinese GDP growth (QNB\u2019s base case) would knock 0.2 ppt off of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\u2019s projection of 3.3 percent global GDP growth in 2020. Further, our more severe scenario would knock 0.4 ppt off of global GDP, lowering it to only 2.9 percent in 2020 and wiping out all of the expected pick-up in growth from 2.9 percent in 2019.\nThose simple calculations ignore the indirect negative impact on GDP in other countries via tourism, supply chain disruption, and weaker Chinese demand for commodities. However, they also ignore the positive impact on GDP from policy stimulus (both fiscal and monetary) China and other countries.\nWe expect these impacts to offset each other, making the simple calculations a good starting point for assessing the potential impact.\nAggressive measures taken to contain the virus\nIn response to the increasing severity of the outbreak, authorities in China have implement travel bans, quarantines, and closures of factories and leisure facilities. The decision to quarantine the whole of Wuhan City from January 23 is important because 2019-nCov has an incubation period of up to 14 days and it will take this long for us to start to see a reduction in the rate of newly confirmed cases.\nTravel restrictions led to a fall in passengers within China during the Lunar New Year holiday of up to 50 percent across road, rail and air transport.\nFactory and business shutdowns have been imposed on 14 provinces and cities across China, including the main industrial centre. Together, they account for 70 percent of China\u2019s GDP and 80 percent of exports. With the virus continuing to spread, it is likely the shutdowns will be extended beyond February 10.\nSARS was more deadly but less infectious\nThe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002-2003 infected nearly 9,000 people in 17 countries and killed around 10 percent of those infected. In comparison, 2019-nCoV has already infected more people than SARS, but appears to have a much lower mortality rate, only killing 2-3 percent of those infected so far. Normal seasonal flu is another relevant comparison. 2017/18 was a bad flu season in the US with 45 million people displaying symptoms but only 61,000 flu-related deaths, which is only 0.14 percent of those infected.",

Luna General Hospital) in Quezon City for possible case of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD), a military health official revealed on Sunday.\nCaptain Sherwin Joseph Sarmiento, spokesperson of the Health Service Command of the AFP-Public Affairs Office (PAO), confirmed that they were keeping an eye on an undisclosed number of persons under monitoring (PUM) and persons under investigation (PUI) isolated at the infection ward of the military healthcare facility.\nSarmiento refused to divulge the exact number of PUMs and PUIs being assessed citing the principle of confidentiality and data privacy.\n\u201cPUMs are the ones with travel history in countries that the Department of Health says: China, Hong Kong and Macau (The PUMs are those with travel history to China, Hong Kong and Macau as advised by the Department of Health [DOH]), \u201dSarmiento said in a radio interview over dzBB, referring to countries where the government implemented a travel ban.\n\u201cPUI patients are patients with a history of travel at the same time, with symptoms such as cough, cold, fever, sore throat, and shortness of breath (The PUIs, on the other hand, are patients who have a travel history there and at the same time, were exhibiting symptoms like cough, colds, fever, throat irritation and difficulty in breathing), \u201dhe added.\nThe V. Luna General Hospital is tasked to provide medical care to military and civilian personnel of the AFP, including their immediate dependents, when the nCov outbreak happened in Wuhan, China.\nIn the Philippines, the first confirmed nCoV case was noted on January 30, 2020 \u2014 a 38-year-old Chinese woman who arrived from Wuhan. As of Saturday, the Department of Health said there were three confirmed nCoV cases in the country including one fatality, the male companion of the woman.\n\u201cKapag po kasi exposure ang pinag-uusapan, ultimo mga kasama sa bahay.

Even the relatives who were exposed to the military are being quarantined or assessed),\u201d Sarmiento said.\nSarmiento, who is a doctor, allayed fears by other patients admitted at V. Luna Hospital since the PUMs and PUIs were quarantined in a building separate from the main hospital.\nThe infection ward was previously being used to treat soldiers and their dependents with tuberculosis, measles and other multi-drug resistant diseases.\nHowever, it has since been cleared and transformed to a quarantine area for military personnel and their dependents who are suspected to have acquired the deadly respiratory disease.\nREAD MORE: DOH: nCoV PUIs now at 264\nNOTE Case count in this article does not include the sick nurses from yesterday.\nStill in this feeling of dissonance. Am I going crazy? Is the media gaslighting me? One angle the news is just so insane but presenting a lot of facts, and the actions of the gov are one of panic. On the other hand, we are being told that it is not so bad blah blah.\nOn one hand those in the know, KNOW for a fact that the gov will lie when the news is this bad. It is another thing to actually see this in action.\n",

        "content": "Corona Virus Affects Offset Record Q1 iPhone and Portable Sales Apple: Corona Virus Affects Offset Record Q1 iPhone and Portable Sales Google +\nApple's CEO Tim Cook and Apple's CFO Luca Maestri reported in a conference call with financial analysts about new record earnings of $ 91.8 billion for the Christmas quarter. Strongest point in its history, measured in dollars and devices. However, the potential impact of the corona virus, which is spreading in China, has a significant negative impact on the company's leadership.\nCook and Maestri emphasized that there are currently 1.5 billion active Apple devices. Quarterly increase of 100 million, with customer satisfaction of 98% for all three iPhone 11 models. Cook found that the iPhone 11 was Apple's best-selling model at $ 699 a week every quarter, and all three 1 1-series phones were the company's top seller. 5G is \"in its infancy\" without confirming that it was preparing to release devices. Regardless, he said, \"We couldn't be more proud of our line-up and wouldn't trade our position for anyone,\" and subtly underlined the continued strong performance of iPhones in most markets, despite the lack of 5G support. In response to another question, Cook noted that 5G adoption is not going to be the same in all regions, suggesting that this company may be pursuing regionally different strategies for its devices this year.\nThe iPhone grew as the year progressed, and smaller wearables and services companies saw stronger percentage jumps, each about $ 2 billion higher than the previous numbers. The Wearables category alone is now the size of a Fortune 150 company and sets a new sales record in almost every market Apple is pursuing around the world. Over 75% of customers shopping during the quarter were new to Apple Watch. Cook confirmed that both the $ 199 Apple Watch Series 3 and the $ 249 AirPods Pro are currently limited in offer. This means that the demand for each product is higher than the company can keep up with.\nHowever, the company is concerned about the potential impact of China's Wuhan coronavirus on its production and sales. Maestri and Cook said the company not only offered a wide range of revenue estimates ($ 63 billion to $ 67 billion) for the coming quarter due to the risks associated with the virus, but that the company was experiencing problems has already closed a retail store in China and is actively cleaning other stores to protect them for guests. In addition, the device production, which was to resume after the New Year, was postponed slightly to the second week of February.\nPartly thanks to the growing size of the installed device base, service revenue increased 17%. Last year, Cook saw double-digit growth in all five regions and in all services offered by Apple. The App Store had a particularly strong December and a new record of $ 386 million on New Year's Day alone. However, the company didn't have any difficult numbers for Apple TV +, Apple Arcade, or Apple News +, suggesting that subscriber numbers are increasing. Not surprisingly, Apple Pay revenue has increased and transactions have more than doubled year on year.\nOn the computer front, while iPad and Mac numbers fell slightly year-on-year, Maestri referred to them as Cook, noting that the iPad was growing in emerging markets. The comparison between iPad and Mac compared to the previous year was \u201cdifficult\u201d, said Maestri, since important new models were introduced in the previous year's quarter, although Cook used the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, the modular Mac Pro and the new MacBook Pro as models designated Pro Display XDR, which was released during the quarter, was very well received by the professional creative community.",

Do e-mail me, I like people! Hi. Doctors and Professors, talk to me. Sunday, 2 February 2020 Cure Corona totally, no pills Ultrasound\u2014Cancer Cure: Cheap Home Cure to All Cancers Price: \u00a313.41 (excl. VAT) Prints in 3-5 business days Ultrasound\u2014Cancer Cure explores a perspective and revolutionary new treatment for cancer: high-intensity ultrasound, a noninvasive but promising new treatment that is being studied as a way to treat all cancers and could even cure in just one application. Author Dr. Jon Thomason shares research from the Moffitt Cancer Center, which pioneered research into this application of ultrasound, and he explains both how ultrasound works and how, more importantly, it can be used to as a treatment for cancer. Chemotherapy and surgery are not the only options for patients suffering from cancer. Ultrasound is a promising new alternative that could offer a noninvasive treatment without the debilitating side-effects of radiation and surgery. Certificate of registration The US library of congress has just registered 'Ultrasound \u2013 Cheap Home Cure To All Cancers' TX 8-659-428 Add to Basket 2002 and three medical professors at the Moffitt cancer centre, published the use of High Intensity UltraSound to totally clear cancer at one session. Global doctors confirmed the same week, it works for all 200 cancers out there!They were then legally a medically constrained from ever prescribing cancer drugs again. Biochemical treatments and chemotherapy, plus radio therapy and surgery, lead inevitably to a patient's two year decline to death. And expensive agonising death.This is criminal medicine! Striking off the Dr. the first day they prescribed cancer drugs. As they were all under the legal imperative, to personally validate the Moffitt paper.They all had to acquire a HIUS device, and verified it works for all cancers. Which are forced to divide in a single cell viral fashion. Regular body cells never divide a multiply!This was actually covered in the Moffitt Paper. High us had to cure all viral infections. Major investigation revealed it also clears all bacterial infections. Which also an inflated cell structure, to induce the human immune system to copy the bacterial genome. And give it a minimal cell wall.2012 my personal contact in New York, verified \u00bd minute of HIUS to each side the chest totally clears he HIV AIDs. I've published my work freely on the Internet.Subsequent prescription of all AIDs medication, was medical malpractice. Striking off the Dr., Hospital, nurses, pharmacists and hospitals. So eight was totally cured 2012. 2020, medics talk as if AIDs treatments were defective medicine.They are really a 10 year biochemical death sentence. There prescription medical malpractice. He will have acquired and used a HIUS device at home. An 8 W 1 MHz ultrasound massage device, is an effective home HIUS device.Medically licensed for safe, unsupervised and home use. Clearing all AIDs in just 1 minute.So all cancers cured 2002. Subsequent cancer drug prescription striking off all involved medical staff. Who pay a fine of 10,000,000 UK pounds, for each patient medicated to death.2012 both AIDs and coronary heart disease were cleared. \u00bd minute of HIUS to the top left to the chest and at the back to the kidneys, clears coronary heart disease. 1 minute to the top left to the chest clears obstructive heart disease.2013 I validated \u00bd minute of HIUS to the bottom right of the chest over the pancreas, cleared type two diabetes. All over the world! 1 minute of HIUS clears type one diabetes instantly. Otherwise the diabetes only remits in three days, as the immune system clears the viral structure causing diabetes.2012 and we have the Corona virus. How? Every registered Dr. on earth has personally validated HIUS clears all viruses and cancers. Prescribing biochemical treatments for viruses is criminal medicine.For the doctors have a HIUS device in the nursing office. Doctors resist using it! Reasoning $50,000, two years and only 250,000 avoidable patient deaths, will lead to a biochemical treatment for a virus.Which has been totally curable totally with 1 minute of HIUS, as medically published 2002. The doctors in Wuhan China, have all validated HIUS clears all cancers. And have a suitable ultrasound device.That HIUS also clears all viruses in 1 minute! Just \u00bd minute to each side the chest will totally clear Corona. No Dr. Intervention required!You can buy a suitable 8 W 1 MHz device over the Internet. There and every Dr. On earth already owns the device! In a case of 8 W 3 MHZ. You can apply it freely two every patient who calls into a doctor's surgery, and he will do no harm to people without a virus. \u00a39.90 + \u00a32.99 P&P If they do have any virus, it will be cleared!

Any traveller returning from countries at risk of coronavirus must carry out a self-diagnosis before entering Mozambique,\u201d Cuco advised.\nA Mozambique student in China is suspected to be carrying the virus and has reportedly been prevented from leaving the Chinese city where he is spending the holidays.\nAuthorities said this was a precautionary measure.\nTanzania issued a stern statement against members of the public overlooking suspected cases of the virus.\n\u201cThe ministry warns the public on this,\u201d said the Ministry of Health spokesperson, Gerald Chami.\nMinister Ummy Mwalimu\u2019s health ministry stated it would boost airport surveillance for passengers travelling from China and other affected countries.\nTanzania has embarked on an awareness drive among health workers and health workers, with a major focus on entry points.\nQuarantine facilities are being considered.\nDespite WHO classifying Zambia as a low risk country, the government has boosted surveillance of the killer disease at entry points across the country, mainly airports.\nChilufya, the Minister of Health, confirmed the proceedings.\nThe use of thermal scanners for temperature monitoring on all arrival passengers is some of the measures.\nChilufya National Public Health Emergency Operations Centre was on high alert.\n\u201cThe government under is committed to addressing this challenge,\u201d the minister said.\nAlready, Zambia is at risk of the world\u2019s second worst outbreak of Ebola that has claimed the lives of more than 2 200 people since August 2018 in the northern neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo .\nMalawi has also set up screening procedures for people arriving from overseas.\nCoronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. They can be spread from human to human.\nAmong the most deadly in recent years are the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).\nAn outbreak of SARS, which also started in China in 2002, resulted in more than 700 deaths globally.\nSince 2012, 850 deaths have been documented from MERS.",

This was revealed by the International Race Federation (FIA) after receiving input from the Bamboo Curtain Country promoters.\n\"The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the corona virus to be a global health emergency. \"The FIA \u200b\u200band Formula 1 have taken the decision to postpone the race for the health and safety of the staff, championship participants and fans,\" the FIA \u200b\u200bstatement was quoted as saying by Sky Sports.\nInitially the Chinese GP was scheduled to take place on the 19th April 2020. Until now the latest schedule has not been released by the parties concerned. That way, there is a fairly long gap from the Vietnam GP (5 April 2020) to the Dutch GP (3 May 2020).\n\"All parties will choose the right time to determine an alternative race date. The Chinese GP has long been an important part of the F1 calendar because many of our fans are there, \"the FIA \u200b\u200bstatement said.\n\"The F1 FIA community hopes that the race in China can be held as soon as possible. We also pray that the people there can face difficult times like this. \"\nBesides F1, there are many other sports agendas that cancel their activities in the Bamboo Curtain country.

        "content": "For fun we\u2019re going to use some logic as it relates to the Corona Virus in China. Instead of fear mongering, we think the USA will probably be in good shape, that said if we look at the numbers the other countries near Asia do not make sense. There is a wide range of opinions including people who think its the black plague (not even close) and people who think it should be compared to the common flu (no ability to understand statistics). We\u2019ll attempt to put some numbers and predictions around this.\nHigh-Level: From a top down view you can assume that it is a pretty deadly disease. Not because of the current numbers (35,000 confirmed and 725 deaths) but because of the precautions that have been taken. When the US was attacked in Baghdad they didn\u2019t bother flying the US leaders out. Yet\u2026 We\u2019re evacuating important people located in China. Add to this the fact that China has locked down ~400M people (at least attempting to keep it locked down) which is more than the population of the USA and Canada combined. Even during the SARS outbreak the level of restrictions was not this high.\nWe can make a few conclusions, the severity of the disease is 100x+ higher than any foolish comparison to the flu. You\u2019ll get the flu at least a few times during your life and the chances of dying are in the basis points (less if you\u2019re under the age of 60 or so). This new virus has a death rate of about 2%+ and you have to add in bodies that were found before they could be tested. Therefore an easy conclusion here is that this is a serious illness that is not currently contained. We can prove out that it is not currently contained because of the rapid growth. Therefore, conclusion number 1 is that this is a serious infection.\nCurrent Numbers: The second item to be aware of is the growth of confirmed cases. It appears to be growing at a 10% rate or so per day. This is likely an understated number since it is reaching a point where testing this many people has a lot of errors in it . If you live in a major city, imagine trying to take 20,000 of them and test them all in a day or two. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense and we know China is certainly understating the number. The more important number to track is actually the number of cases outside of Hubei. Only a few weeks ago most cases were largely contained in that particular province but now we\u2019re looking at 25,000 people (according to the latest data) which results in 10,000 total cases outside of the primary infection point.\nYou can manually track places outside of Hubei with this website.\nSo what should you actually track? You should really track numbers in areas like Thailand, Mongolia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Cambodia. Why? Well these countries have extremely low \u201ccases\u201d despite being popular areas to visit and quite close to China. It\u2019s extremely unlikely that Singapore with 33 confirmed cases and Thailand with only 32 makes a lot of sense. There is a lot more traffic from Wuhan to Thailand. Instead if you are in Singapore you should be happy about the higher number of confirmed cases because it means your government has adequate technology to lock down and test everyone coming in. Another great example is actually Japan, while people are scared of the number of cases found on the cruise ship, you can conclude that they are taking the right measures and have adequate testing to prevent a rapid outbreak. Just take a look below.\nIf you look at the rough numbers from the table, why would Thailand have an equal number of cases relative to Singapore? It doesn\u2019t make a lot of logical sense. And. The ability to simply go to Thailand is easy (without the flight data) so the chances that Thailand is behind the correct number is high. We\u2019d wager that Thailand will end up being one of the countries with a mini outbreak at this time. The fact that Australia has half as many cases as Thailand should be another clear indicator that they are behind. And. We\u2019ll add that Mongolia having zero cases is questionable given the close location.\nSome Good News: If you\u2019re in the USA, Europe\u2026 even Korea, Japan and Singapore, you\u2019re pretty much good to go. The chances of having a mass outbreak in an advanced country is low. Advanced countries will be able to correctly identify the right people and increase safety for the general public. We\u2019d be extremely surprised to see an outbreak in a major US city. Within a month or so we think the issues in Japan/Korea/Singapore will be solved /contained. The real issue appears to be in the third world countries that are located near China. The second piece of good news is that you really shouldn\u2019t cancel any \u201cflights\u201d to an area outside of Asia. The virus does not live long on seats. You simply want to avoid going to China for a while and avoid the third world Asian countries as an extra precautionary measure.\nCurrent Predictions: This wouldn\u2019t be fun if we didn\u2019t put out some predictions on the issue. The first one is that the total outbreak number will certainly exceed 100,000+ at some point. That is pretty likely given the spread to low-tech third world countries. The second one is that China will not solve the issue in \u201c14 days\u201d. We think the chances of a 14 day slow down is next to none. This likely goes on past the month of February at a minimum and into March. By the time that the issue is contained we would then add another 4-6 months before tourism goes back to normal. It is unlikely that people suddenly decide to go back to China after something this large occurs, particularly if the infected cases clears 100K.\nOn the positive side of things, we think this will probably peak in about a month. This means the major countries will have it contained. No major outbreaks in Singapore, USA, Europe, Australia, Japan or Taiwan. This is not going to last forever that\u2019s for sure and we won\u2019t be hearing about it by the end of the year (if we do it was a catastrophe). As a rough estimate we\u2019ll go ahead and wager that the mortality/death rate will be around 2%, it seems to be stabilizing in this area and since most numbers are fudged it means 3% is more likely. This is a pretty serious issue for diseases for those that looked up mortality rates of other viruses.\nSome Conclusions: The first conclusion is to certainly avoid Asia for a bit if you planned on going. If you must go certainly avoid China (for now at least). It isn\u2019t worth the risk for a 2% death rate. The second conclusion is that panicking in the USA is a bit humorous, you\u2019re not going to do much with a face mask. The size of the disease particles is actually smaller than the protective mask can prevent (yes we looked this all up). You might accidentally increase your chances of getting it since the particles can stick to the mask as you inhale.\nIf you want to be extra careful, you can reduce your travel to the regions near China as well but we\u2019d wager that the major countries will have things under control. If you want to track it more seriously, we would look at every third world country and province outside if Hubei. That\u2019s the major issue at this time as no one in their right mind is flying into Wuhan. Hopefully, this came out as somewhat balanced, we can\u2019t believe the headlines that this is similar to the flu. We\u2019ve seen too many media headlines trying to say \u201cnot a big deal\u201d which is the exact opposite of what they did during the financial crisis. So it\u2019s best to assume it\u2019s worse than mainstream media, worse than Chinese media and *better* than hysteria in the USA/abroad. The face mask business in the USA is booming for no reason (if you\u2019re in the face mask business congrats on the extra sales!)\nYes our Q&A will take place tomorrow for product purchasers only thanks!",

Abstract Full Text Info/History Metrics Preview PDF\nAbstract A novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December of 2019. This new coronavirus has resulted in thousands of cases of lethal disease in China, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public database and the state-of-the-art single-cell RNA-Seq technique, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the normal human lungs. The result indicates that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). Surprisingly, we found that this population of ACE2-expressing AT2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral reproduction and transmission. A comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the Asian male one has an extremely large number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung. This study provides a biological background for the epidemic investigation of the 2019-nCov infection disease, and could be informative for future anti-ACE2 therapeutic strategy development. Severe infection by 2019-nCov could result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis, causing death in approximately 15% of infected individuals 1 , 2 . Once contacted with the human airway, the spike proteins of this virus can associate with the surface receptors of sensitive cells, which mediated the entrance of the virus into target cells for further replication. Recently, Xu et.al., modeled the spike protein to identify the receptor for 2019-nCov, and indicated that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) could be the receptor for this virus 3 . ACE2 is previously known as the receptor for SARS-Cov and NL63 4 \u2013 6 . According to their modeling, although the binding strength between 2019-nCov and ACE2 is weaker than that between SARS-Cov and ACE2, it is still much higher than the threshold required for virus infection. Zhou et. al. conducted virus infectivity studies and showed that ACE2 is essential for 2019-nCov to enter HeLa cells 7 . These data indicated that ACE2 is likely to be the receptor for 2019-nCov. The expression and distribution of the receptor decide the route of virus infection and the route of infection has a major implication for understanding the pathogenesis and designing therapeutic strategies. Previous studies have investigated the RNA expression of ACE2 in 72 human tissues 8 . However, the lung is a complex organ with multiple types of cells, and such real-time PCR RNA profiling is based on bulk tissue analysis with no way to elucidate the ACE2 expression in each type of cell in the human lung. The ACE2 protein level is also investigated by immunostaining in lung and other organs 8 , 9 . These studies showed that in normal human lung, ACE2 is mainly expressed by type II and type I alveolar epithelial cells. Endothelial cells were also reported to be ACE2 positive. However, immunostaining analysis is known for its lack of signal specificity, and accurate quantification is also another challenge for such analysis. The recently developed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technology enables us to study the ACE2 expression in each cell type and give quantitative information at single-cell resolution. Previous work has built up the online database for scRNA-Seq analysis of 8 normal human lung transplant donors 10 . In current work, we used the updated bioinformatics tools to analyze the data. In total, we analyzed 43,134 cells derived from normal lung tissue of 8 adult donors. We performed unsupervised graph-based clustering (Seurat version 2.3.4) and for each individual, we identified 8~11 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters based on their marker gene expression profile. Typically the clusters include type II alveolar cells (AT2), type I alveolar cells (AT1), airway epithelial cells (ciliated cells and Club cells), fibroblasts, endothelial cells and various types of immune cells. The cell cluster map of a representative donor (Asian male, 55-year-old) was visualized using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) as shown in Fig. 1b and his major cell type marker expressions were demonstrated in Fig.2 .

Next, we analyzed the cell-type-specific expression pattern of ACE2 in each individual. For all donors, ACE2 is expressed in 0.64% of all human lung cells. The majority of the ACE2-expressing cells (averagely 83%) are AT2 cells. Averagely 1.4\u00b10.4% of AT2 cells expressed ACE2. Other ACE2 expressing cells include AT1 cells, airway epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages. However, their ACE2-expressing cell ratio is low and variable among individuals. For the representative donor (Asian male, 55-year-old), the expressions of ACE2 and cell-type-specific markers in each cluster are demonstrated in Fig.2 . To further understand the special population of ACE2-expressing AT2, we performed gene ontology enrichment analysis to study which biological processes are involved with this cell population by comparing them with the AT2 cells not expressing ACE2. Surprisingly, we found that multiple viral process-related GO are significantly over-presented, including \u201cpositive regulation of viral process\u201d (P value=0.001), \u201cviral life cycle\u201d (P value=0.005), \u201cvirion assembly\u201d (P value=0.03) and \u201cpositive regulation of viral genome replication\u201d (P value=0.04). These highly expressed viral process-related genes in ACE2-expressing AT2 include: SLC1A5, CXADR, CAV2, NUP98, CTBP2, GSN,HSPA1B,STOM, RAB1B, HACD3, ITGB6, IST1,NUCKS1,TRIM27, APOE, SMARCB1,UBP1,CHMP1A,NUP160,HSPA8,DAG1,STAU1,ICAM1,CHMP5,D EK, VPS37B, EGFR, CCNK, PPIA, IFITM3, PPIB, TMPRSS2, UBC, LAMP1 and CHMP3. Therefore, it seems that the 2019-nCov has cleverly evolved to hijack this population of AT2 cells for its reproduction and transmission. We further compared the characteristics of the donors and their ACE2 expressing patterns. No association was detected between the ACE2-expressing cell number and the age or smoking status of donors. Of note, the 2 male donors have a higher ACE2-expressing cell ratio than all other 6 female donors (1.66% vs. 0.41% of all cells, P value=0.07, Mann Whitney Test). In addition, the distribution of ACE2 is also more widespread in male donors than females: at least 5 different types of cells in male lung express this receptor, while only 2~4 types of cells in female lung express the receptor. This result is highly consistent with the epidemic investigation showing that most of the confirmed 2019-nCov infected patients were men (30 vs. 11, by Jan 2, 2020). We also noticed that the only Asian donor (male) has a much higher ACE2-expressing cell ratio than white and African American donors (2.50% vs. 0.47% of all cells). This might explain the observation that the new Coronavirus pandemic and previous SARS-Cov pandemic are concentrated in the Asian area. Altogether, in the current study, we report the RNA expression profile of ACE2 in the human lung at single-cell resolution. Our analysis suggested that the expression of ACE2 is concentrated in a special population of AT2 which expresses many other genes favoring the viral process. This conclusion is different from the previous report which observed abundant ACE2 not only in AT2, but also in endothelial cells 8 . In fact, to our knowledge, endothelial cells sometimes can be non-specifically stained in immunohistochemical analysis. The abundant expression of ACE2 in a population of AT2 explained the severe alveolar damage after infection. The demonstration of the distinct number and distribution of ACE2-expressing cell population in different cohorts can potentially identify the susceptible population. The shortcoming of the study is the small donor sample number, and that the current technique can only analyze the RNA level but not the protein level of single cells. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether there is any other co-receptor responsible for the 2019-nCov infection, which might also help to explain the observed difference of transmission ability between SARS-Cov and 2019-nCov. Future work on the ACE2 receptor profiling could lead to novel anti-infective strategies such as ACE2 protein blockade or ACE2-expressing cell ablation. Methods Public datasets (GEO: GSE122960) were used for bioinformatics analysis. Firstly, we used Seurat (version 2.3.4) to read a combined gene-barcode matrix of all samples. We removed the low-quality cells with less than 200 or more than 6,000 detected genes, or if their mitochondrial gene content was > 10%. Genes were filtered out that were detected in less than 3 cells. For normalization, the combined gene-barcode matrix was scaled by total UMI counts, multiplied by 10,000 and transformed to log space. The highly variable genes were identified using the function FindVariableGenes. Variants arising from number of UMIs and percentage of mitochondrial genes were regressed out by specifying the vars.to.regress argument in Seurat function ScaleData. The expression level of highly variable genes in the cells was scaled and centered along each gene, and was conducted to principal component analysis. Then we assessed the number of PCs to be included in downstream analysis by (1) plotting the cumulative standard deviations accounted for each PC using the function PCElbowPlot in Seurat to identify the \u2018knee\u2019 point at a PC number after which successive PCs explain diminishing degrees of variance, and (2) by exploring primary sources of heterogeneity in the datasets using the PCHeatmap function in Seurat. Based on these two methods, we selected the first top significant PCs for two-dimensional t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE), implemented by the Seurat software with the default parameters. We used FindClusters in Seurat to identify cell clusters for each sample. Following clustering and visualization with t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE), initial clusters were subjected to inspection and merging based on the similarity of marker genes and a function for measuring phylogenetic identity using BuildClusterTree in Seurat. Identification of cell clusters was performed on the final aligned object guided by marker genes. To identify the marker genes, differential expression analysis was performed by the function FindAllMarkers in Seurat with Wilcoxon rank sum test. Differentially expressed genes that were expressed at least in 25% cells within the cluster and with a fold change more than 0.25 (log scale) were considered to be marker genes. tSNE plots and violin plots were generated using Seurat.

It may lead to the false assumption that this was indeed a \"man made\" disease in that laboratory in Wuhan China for biological weapons research, but after carefully looking at the article again, I can say that the researchers who wrote this piece do know their stuff and that they are stating that the fact that Asian people, specifically Asian MEN, have a different make up of Alveolar AT2 cells in their lungs due to natural DNA and RNA make up of their lungs, and that this Wuhan Coronavirus apparently more readily attaches itself to that SPECIFIC makeup.... All this means is that the present Wuhan Coronavirus may indeed be targeting Asian MALES specifically! Nothing artificial therefore to be assumed here at all....\nIt is therefore no wonder that this \"Coronavirus\" is more predominant in China, as it is naturally attracted to lung tissue where it can multiply But hey, this is fact and not fiction here, and try telling this to the criminals in the Jew spew media and even those in the alternative media that are screaming that the \"sky is falling\"....\nHonestly, I do love these scientific reports, for they are RIGHT UP MY ALLEY, and something that brings me back to my University days as a pupil of science I did some dabbling decades ago in Biology as well as my major in Physics, so I find reports like this one to be so refreshing\nI can guarantee one thing, though... There will be those out there that will now scream \"Racism\" after reading this report, as well as claiming that this virus is indeed \"bio-engineered\" due to the fact that it apparently will hit only once certain race of humans... BUT in spite of that ignorance, this is fact and not fiction, and shows once again that we as humans are indeed different in a lot of ways in regards to race, including how we are affected by certain diseases!\nMore to come\nNTS",

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses found in both animals and humans. Some infect people and are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). How Dangerous is it? As with other respiratory illnesses, infection with 2019-nCoV can cause mild symptoms including a runny nose, sore throat, cough, and fever. It can be more severe for some persons and can lead to pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as diabetes and heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. What can I do to protect myself? Stay aware of the latest information on the outbreak, available on the WHO website, and take care of your health by doing the following: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand rub eliminates the virus if it is on your hands. Maintain social distancing \u2013 maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and other people, particularly those who are coughing, sneezing and have a fever. Why? When someone who is infected with respiratory diseases, like 2019-nCoV, coughs or sneezes they project small droplets containing the virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the virus. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth Why? Hands touch many surfaces which can be contaminated with the virus. If you touch your eyes, nose or mouth with your contaminated hands, you can transfer the virus from the surface to yourself. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Tell your health care provider if you have travelled in an area in China where 2019-nCoV has been reported, or if you have been in close contact with someone with who has travelled from China and has respiratory symptoms. Why? Whenever you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing it\u2019s important to seek medical attention promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Respiratory symptoms with fever can have a range of causes, and depending on your personal travel history and circumstances, 2019-nCoV could be one of them. If you have mild respiratory symptoms and no travel history to or within China, carefully practice basic respiratory and hand hygiene and stay home until you are recovered, if possible. Should I wear a mask to protect myself?",

Here are the most important questions and answers about the Corona virus at a glance.\nThe first case of Corona virus has been confirmed in Germany. However, there\u2019s no reason to panic, says Oliver Witzke, director of the Clinic for Infectious Diseases, and the West German Centre for Infectious Diseases, at the University Medical Centre in Essen. \u201cIt was to be expected that individual cases would appear here in Germany, so there\u2019s no need to worry about it.\u201d\nStill, there is widespread anxiety \u2013 Am I at risk? Do I need to protect myself. Here\u2019s an overview of the most important questions and answers. How Dangerous is the Virus?\nFor the moment, many medical facts about the virus remain unclear. The rate of infection, for example, and how aggressive it is. Although, the latter seems to be less so than the Sars outbreak of 2002/2003. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about one case, in Germany, which was quickly recognised. We shouldn\u2019t blow it out of proportion. Influenza kills 20,000 people a year, in Germany alone.\u201d Do I Have to Protect Myself From Infection?\nNo\u2026.and yes. There is no reason to fear the Corona virus in Germany, but it still makes sense to protect yourself from infectious diseases, particularly in light of the current flu epidemic. So Witzke highly recommends getting a flu-shot. It won\u2019t just protect you against Influenza, but will also avoid any confusion with the lung disease. A man enters an isolation area in Bavaria (Foto: dpa) How Can I Best Protect Myself?\nThe best protection against contagious respiratory illness, whether Corona virus, the flu or the common cold, is hygiene. That means: lots of hand-washing, less hand-shaking, and being careful when coughing or sneezing. \u201cIf it\u2019s impossible to suppress it, you should sneeze into your sleeve, or into your armpit, to safeguard your immediate surroundings,\u201d said Witzke. \u201cA breathing mask is not effective protection against infection. Running out to buy one now would be be a senseless, panic reaction.\u201d Where Can I Get More Information?\nThe Robert Koch Institute and the Federal Centre for Health Education have websites where you can find answers to the most important questions. The health insurance authority has set up a 24 hour helpline for all telephone enquiries (0800 84 84 111). This is meant to answer questions from all citizens, not just their own customers.\n",

There have been reports of Chinese nationals in our country giving out free face masks to people. And this elevator experience of netizen Clarisse Evangelista hopefully will make us rethink about some of the actions and words we show to our Chinese brothers and sisters. The 25-year-old, from Davao City who is a certified public accountant in Manila, shared on her Facebook account her heartbreaking experience with a Chinese family living in the same building as her. \u201cI\u2019m sad. We have Chinese neighbors sa condo, and just now may nakasabay kaming lalaki (Chinese) with 2 kids. Sila dapat \u2018yong nauna dun sa elevator. But when he saw us (Filipinos) behind him, umatras siya with his kids at nagpahuli. Hindi sila sumabay. I heard the kids asked their dad why, but he just shushed them. Kasakit man sa heart,\u201d says Evangelista on her post. She went on and told CDN Digital that she posted her experience to share awareness in order to stop this kind of stigma that is being experienced by the Chinese nationals. \u201cIt is heartbreaking. They don\u2019t have to shy away if only we are considerate. They don\u2019t deserve our hate for something they didn\u2019t wish to have nor happen in their lives,\u201d adds Evangelista. Evangelista shared her experience online on January 30 and as of February 1, the post has already generated 51,000 reactions, 2,500 comments, and 105,000 shares. \n",

Pat Harkins, of Erie, D-1st Dist., called for a state investigation into conditions at the nursing home.\nHarkins said he has received numerous complaints from residents\u2019 family members and Twinbrook staff about shortages in basic supplies and other problems.\nHe said Thursday that he would fight \"tooth and nail\" to prevent Twinbrook from being designated a COVID-19 recovery unit.\nThe nursing home also performed poorly on a patient care inspection conducted by the state Department of Health in January.\nErie County Executive Kathy Dahlkemper has also expressed concerns about the Twinbrook plan. At her daily news conference on COVID-19 on Friday, Dahlkemper said she is working with Harkins and the state Department of Health on \"rectifying the situation.\"\n\"From everything that we\u2019ve been able to deduce, there is not a need in Erie County for more skilled nursing beds for COVID-19-positive patients,\" Dahlkemper said. \"If we don\u2019t have a need, I would prefer that more of those beds not be created.\n\"Certainly I would very much prefer that no one be brought into Erie County who is COVID-19 positive and isn\u2019t a current resident of our community.\"",

Of about 2,000 cities in China with factories and other facilities in Bloomberg\u2019s supply chain database, the city ranks 13th, with about 500 facilities. The province of Hubei has 1,016, making it seventh of 32 such jurisdictions. U.S.-based companies have 44 facilities there, and European ones about 40, the data show. Many plants are in the auto and transportation industries, and big names include PepsiCo Inc. and Siemens AG.\nAs the death toll from the pneumonia-like illness rises and cases are found in neighboring Asian countries, including South Korea and Singapore, as well as in the U.S., the economic impact of the novel corona virus could be widespread.\nHere is a rundown of what big companies are saying so far about the impact. Jan. 26: Honda Motor Co. The automaker will evacuate from Wuhan about 30 Japanese staff, family members and employees visiting on business trips. The carmaker had informed the Japanese government that it wishes to utilise the charter jet planned to evacuate Japanese citizens. A handful of staff needed to maintain local operations would remain in the city. Jan. 25: Groupe PSA The French maker of Peugeot cars and other brands said it will evacuate its expatriate staff and their families from the Wuhan area. A total of 38 people will leave, the company said in a statement. Hennes and Mauritz AB The clothing retailer better known as H&M has closed a total of 13 stores in the region. China is the company\u2019s 5th biggest market in terms of revenue, with 524 stores as of Aug. 31. Ikea closed its warehouse in Wuhan on Thursday last week. Jan. 24: Remy Cointreau SA The French cognac maker abandoned its forecasts for this year after a slump in Hong Kong dented sales in the Christmas period and as the viral outbreak threatens business in China, the source of 20% of its profit, according to Jefferies estimates. \u201cClearly we are concerned,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Luca Marotta said of the corona virus on an earnings conference call. \u201cWe do not have any scenarios on a quantified basis. It is evolving hour after hour.\u2019\u2019 McDonald\u2019s Corp. The fast-food giant, which had about 3,000 stores in China at the end of 2018, temporarily closed locations across five cities of the Hubei province due to the virus, including Wuhan. The Chicago-based company is taking extra preventative measures in the rest of the country, including taking the temperature of workers upon arrival and giving out hand sanitizers to diners. Walt Disney Co. The world\u2019s largest theme park operator said it would close its Disneyland resort in Shanghai effective Jan. 25. The company is offering refunds to guests who bought theme park tickets or reserved rooms in its hotels. \u201cWe will continue to carefully monitor the situation and be in close contact with the local government, and we will announce the reopening date upon confirmation,\u201d it said in a statement. Starbucks Corp. The Seattle-based chain, with about 4,100 cafes in China, also said it\u2019s closing some locations, without providing more details. Delta Air Lines Inc. The Atlanta-based carrier issued a travel waiver that allows passengers traveling to, from or through Beijing and Shanghai between Jan. 24 and Jan. 31 to change their itinerary once without having to pay a fee. Wynn Resorts Ltd. The Chinese Lunar New Year is peak time for profits at casino operators. Authorities in Macau, the world\u2019s largest gambling market, are requiring casinos to screen guests for high temperatures and make their staff wear respirator masks. Many Chinese tourists are also heading to Las Vegas to celebrate. \u201cAlthough as of this date there are no reported cases of the corona virus in Las Vegas that we are aware of, we will be in close contact with the Southern Nevada Health District who is monitoring the situation along with the CDC,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe will implement any health directive they issue.\u201d Jan. 23: Avnet Inc. The Phoenix-based distributor of computer products and semiconductors said it hadn\u2019t seen an impact so far. \u201cBut if it gets worse and they start shutting down airplanes, et cetera, then that will have a different effect on shipments out of China,\u201d CEO Bill Amelio said on a conference call. Asked whether the area is a meaningful region from an electronics manufacturing perspective, Amelio answered: \u201cOf course, it is.\u2019\u2019 American Airlines Group Inc. President Robert Isom said it is too soon to see an impact. \u201cOur network isn\u2019t that extensive in Asia. But we\u2019re on top of it,\u201d he said on a conference call. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen viruses in the past that we\u2019ve had to make accommodations for and to be prepared for, we\u2019re doing all those same things right now.\u201d Keppel Corp. The Singapore-based owner of the largest oil-rig builder, which has about 170 employees in Wuhan and operations across China, said it hadn\u2019t seen a direct impact either. \u201cWe have advised our operations there and our staff there to take the necessary precautions. We are watching this very closely,\u201d CEO Loh Chin Hua said on an earnings call. Jan. 22 United Airlines Holdings Inc. The U.S. carrier was among the first global corporations to comment on the corona virus on an earnings conference call. \u201cWe\u2019ve been coordinating closely with the CDC to ensure that we\u2019re taking all the necessary steps to ensure that our customers and employees can travel safely,\u201d CEO Oscar Munoz said. \u201cBy working closely together, we have in the past effectively managed situations like this.\u201d",

On Friday the department said it has advised quarantine for 80 persons across the State with a recent travel history to China.\n\u201cThese persons are mostly Malayali medical students and nurses in China, some business travellers and some Chinese citizens visiting the State. Of these 80 persons, seven who displayed mild influenza-like symptoms have been isolated in various medical colleges in districts as a matter of abundant caution. The rest have no symptoms but have been advised home quarantine and to alert the local health administration in the event they develop any symptoms like fever. We will be following them up,\u201d State Nodal Officer for Public Health Emergencies Amar Fettle said.\nOne person each has been isolated in Thiruvananthapuram, Pathanamthitta, Thrissur, Malappuram and Kozhikode and two in Ernakulam. None of them are sick but have been isolated as per the protocol as the situation with nCoV is still evolving, Dr. Fettle said. Three types of samples\nThree types of samples have been collected from these persons -- throat/nasal swabs, deep respiratory secretions and blood samples -- and have been sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, which is currently the sole testing centre. However, by February second week, testing facilities are expected to be available at NIV\u2019s Alapuzha unit,\nMeanwhile, with China closing down Wuhan and imposing a total travel ban, there are reports that some 20 Malayali medical students who were planning to head home during the Lunar New Year holidays are stranded in the city.\nLabour Minister T. P. Ramakrishnan has written to the Centre seeking its urgent intervention to allay the concerns of students stranded in China and the Malayali nurses in Saudi Arabia who have been placed in isolation after one of them fell sick, having contracted MERS-corona infection from one of the patients she had been caring for.
