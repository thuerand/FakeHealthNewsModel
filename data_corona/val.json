It\u2019s not clear if Facebook has provided an explanation for the group\u2019s removal.\n\nVisiting the page gives the following message: \u201cSorry, this content isn\u2019t available right now.\u201d\n\nGarrett Soldano of Mattawan, Michigan created Michiganders Against Excessive Quarantine in April after becoming disenchanted with Governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home order \u2013 a policy which he initially supported.\n\nThe group made headlines around the world after organizing \u2018Operation Gridlock\u2019, a protest in which thousands of cars created bumper-to-bumper traffic in the capital, Lansing.\n\nProtesters were encouraged to stay in their automobiles and adhere to social distancing guidelines. However, several hundred demonstrators ended up rallying outside the state house.\n\nMany members of the group used the space to talk about the depression and financial hardships that they were experiencing as a result of the governor\u2019s executive orders, first enacted in March 23, which have forced all \u2018non-essential\u2019 businesses and to remain closed. Whitmer unilaterally extended her emergency powers in May, after the legislature voted to let them expire. The governor has used these executive powers as the legal basis for the state\u2019s lockdown.\n\n\u201cThey will not silence us,\u201d Soldano said in a video message after the group was deleted.\n\n\u201cThis just proves to all of us out there that we were right. That there is a deep agenda going on. They\u2019re trying to keep us quiet\u2026 Now we fight back. And we have the numbers.\u201d\n\nFor now, the message is unavailable on Facebook. On Wednesday, Soldano began promoting a new page, Stand Up Michigan, which gained thousands of members before also being pulled from the site.\n\nThe removal of Soldan\u2019s anti-lockdown group has not gone unnoticed on social media. Former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson described the decision to pull the page as a clear example of \u201ccensorship.\u201d\n\nSome challenged the notion, apparently arguing that the group\u2019s beliefs were not worthy of being protected. Even Elon Musk, who re-opened his Tesla plant in California in defiance of local officials, weighed in. Last month, Facebook deleted anti-lockdown pages that were organizing demonstrations in California, Nebraska, and New Jersey, claiming that the groups were in violation of those states\u2019 stay-at-home orders.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech giant announced that it would be working with fact-checkers to \u201cstop the spread of misinformation and harmful content about Covid-19.\u201d An update regarding the policy, dated May 12, states that the platform put warning labels on around 50 million \u201cpieces of content related to Covid-19.\u201d ",

Michael Hickey/Getty Images Purdue University President Mitch Daniels said last week that the school is planning to offer in-person courses in the fall. Daniels estimated 80% of the campus' population are under the age of 35 and claimed that COVID-19 posed \"zero lethal danger\" to those students. He offered a host of possible steps the university might take to prevent the spread of the virus, including the \"pre-testing\" of students and faculty before August and a \"robust testing system during the school year.\" While young people do not typically suffer from the most severe side effects of COVID-19, they can still die from the disease and be carriers of it, posing danger to at-risk groups. Visit Insider's homepage for more stories . Purdue University President Mitch Daniels, the former governor of Indiana, said in an April 21 letter he intends to open the West Lafayette, Indiana university for in-person classes in the fall, citing an almost \"zero lethal threat\" to young people from COVID-19.\n\"At least 80% of our population is made up of young people, say, 35 and under,\" Daniels said of Purdue's makeup. \"All data to date tell us that the COVID-19 virus, while it transmits rapidly in this age group, poses close to zero lethal threat to them.\"\nDaniels said he estimated about 20% of the university's population was over 35 years old and contained a \"significant number of people with diabetes, asthma, hypertension, and other ailments.\"\n\"We will consider new policies and practices that keep these groups separate, or minimize contact between them. Literally, our students pose a far greater danger to others than the virus poses to them,\" Daniels said.\nWhile senior adults and individuals with underlying health conditions are most at risk for the most serious symptoms and side effects of COVID-19, young people can still contract \u2014 and die \u2014 from the disease.\nThe World Health Organization in March warned young people that they weren't invincible to the serious effects of COVID-19, and could be hospitalized and killed by the disease caused by the novel coronavirus . Last week, doctors in New York reported instances of strokes of large-vessel strokes experienced by young people with only mild symptoms of the virus.\nYoung people can also be asymptomatic carriers, spreading the virus without even realizing they have contracted the novel coronavirus. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said earlier in April \" somewhere between 25% and 50%\" of people infected with the virus may never show symptoms or become sick \u2014 but can still transmit the illness to others.\nDaniels said Purdue would consider the \"pre-testing\" of students and faculty before August and implementing a \"robust testing system during the school year.\" He also said people over the age of 35 and people who have health conditions that put them at risk could either be asked or ordered to work from home.\nClasses could be spread across days and times to reduce their size, Daniels said, adding Purdue could adopt more online instruction for students living on campus.\nHe said the university expected \"to be able to trace proximate and/or frequent contacts of those who test positive\" and vulnerable people who had contact with an infected person would be ordered to self-quarantine for a two-week period.\nThose who come in contact with an infected person but do not test positive for the virus would be monitored for symptoms as well.\n\"These concepts are preliminary, intended mainly to illustrate an overall, data-driven and research-based strategy, and to invite suggestions for their modification or exclusion in favor of better actions,\" Daniels wrote.\nThe move comes as colleges and universities, who abruptly kicked students off of campus and moved instruction online earlier this year, grapple with their plans for the future as health experts warn a vaccine for COVID-19 might not arrive before 2022.\nRead the original article on Insider",

Trump also hit out at a study on hydroxychloroquine, claiming it can have severe side effects leading to death, calling the results a \u201cTrump enemy statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked with doctors and if you look at the one survey \u2013 the only bad survey \u2013 they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape. They were very old, almost dead.\u201d the President asserted.\n\nTrump again claimed that many front line healthcare workers are taking hydroxychloroquine. \u201cA lot of our front line workers take it because it possibly and \u2013 I think it does but you know these people are going to have to make up their own mind. Plus, it doesn\u2019t hurt people. It\u2019s been out of the market for 60 or 65 years for malaria, lupus and other things,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think it gives you an additional level of safety, but you can ask many doctors are in favor of it.

Those are the six new symptoms the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautioned could be signs of the coronavirus. The additions come as health experts' understanding of the confounding disease evolves. The CDC previously listed fever, cough and shortness of breath as symptoms. Shortness of breath was tweaked to \"shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\" by the CDC. Coronavirus patients can experience a diversity of issues \u2013 from mild symptoms to severe illness. These symptoms generally appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. Patients may be most infectious in the days before they began showing symptoms, studies show . Most testing sites require a patient to have a COVID-19 symptom before the individual can be tested. The CDC recommends seeking \"medical attention immediately\" for trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure on chest, bluish lips or face or a new \"confusion or inability to arouse.\" As COVID-19 has tightened its grip on the world in the past three months, medical comprehension of the virus has advanced. The World Health Organization and CDC first urged the public to be on the lookout for fever, dry cough and breathing difficulties. Then came strange reports of people losing their sense of taste and smell. And there were sporadic cases of gastrointestinal issues , such as diarrhea. Another more recent phenomenon: purple or blue lesions on a patient\u2019s feet and toes, most commonly appearing in children and young adults, dubbed \u201cCOVID toes.\u201d Though experts can\u2019t pinpoint the condition, some hypothesized that it could be excess inflammation, a clotting of blood vessels or a thrombotic disorder known as purpura fulminans. Some doctors reported that the virus may trigger sudden strokes in adults in their 30s and 40s, which could be a result of blood clotting issues. \"The virus seems to be causing increased clotting in the large arteries, leading to severe stroke,\" Dr. Thomas Oxley told CNN . \"Our report shows a sevenfold increase in incidence of sudden stroke in young patients during the past two weeks. Most of these patients have no past medical history and were at home with either mild symptoms (or in two cases, no symptoms) of COVID,\" said Oxley, a neurosurgeon at Mount Sinai Health System in New York.

        "content": "Print Thousands of clinical trials have launched in an effort to better understand the SARS-CoV-2 virus and in search of drugs to successfully treat the symptoms of infection. While these studies are ongoing, doctors are scrambling to make treatment decisions for severely ill COVID-19 patients based on limited, anecdotal evidence on safety and efficacy. This uncertainty is prompting some questions about whether pharmacogenetics may be useful in helping guide treatment decisions, perhaps by identifying those who might respond particularly well to a drug, or alternatively, by flagging patients who may be at risk for life-threatening adverse events because of genetic factors or other drugs they might be taking. Specifically, since some of the most talked about and controversial drugs being tried for COVID-19 carry the risk of arrhythmias and sudden death, experts believe there may be a role for PGx testing in identifying patients who are already genetically predisposed to such adverse events with drugs they're taking. Knowing this information in advance, they said, could help physicians make more informed treatment choices. For experimental COVID-19 treatment modalities where there may not be clear evidence of a drug/gene interaction, experts hope that the ongoing drug studies in which researchers are exploring the role of biomarkers will yield more definitive data. Ultimately, however, the real utility of PGx testing may not be in helping guide treatments for COVID-19, some predict, but as a supportive tool during the mental health pandemic that will follow. Managing risks Houda Hachad, CSO of precision medicine developer Translational Software, said there's the potential that PGx testing could help avoid drug-drug-gene interactions with hydroxychloroquine, which is currently approved to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus. This drug, however, is known to cause arrhythmias in patients with existing cardiovascular disease, who also happen to be at increased risk for COVID-19. This week, a panel of experts convened by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recommended that doctors not prescribe hydroxychloroquine together with the antibiotic azithromycin \u2014 a combination promoted by President Donald Trump \u2014 because of the risk of sudden cardiac death and QTc prolongation, a heart rhythm disorder that can potentially cause fast, chaotic heartbeats. The American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and Heart Rhythm Society have cautioned the same. The expert groups recommend closely monitoring the heart rhythms of patients on these drugs, and if possible, avoiding other QTc prolonging therapies. Hachad noted that when patients are evaluated for the risk for QTc prolongation, physicians use a scoring system that factors in the QTc prolonging drugs they're already taking. PGx testing can be helpful in this context, by identifying individuals with certain CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genotypes that place them at increased risk for cardiac events if they are already on a long list of frequently prescribed drugs. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration lists several of the drugs that carry the risk of QTc prolongation in its recently published \"Table of Pharmacogenetic Associations.\" According to this table, individuals who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers are at greater risk than normal metabolizers for QTc prolongation if they are receiving the antidepressant citalopram. Based on expert guidelines and FDA prescribing label information, CYP2C19 poor metabolizers should receive a lower dose of the drug. Citalopram was the 26th most prescribed drug in the U.S., with more than 24 million scripts written in 2017. If a patient who metabolizes CYP2C19 poorly was on citalopram and also received hydroxychloroquine, it could compound their risk for life-threatening arrhythmias. According to Hachad, there are numerous other examples like this where PGx information can help doctors more accurately gauge patients' cumulative risk for QT prolongation when considering whether to treat a COVID-19 patient with a drug combination like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. An app to inform the public In the process of writing a review on drugs that are currently being tried for COVID-19, pharmacogenetics expert Howard McLeod noted that there was no place for the general public to input the drugs they are on and educate themselves about the potential drug/gene, drug/drug, or drug/disease interactions they may be at risk for if they became infected with the virus and had to go on an experimental therapy. Meanwhile, demand for hydroxychloroquine has surged despite a lack of evidence supporting its use in COVID-19 patients outside of clinical trials. Amid the hype and politics around this drug, one of McLeod's colleagues was wondering whether to use hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis and entered the drug into a medication management app called Pharmazam. It revealed that since he was already on an antifungal fluconazole, he would be at risk for long QT syndrome if he took hydroxychloroquine. In terms of the PGx interactions the app may flag that may be of interest in the context of the pandemic, Taimour Langaee CSO of biotech firm Pharmazam highlighted that polymorphisms in ABCC1 and SLCO1B1 transporters, and G6PD, are known to cause adverse effects from hydroxychloroquine. Additionally, with antiviral drugs, such as ritonavir and lopinavir, which are also being tried for COVID-19, there are transporters, as well as CYP450 and glucuronidation variants, that may impact response. Using pharmacogenetics to guide treatment choice, on the other hand, has had a hard slog in terms of gaining acceptance in mainstream medical circles. Many doctors have resisted incorporating information from PGx testing into their day-to-day workflows, except in very limited circumstances where there is a risk of a life-threatening adverse event. There is still differing views in medical circles regarding the utility of PGx testing to dose warfarin or clopidogrel, despite guidelines and FDA labeling supporting testing. Physician reluctance continues to be an issue in the adoption of PGx testing, McLeod acknowledged, adding that \"the healthcare system needs to be ready in order to get the full benefits of this sort of application.\" Additionally, while doctors are trying to treat patients in an emergent crisis, pharmacogenetics may not be top of mind, and likely to be ignored when there is unclear messaging from health regulators about when to test patients for PGx variants that may be at issue with experimental COVID-19 drugs. For example, the FDA-approved labels for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine state that these drugs should be prescribed with caution in patients with G6PD deficiency, since they may be at increased risk for hemolytic anemia \u2014 where the body breaks down red blood cells faster than it can replenish them. However, the FDA labels don't explicitly recommend PGx testing. Similarly, when the FDA put out a fact sheet for healthcare providers about the emergency use authorization of hydroxychloroquine, the agency noted that hemolytic anemia has been seen in G6PD-deficient patients, but again, doesn't provide any guidance on testing. Advancing research \"There does seem to be some mixed messaging about G6PD\" deficiency and hydroxychloroquine, noted Michelle Whirl-Carrillo, director of PharmGKB, an online knowledgebase of expertly curated information on the role of genetic variants on drug response. PharmGKB recently launched an online COVID-19 resource to help identify drug-drug interactions. The webpage lists the drugs involved in COVID-19 trials and which of those have PGx information within PharmGKB, and notes the drugs associated with long QT syndrome. There is also a listing of genes implicated in drug adverse events and metabolism, as well as the genes involved in allowing SARS-CoV-2 viral cell entry and infection. The bolus of drug and genomics research occurring during the pandemic is an opportunity to assess whether there is a role for genetics in personalizing COVID-19 treatment. Teri Klein, a principal investigator for PharmGKB, estimated there are more than 6,000 COVID-19 related peer-reviewed papers that have been published in the couple of months since the pandemic started. \"In the next month or so, we really will have a much better understanding of a number of these drugs,\" Klein said, noting that many of the experimental drug studies have rapidly enrolled and are expecting readouts on efficacy and safety relatively quickly. \"In clinical trials, often you have a hard time getting a cohort,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, given the circumstances, we don't have difficulty getting people to sign up for these experimental treatments.\" Within Pharmazam's COVID19 PGx Project, experts are hoping to learn more about the pharmacogenetics of drugs being tried for COVID-19 and exploring the genetic factors that might make an individual more susceptible to infection and to experiencing severe symptoms. Particularly of interest within the project are ACE2 and TMPRSS2, genes that play role in allowing the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter a cell and infect it. Other research teams are also studying these genes and have already identified certain ACE2 polymorphisms that appear to make patients more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Kristine Ashcraft, former CEO of YouScript, a medication management decision support tool provider, believes that the broader value proposition for PGx as a tool to keep patients out of the emergency room and hospitals is particularly relevant during this pandemic. Studies show patients who get genetic testing are less likely to end up in the emergency room or hospital for a serious adverse event. Managing the mental health pandemic While researchers are working to advance drugs to treat COVID-19 and vaccines to give people immunity against the virus, the mental health impact of the pandemic will also have to be managed. This is where PGx testing may be most useful, experts in the field said. \"It is worthwhile to consider not just the utility of PGx in preventing hospitalization or changing the course of COVID-19 care,\" but also the impact it could have on managing \"the burden on the patients that do survive a COVID-19 infection \u2026 [and] those that are suffering from the isolation of social distancing, as well as the financial hardships,\" said David Thacker, a clinical pharmacogenetics content specialist at Translational Software. According to a recent JAMA editorial, during the SARS outbreak in 2003, there was a greater incidence of post-traumatic stress syndrome and psychological distress among patients and doctors. In communities impacted by Hurricane Ike in 2008, around 5% of individuals met the criteria for major depressive disorder, while one in 10 adults in New York City had symptoms of the disorder after 9/11. \"In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it appears likely that there will be substantial increases in anxiety and depression, substance use, loneliness, and domestic violence; and with schools closed, there is a very real possibility of an epidemic of child abuse,\" wrote Sandro Galea from Boston University School of Public Health, Raina Merchant from the Perelman School of Medicine, and Nicole Lurie from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations in Norway. A survey in March by the American Psychiatric Association found that more than a third of polled individuals said that the pandemic was seriously impacting their mental health, nearly half said they were scared about getting the virus, and 62% said they feared a loved one would get it. Meanwhile, calls to substance abuse and mental health help lines increased eightfold from February to March. As the pandemic continues, people may increasingly turn to medications to deal with the psychological wounds left by the pandemic. Drugs to treat mental health conditions, including major depressive disorder, are some of the most widely prescribed drugs in the U.S., but they're also highly variable and associated with unwanted side effects. As such, one of the main areas where PGx testing has seen uptake is for personalizing psychiatry drugs. Myriad Genetics recently published a meta-analysis involving more than 1,500 patients with major depressive disorder who were enrolled in four studies, which showed that patients who received treatment based on PGx information had significantly better outcomes than those who did not. Although PGx testing in psychiatry is not without its naysayers, doctors may reach for such testing if the use of mental health drugs increases during or after the pandemic. Genomind, a mental health-focused PGx testing company, recently took a number of steps to make it easier for physicians to deliver psychiatric care during the pandemic. Doctors can order Genomind's PGx test and send a saliva collection kit to patient's homes, which can then be mailed to the lab for analysis. Through Genomind, doctors also have access to Sharecare's HIPAA-compliant telemedicine platform for free until September, which they can use to remotely see patients and discuss PGx test results, if ordered. \"The utility of PGx during the COVID-19 crisis is more important than ever,\" a spokesperson for the company said. \"This service is helping enable critical mental health treatment during the pandemic and Genomind is doing its best to enable as many mental health professionals as possible.\"",

        "content": "Norfolk County has drafted a three-step plan for how to protect public health during COVID-19.\nIn a release sent out from the county, it says these steps include containing the spread of the virus with more testing, expanding capacity to treat patients in the community, and increase the number of ventilators in the community.\nThe full press release can be found below:\nNorfolk County has implemented a multifaceted response plan in the face of an unprecedented public health emergency.\nAlthough recent modelling suggests Ontario may have reached a peak in new cases of COVID-19, a vaccine for the virus has not yet been developed, leaving the population at continued risk of infection.\nBy taking early action, however, Norfolk remains ready for a possible surge in cases, and will continue to fight the transmission of the virus among local residents.\nKey staff from a range of departments have been working since mid-March \u2013 when Norfolk activated its Emergency Operations Centre \u2013 on the County\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWith the guidance of Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit, staff have enacted a strategic three-step, multi-layered plan:\nStep 1: Containing the spread of COVID-19 : This includes identifying and testing people who might have the virus. Over the past month, the Health Unit has fielded more than 3,000 calls from community members. Working with health centres and partner hospitals, approximately 1,000 tests have been completed. The Health Unit has a team of experienced nurses with infection control experience in a variety of infection control priorities including monitoring and outbreak management in health care institutions. Success with containment will reduce or eliminate the need for the following two steps.\nStep 2: Expanding capacity to treat patients in the community : If the spread of the virus is not contained, hospital capacity could be exceeded. Norfolk County and Haldimand County have each created two interim care centres to support the healthcare system. These facilities can serve a variety of purposes as the pandemic progresses, including providing care for certain in-patients or community-residing patients.\nStep 3: Increasing the number of ventilators available to patients in the area : In the worst case scenario, Norfolk County and Haldimand County want to ensure that everyone who needs a ventilator is able to have one.\nCombined with Norfolk\u2019s swift actions on operational issues, such as closing facilities to the public and cancelling programming, the plan means the County is in a strong position to deal with the pandemic \u2013 and a potential surge in COVID-19 cases.\n\u201cMany other areas are looking to build off-site care facilities, or are attempting to increase their supply of ventilators, but we\u2019re already there,\u201d says Kristal Chopp, Mayor of Norfolk County and Chair of the Haldimand-Norfolk Board of Health. \u201cObviously I hope these efforts are entirely in vain, but should a surge in COVID-19 cases come to our area, we will be ready.\u201d\nStep 1: Stopping the spread of COVID-19\nThe Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit has implemented strict measures designed to stop the spread of COVID-19.\nThese early actions (the first of which was ordered on March 16) included: restrictions on food and beverage premises, the prohibition of mass gatherings, the closure of tattoo parlours, barbershops, hair and nail salons, spas, tanning beds and banquet halls, and self-isolation orders for those returning to Canada from abroad and for incoming migrant workers.\n\u201cStaying at home for many weeks is not easy. But these measures are critical to preventing the transmission of the virus to older residents and people with underlying health issues,\u201d says Dr. Nesathurai.\nNorfolk County has also stepped up the enforcement of social distancing rules and public health orders, doubling its number of bylaw officers and expanding the amount of time they\u2019re on patrol in the community.\nStep 2: Providing support for local hospitals\nThe Emergency Operations Centre has a plan to provide support for area hospitals in the event that efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 fail and patient volumes increase.\nWith the guidance of the Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit, and working with local healthcare partners, staff quickly developed and implemented a plan to open an off-site, interim care centre located at the Port Dover arena. Haldimand County staff have developed a similar facility, located at the Dunnville arena. These sites expand the capacity of traditional clinical sites, and can be deployed on short notice to help patients with a variety of clinical problems.\nStaff have secured personal protective equipment and supplies, signed up volunteers with healthcare experience, and made a number of infrastructure upgrades (such as updates to the electrical and HVAC systems) to the Port Dover arena. The facility is now ready should it be needed. It can be opened with just 48 hours\u2019 notice.\nStep 3: Increasing the number of ventilators available in the area\nVentilators, or breathing machines, are necessary to provide care to those most seriously impacted by COVID-19. But there are only approximately ten such machines available at hospitals in Haldimand and Norfolk. In a severe pandemic, with many additional cases, doctors would be forced to make difficult decisions about who would get life-saving treatment and who would not.\nNorfolk County was able to identify 15 additional basic ventilators, which were previously used by the paramedic service. The Emergency Operations Centre has been working with three local companies on an innovative plan to increase ventilator capability and supply in the region. Through these unique partnerships, two basic ventilators have been produced.\nIn addition, a local aerospace firm has made a more sophisticated ventilator, and 50 of these units will be available to residents. This creative solution has been so successful that these devices are of interest to a large US government agency looking to expand their ventilator capacity.\n",

        "content": "In my first week in the House of Representatives in 1976, I cast one of the two votes against legislation appropriating funds for a swine flu vaccination program.\n\nA swine flu outbreak was then dominating headlines, so most in DC were frantic to \u201cdo something\u201d about the virus.\n\nUnfortunately, the hastily developed and rushed-into-production swine flu vaccine was not only ineffective, it was dangerous.\n\nApproximately 50 people who received the vaccine subsequently contracted Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a potentially fatal form of paralysis.\n\nAccording to an expert with the Centers for Disease Control, the incidence of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 was four times higher among those who received the swine flu vaccine than in the general population.  That sad history may soon repeat itself. Right now, governments and private industries are working to rapidly develop and deploy a coronavirus vaccine. Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who is a major funder of these efforts, has suggested everyone who receives a vaccine be issued a \u201cdigital certificate\u201d proving he has been vaccinated. Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose record of wrong predictions makes him the Bill Kristol of epidemiology, also wants individuals to carry some proof they have been vaccinated.\n\nAnother authoritarian proposal floated to deal with coronavirus is to force everyone to download a phone app that will track their movements. This would allow government officials to identify those who may have been near anyone who may have had coronavirus. Such mandatory \u201ccontact tracing\u201d is an assault on our privacy and liberty.\n\nVaccines can improve health. For example, vaccines helped reduce the incidence of diseases like polio. But not all vaccines are safe and effective for all people. Furthermore, certain modern practices, such as giving infants multiple vaccines at one time, may cause health problems. The fact that vaccines may benefit some people, or even most people, does not justify government forcing individuals to be vaccinated. It also does not justify vaccinating children against their parents\u2019 wishes. And it certainly does not justify keeping individuals and families in involuntary quarantine because they do not have \u201cdigital certificates\u201d proving they have had their shots.\n\nIf government can force individuals to receive medical treatment against their will, then there is no reason why government cannot force individuals to buy medical insurance, prohibit them from owning firearms, dictate their terms of employment, and prevent them from taking arguably harmful actions like smoking marijuana or drinking raw milk. Similarly, if government can override parents\u2019 wishes regarding medical treatment for their children, then there is no reason why government cannot usurp parental authority in other areas, such as education.\n\nProponents of mandatory vaccines and enhanced surveillance are trying to blackmail the American people by arguing that the lockdown cannot end unless we create a healthcare surveillance state and make vaccination mandatory. The growing number of Americans who are tired of not being able to go to work, school, or church, or even to take their children to a park because of government mandates should reject this \u201cdeal.\u201d Instead, they should demand an immediate end to the lockdowns and the restoration of individual responsibility for deciding how best to protect their health.",

Apparently, such peaceful assembly has been deemed \u201cunsafe\u201d by the California Highway Patrol, and the law enforcement entity has decided to suspend the First Amendment until further notice.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom has not publicly commented on the issue.\nMany states, notably Michigan, have imposed strict \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders.\n\nThat state banned gatherings of 10 or more people, and barred residents from traveling to visit other residents.\n\nBut even Democrat Governor Gretchen Whitmer did not ban protests of her orders, though she did extend the lockdown after the latest round of angry citizens protested at the State Capitol.\n\nWith the nation\u2019s economy collapsing, 22 million unemployed Americans, and experts predicting a recession, many citizens are bucking to reopen the country and get back to work.\n\nNot everyone thinks the country should reopen just yet, though.\n\nNurses clashed with protestors in a wild scene in Arizona Tuesday, as tempers flared between healthcare workers and those who don\u2019t believe the lockdown is warranted.",

The virus has now infected 62 people in Wuhan, city authorities said, with eight in a severe condition, 19 cured and discharged from hospital, and the rest remaining in isolation receiving treatment. Cases were also reported in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen as hundreds of million of Chinese are traveling home to celebrate the Spring Festival on January 25. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said the new virus is not SARS, and dismissed claims there has been a cover-up in the reporting of cases outside Wuhan. However, the South China Morning Post report that a doctor in Shanghai, where a suspected case has been reported, says his hospital is preparing staff to deal with a possible pneumonia outbreak. China\u2019s National Health Commission reiterated that the outbreak was \u201cpreventable and controllable\u201d, despite the fact that that the source of the virus has yet to be found and its path has yet to be fully mapped.\nThree airports in major U.S. hubs will begin screening passengers arriving from Wuhan in response to the outbreak. The screening will start at airports in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced. Medical personnel will begin taking temperatures and asking about symptoms of passengers who travelled from the city. The illness was first reported in December. Fears of a more widespread outbreak arose last week when two cases were found in Thailand and one in Japan, carrying the same virus. At least a half-dozen countries in Asia, including Thailand and Japan, have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China.\nOver the next few weeks, some 5,000 passengers are likely to be screened in the U.S., said Dr Martin Cetron, Director of CDC \u2019s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine. The chance for an epidemic in the US is deemed low, the officer at the CDC said, and the agency\u2019s response is preventive. The CDC is deploying about 100 experts to the three airports. Roughly 60,000 to 65,000 people a year travel from Wuhan to the U.S. New York and San Francisco are the only two cities that have direct flights from Wuhan. Those passengers arriving in Los Angeles are on connecting flights.\nMore than 40 cases of the newly identified coronavirus have been confirmed in Asia, including two deaths \u2013 at least one involving a previous medical condition. Most of the patients are believed to have contracted the virus from exposure to animals to a specific seafood and meat market in Wuhan, but it is no increasingly likely that the disease can also spread from person to person. Chinese authorities said that no illnesses were reported among several hundred health care workers caring for the patients, but a recent case in China was a patient who did not go to the markets,\nA different coronavirus caused the SARS outbreak in 2003, which originated in China and was spread to other countries by travelers, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing nearly 800.",

You could call this one \u2018Are You Sicker Than a CNN Anchor?\u2019\u201d\nA colorful graphic appeared then on-screen with the name of the faux reality show Arroyo had just suggested, followed by a mash-up of CNN journalists detailing their experiences with the virus.\nAfter the montage, Arroyo put aside the fact that he first presented the segment by chuckling with Ingraham when rolling out the silly reality show name and graphic and said, \u201cLaura, the self-referential emoting is what is so galling. People are dying and losing their livelihoods. Chances are, young and healthy anchors will not succumb to the disease.\u201d\nArroyo continued, \u201cAnd to keep this narrative going every night that\u2019s so personal, it is disturbing. Because you lose all perspective. It is great to have perspective, but to become the story is a big problem here. And CNN really should tamp down their personal stories. It\u2019s too much.\u201d\nIngraham then chimed in saying she\u2019s \u201cglad [the CNN newscasters] are ok.\u201d But she followed that expression wishing them well with an ironic take that was rather astonishing.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really get it,\u201d Ingraham said of the newsworthiness of CNN\u2019s coverage. \u201cIs that the news?\u201d Ingraham asked.\nAsking \u201cIs that news?\u201d while in the midst of a five-minute jokey segment on the topic during one the higher-rated, primetime programs on a so-called news channel is rich. If CNN anchors contracting a virus in the middle of a pandemic is not news, why is Ingraham covering it? Like Arroyo just said in this very segment, \u201cPeople are dying and losing their livelihoods.\u201d\nBut of course, the two went right back to the comedy portion of the COVID-19 segment by again mocking particular incidents and anchors, which included another prepackaged graphic that made fun of Anderson Cooper.",

From business interruption and supply chain disruption to event and travel cancellations, we are only just seeing the beginning stages of COVID-19's impact. These articles provide valuable insights on insurance coverage, preparation tips and more to help individuals and businesses reduce exposures as the virus spreads. Slideshow 6 categories of employment lawsuits to expect in the wake of COVID-19 By Emily Payne | April 24, 2020 at 12:00 AM | The original version of this story was published on BenefitsPRO X Your article was successfully shared with the contacts you provided. 6. Disparate impact layoffs claims\nFor many companies, layoffs and downsizing will be unavoidable in the comping months. What can be avoided, though, is claims of discrimination, if such layoffs are carefully and prudently planned.\n\u201dAs companies address the need for layoffs and furloughs, the disparate impact of decisions on who is retained and who is terminated will face scrutiny, opening the door to possible claims for age discrimination,\u201d Schmidt writes. 5. Employee medical privacy claims\nOne of your team members notifies you that they\u2019ve tested positive for COVID-19. What do you do? Do you share this information publicly with the rest of their team so they\u2019re aware of their own exposure? How you handle employees\u2019 medical information will undoubtedly come under careful scrutiny in the coming months.\n\u201cEmployee privacy claims are likely to follow as the manner in which companies handle sensitive information concerning employees\u2019 medical diagnosis is questioned,\u201d Schmidt writes. \u201cThis includes internal as well as external reporting. If employee records, normally maintained on a secured server, are accessed and stored outside of the normal environment, there are risks relating to unauthorized access to private information and resulting privacy claims.\u201d 4. ERISA claims\n401(k) plans have taken a major hit across the board, and some people will be wondering if their advisors should have been doing more to protect them against the loss. \u201cAny down market prompts greater scrutiny of past fiduciary decisions,\u201d Writes Schmidt, pointing to the impact that the recent verdict in Retirement Plans Committee of IBM v. Jander, will have. 3. Employee safety and claims\n\u201cCompanies have been required to balance urgent business needs with employee health and safety during the crisis,\u201d Schmidt writes. \u201cThere will likely be class actions relating to exposures to the virus in the workplace. In addition, the stress of the pandemic and resulting mental health needs will increase the likelihood of individual as well as class claims.\u201d 2. Wage & hour claims\nWith the sudden and unplanned switch to work-from-home arrangements, many companies may not have had time to adequately spell out policies and expectations for employees.\nWrites Schmidt: \u201cAs a result of employees working remotely, standard operating procedures and controls relating to meal and rest breaks have been disrupted. A lack of adequate recordkeeping and oversight increases the risk of wage and hour claims, including overtime pay. The use of personal equipment for business purposes triggers questions and claims relating to companies\u2019 reimbursement policies.\u201d Advertisement 1. WARN Act claims\nThe Workers Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act requires employers with at least 100 full-time workers who are laying off at least 50 workers during a 30-day period (\u201cPlant closing\u201d) to provide at least 60 days\u2019 notice before layoffs. But given the sudden shift in the economy and the mandatory closure or slowdown of businesses, as well as the day-to-day development related to coronavirus, 60 days is more than man employers can spare.\n\u201dThe announcement of layoffs will likely result in a number of claims relating to compliance with WARN Act and similar state laws, including questions of whether certain exemptions apply,\u201d Schmidt writes.\nTransitioning to a work-from-home model. Furloughing and laying off workers . Complying with new regulations from the CARES and Families First Coronavirus Response Acts. Protecting employees\u2019 personal medical information while ensuring the health and safety of the overall workforce.\nThese are just a few of the legal landmines employers are dealing with these days. The COVID-19 coronavirus and the resulting economic upheaval represent uncharted territory for many employers. As they grapple with balancing concern for employee safety while keeping business running, they\u2019ll be forced to make some unpleasant decisions. Undoubtedly, those decisions will be met with criticism and potential lawsuits.\nRecently, the family of a Walmart employee who died from COVID-19 filed a wrongful death suit against the retail giant, alleging the company ignored the man when he reported to his manager that he was feeling ill. Should the company have done more to ensure employees\u2019 safety?\n\u201cThe fact that there are only a handful of employee claims filed should not be read as indicative of a lack of future claims from employees,\u201d writes Kent Schmidt, a partner at Left Coast Law . \u201cThere is a general consensus that there will be many employee class actions.\u201d\nSchmidt expects that employment-related lawsuits will align with six broad categories, all of which employers should be aware of and consider as they plan ",

(\"Sirnaomics\"), a leading biopharmaceutical company in discovery and development of novel RNAi therapeutics, announced today that it has mobilized its research teams both in USA and China to develop novel RNAi-based prophylactics and therapeutics for treatment of patients suffering from Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) caused by the 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\nBased on U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the outbreak of respiratory illness that is caused by a novel coronavirus (termed \"2019-nCov\") and was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province , China , continues to spread. In addition to confirmed cases in multiple provinces in China (as of January 24, 2020 ), human-to-human infections with the virus have been confirmed in Thailand , Japan , Taiwan , South Korea , Singapore , Vietnam and USA . The total confirmed number of patients infected by 2019-nCoV is 929, with 26 deaths in Hubei Province , China .\nThe Sirnaomics R&D team has an established track record of using siRNA prophylactics and therapeutics to treat SARS coronavirus, H5N1 influenza and other respiratory viral infections, with multiple animal models including non-human primate. The team's expertise covers siRNA drug design (silencing the most critical viral genes), respiratory tract siRNA delivery formulation, large scale GMP drug production and clinical investigations. To fight against SARI caused by the 2019-nCoV infection, Sirnaomics team has already identified potentially potent siRNAs, specifically targeting the viral genes critical for the viral infection and replication. Collaborating with laboratories having cell culture models of 2019-nCoV infection, Sirnaomics expects to develop multiple siRNA drug candidates.\nPatrick Lu , PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sirnaomics, stated, \"This is a critical time for treating SARI caused by the 2019-nCoV to mitigate further spreading of the deadly disease. RNAi as a naturally evolved antiviral mechanism has been demonstrated in various in vitro and in vivo models. Our team's in-depth knowledge and experience using RNAi technology to fight respiratory viral infection in the previous SARS outbreak will add on to our antiviral weaponry to fight SARI. The unique siRNA drug design and chemical modification, respiratory specific siRNA delivery formulation, and the handheld nebulizer device are providing a clear pathway for developing novel siRNA therapeutics and prophylactics against 2019-nCoV infection.\"\nDavid Evans , Ph.D. Chief Scientific Officer of Sirnaomics, stated, \"Sirnaomics recognizes the need for rapid identification of a safe and effective way to treat this devasting disease.

        "content": "Dr. Mark Sircus, Ac., OMD, DM (P) (acupuncturist, doctor of oriental and pastoral medicine) is a prolific writer and author of some astounding medical and health-related books. Dr. Sircus\u2019s methods are based on medical science and long years of clinical experience, not only his own but experiences of doctors from around the world who have been practicing brilliant medicine. His books are heavily referenced, but the layperson finds little difficulty in understanding his presentation of medical topics. For many years Dr. Sircus has been researching into the human condition and into the causes of disease; he has distilled many of the divergent medical systems into a new form of medicine that he has coined Natural Allopathic Medicine. Natural Allopathic Medicine represents a new therapeutic principle that revolutionizes both allopathic and naturopathic medicine offering a radical shift in medical thought and practice. Dr. Sircus\u2019s protocol addresses foundational physiology. It focuses on pH management, cell voltage, magnesium and iodine medicine, cannabinoid medicine, carbon dioxide medicine, re-mineralization of the body, increasing oxygen transport and oxygenation of the tissues, opening up of blood vessels, saturation and healing of cells with concentrated nutrition via superfoods, breathing retraining, emotional transformation processing, detoxification and removal of heavy metals and radioactive particles. The exciting part of Dr. Sircus\u2019s protocol is that it is easy to learn and anyone can start implementing it even while being treated by other approaches. Secondly, with a recent medical breakthrough\u2014a legalized form of medical marijuana now available throughout the world\u2014Dr. Sircus\u2019s protocol is entirely legal. With the publication of Dr. Sircus\u2019s Treatment Essentials book, which actually teaches people to put into practice this medical approach, anyone will now have access to the information that will enable them to take charge of their own health. Dr. Sircus\u2019s approach is humanitarian because it pays attention to the majority who cannot afford expensive medical treatments or pharmaceutical drugs. With the Natural Allopathic Medicine protocol, people with limited funds can make use of the top three medicinals mentioned above\u2014magnesium chloride, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), and iodine\u2014to inexpensively treat most health problems. Add breathing retraining, CBD, superfoods, vitamin C, plenty of water good enough to be called a medicine, enough sun, daily magnesium massages and one will improve or cure almost any ailment.",

        "content": "It comes as the number of deaths in China has gone past 80 with 2,744 confirmed cases. However international experts continue to be sceptical about the official figures and the increasing rate of infection of the virus as it is now been transmitted by person to person infection. Overnight, in China, it is reported that half the new infections, of which nearly 60% were serious cases, where contracted outside Hubei province which has been in lockdown now since the middle of last week.\nThe Thai Public Health Minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, has strongly denied that the government is neglecting the safety of the Thai public in favour of the country\u2019s valuable tourism industry as public concern and alarm grows over the danger posed by what is an accelerating emergency in China which even the Chinese President described on Sunday as a \u2018grave\u2019 challenge. Minister Anutin again has insisted that he was confident that the government\u2019s Department of Disease Control can handle the emergency and that the situation, for now, is under control. The minister has also pointed to the need for a proportionate response to the threat. The Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul has denied that the government is prioritising the tourism industry but has argued that the response to the threat must be proportionate. He has again insisted that authorities are confident that the situation is currently under control as public concern in Thailand is mounting over grim reports from China where the outbreak is taking on horrifying proportions.\nThe public health minister, who insisted on Sunday that the threat of the Chinese coronavirus is under control, has pointed to the years of experience that the Department of Disease Control has in dealing with such outbreaks.\nHe has nevertheless pointed out that the government is in the process of ramping up measures to tackle the threat but felt that it was too early to be contemplating turning away tourists and travellers from China en masse.\nMinister Anutin has also pointed out that the prime minister has given specific instructions that the Ministry of Health and associated agencies be as transparent and open as possible with the public as the emergency progresses. Public criticism on social media of the government\u2019s response despite the minister\u2019s assurances\nHis comments come as there is rising public concern coupled with criticism of authorities online for putting Thailand\u2019s tourism industry ahead of public safety on the matter.\nThe minister has revealed that the number of infections detected in Thailand has risen to 8 but that 5 have already been discharged including Chinese visitors who have already returned home.\nCurrently, there are only three people in full quarantine. Public Health minister reveals that most suspected cases have been discharged from Thai hospitals\nThe minister said that there had been 84 suspected cases with new ones coming to light in recent hours in the provinces of Nakhon Sawan, Rayong and Chiang Mai.\nHe also revealed that only 39 of the 84 suspected cases remain in isolation with the rest having been discharged.\n\u2018China has imposed a lockdown. Hong Kong has suspended classes. Each country has its own conditions and plans to handle the situation. Thailand has done a really good job in handling a situation like this,\u2019 the minister said as he urged people not to panic. Visitors from Guangdong in southern China now being screened at Thai airports for the virus\nChinese tourists continue to arrive in Thailand with visitors from Guangdong province being screened with new checks also being imposed on visitors entering from Cambodia. Strongly denied claims the government was prioritising the tourism industry over public safety\nThe minister replied to a growing chorus of criticism with a number of trending hashtags on Twitter with hundreds of thousands of tweets from the public expressing concern over the situation.\nThe minister categorically denied that the government was prioritising tourism over public safety but also pointed to the possibility of further precautions and steps been taken as the threat is being constantly reviewed and managed.\nThis includes a national committee to coordinate the activities of government agencies.\n\u2018If it reaches a point where public health is in danger, we will take action,\u2019 the Public Health Minister insisted. \u2018Detecting infected patients is a good sign because it shows that our system is efficient.\u2019 Public concern over the grim news from China\nThe source of the public concern is easy to understand as matters across the border in central and southern China are growing decidedly grimmer.\nThe key concern among western medical experts is that China is downplaying the extent of the outbreak and more worryingly, that the transmission of the virus is growing more effective with person to person transmission. Outbreak could end up worse than SARS\u2013 lack of trust in Chinese authorities spooking concern\nOne public health expert, in recent days, has pointed out that this outbreak could more infectious that the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003 but with a lower mortality rate of 3% as compared to 11% for SARS. More or less infectious than SARS, a key question\nHowever, there is some disagreement as to whether this virus is more infectious with experts complaining that current information on the virus is based on preliminary and incomplete data. Some experts this week have suggested that this disease is more infections.\nThe World Health Organisation on January 23rd, however, was ambiguous suggesting that it was being contracted via person to person transmission by coughing and sneezing.\nThe WHO estimates the R0 (rate of infected people per carrier) for the current virus is somewhere between 1.4 and 2.5 which indicates how many people are infected by each sufferer. This would be compared to 2.0 to 4.0 for SARs which was reduced to 0.4 when strict measures were introduced to curb that virus outbreak in April 2003.\nThe WHO figure is based on an exploratory analysis but there is a view among some experts that this outbreak is spreading faster and is more difficult to contain. More cases being announced as serious\nWhat is being noticed is that more and more of the new infections have been revealed to involve more serious cases of the infection.\nAt this stage, experts do not know whether this is because of the inconsistency of figures coming from the communist government state apparatus in China or an infection that is growing more virulent and infectious with person to person transmission.\nIn Thailand, as of now, there has been no case yet of person to person transmission of the virus but that is no reason to be complacent. Some international experts warn that up to 100,000 people may already be infected in China\nAt present, the Chinese authorities have now confirmed 2,744 infections but this is rising sharply and with over 80 deaths. However, some sources among the international scientific community now believe that there may be over 100,000 people infected. Deaths now occurring outside Hubei province\nUp to Thursday, all the deaths were confined to the central Chinese province of Hubei. Of the 80 deaths confirmed by Chinese authorities to Monday, 76 were in the province Hubei which is home to the city Wuhan at the centre of the outbreak.\nHowever, figures from Chinese authorities overnight revealed that out of 769 new cases, only half of these were in the locked-down province containing 60 million people. Face masks mandatory in some provinces and cities\nThis raises concern for other provinces. Chinese officials have ordered that the wearing of face mask in public be made mandatory in Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces where over 160 people million live. Thai government considering the evacuation of nationals from Hubei province and Wuhan\nMeanwhile, the focus in Thailand has also switched to Thai students and spa workers stranded in Hubei province as other countries evacuate their nationals.\nIt is being reported that the Royal Thai Air Force has four C-130 aircraft on standby with medical teams to evacuate the Thai nationals from the ravaged area although reports from the Thai embassy in Beijing today point out that restaurants are still open in the province even though transport is restricted and inhabitants encouraged not to go out. McDonalds is closed in Hubei\nMcDonalds, the popular US hamburger chain, on Friday confirmed that it had suspended operations in 5 cities in Hubei province because of the current medical emergency. Chinese students told to delay return by 2 weeks\nThere is also concern about 7,000 Chinese students in Thai universities who have travelled home for the holidays to China. At present, they are being encouraged to delay their return for two weeks until the situation is clarified. Strengthened hygiene regimes in public places\nAs well as bolstering screening and reviewing the situation with a view to elevating precautionary measures, it is also being reported that Thai transport companies and public facilities such as shopping malls are being encouraged to introduce heightened hygiene regimes. Tourism Minister warns of a \u0e3f50 billion loss while Health Minster points to a proportionate response\nSo far, the Minister of Tourism and Sports, Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn has suggested the emergency has cost Thailand\u2019s economy \u0e3f50 billion in lost tourism revenue.\nHowever, for now, we are told, that is not the primary concern of the government. Minister of Public Health Mr Anutin is said to be focused on achieving an effective but proportionate response to the challenge.\n\u2018Sometimes we take proactive measures and sometimes we are on the defence. We have to make sure our responses don\u2019t affect people\u2019s daily lives and economic systems,\u2019 Minster Anutin said on Monday. \u2018We can control the situation and are confident in our ability to handle the crisis.\u2019",

AFRICAN countries are stepping up surveillance efforts following the emergence of the first suspected cases of the deadly Novel coronavirus outbreak in the continent this week.\nThe virus has made global headlines in recent weeks with Africa seemingly exempt but Ivory Coast on Monday became the first country in the continent to test a suspected coronavirus case, when a female student arrived at an airport in the capital Abidjan with suspicious symptoms.\nSince then, authorities in Ethiopia have quarantined four students suspected of carrying the virus.\nKenya has also isolated a citizen-who also travelled from China- for having symptoms of the coronavirus.\nThere has been a noticeable flight of African students based in China returning to the continent as authorities in the Asian nation battle the disease.\nAfrica is also vulnerable to the spread of the coronavirus owing to the volume of trade and travel between Asia and the continent.\nBefore the suspected cases in Ethiopia, Ivory Coast and Kenya, the virus that broke out in China had spread to the rest of Asia, Australia, Europe and North America but authorities are leaving nothing to chance.\nThey are wary of the risk of the current risk of importation of cases of the virus from Wuhan City, the epicentre of the virus that as of the middle of this week left at least 106 people dead.\nSouth Africa has enhanced surveillance of all travelers from Asia, especially China considering most BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) business executives are from China.\nThe surveillance has been beefed up at the country\u2019s ports of entry, particularly the Oliver Reginald Tambo (O.R.Tambo) and Cape Town International Airports, which are the only gateways with direct flights from Asia.\n\u201cSouth Africans are assured that measures are in place to detect, manage and contain any cases of Novel Coronavirus should it come to our shores,\u201d said Popo Maja, the spokesperson of the national Department of Health.\nPort health professionals routinely conduct temperature screening for all international travelers.\nWhile the World Health Organization (WHO) has not recommended any restriction of travel or trade, South African authorities have advised travellers to Wuhan to avoid contact with animals.\nThe majority of the coronavirus cases were linked to a seafood, poultry and live wildlife market in Wuhan City, suggesting that the virus has a possible animal origin.\nTravellers have also been advised to practice good hand hygiene and cough etiquette in order to reduce the risk of infection with respiratory viruses.\nIn addition to enhanced surveillance, South Africa has embarked on a campaign to empower public and private health workers on the diagnosis and response to a possible outbreak.\n\u201cProvinces have activated outbreak response teams and are on high alert to detect and manage inadvertent cases that may arrive in the country,\u201d said Maja.\nIn Angola, the government is implementing preventive measures in ports, land borders and overcrowded passenger stops.\nThe Ministry of Health is leading the exercise that mainly consists of the installation of thermometers in the above mentioned places, mostly the Quatro de Fevereiro International Airport, which is the main international airport of Angola.\n\u201cThe installation of thermometers at the airport will help promptly identify changes in body temperature and pay special attention to arriving passengers,\u201d Minister of Health, S\u00edlvia Lutucuta, said.\nThe ministry has established multidisciplinary medical teams at the main airport to carry out necessary controls in all areas of the airport.\nOn their part, citizens must practise good hygiene such as washing their hands.\nGovernment has encouraged them to pay attention to the virus\u2019 most common symptoms, which include cough, fever and breathing difficulties.\nLutucuta assured that all ministerial departments and the private health sector were working on necessary measures.\nMozambique is also on high alert, government official assured, adding staff at all the country\u2019s health facilities were in readiness.\n\u201cWe have strengthened the screening services at the points of entry,\u201d said Rosa Marlene Cuco, the National Director of Public Health.\nThe Ministry of Health, she said, was working with the Foreign Affairs ministry and the National Immigration Service to obtain details of travellers, especially those going to China.\n\u201cPeople travelling overseas should take great care in contact with anyone showing possible symptoms of infection. Any traveller returning from countries at risk of coronavirus must carry out a self-diagnosis before entering Mozambique,\u201d Cuco advised.\nA Mozambique student in China is suspected to be carrying the virus and has reportedly been prevented from leaving the Chinese city where he is spending the holidays.\nAuthorities said this was a precautionary measure.\nTanzania issued a stern statement against members of the public overlooking suspected cases of the virus.\n\u201cThe ministry warns the public on this,\u201d said the Ministry of Health spokesperson, Gerald Chami.\nMinister Ummy Mwalimu\u2019s health ministry stated it would boost airport surveillance for passengers travelling from China and other affected countries.\nTanzania has embarked on an awareness drive among health workers and health workers, with a major focus on entry points.\nQuarantine facilities are being considered.\nDespite WHO classifying Zambia as a low risk country, the government has boosted surveillance of the killer disease at entry points across the country, mainly airports.\nChilufya, the Minister of Health, confirmed the proceedings.\nThe use of thermal scanners for temperature monitoring on all arrival passengers is some of the measures.\nChilufya National Public Health Emergency Operations Centre was on high alert.\n\u201cThe government under is committed to addressing this challenge,\u201d the minister said.\nAlready, Zambia is at risk of the world\u2019s second worst outbreak of Ebola that has claimed the lives of more than 2 200 people since August 2018 in the northern neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo .\nMalawi has also set up screening procedures for people arriving from overseas.\nCoronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. They can be spread from human to human.\nAmong the most deadly in recent years are the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).\nAn outbreak of SARS, which also started in China in 2002, resulted in more than 700 deaths globally.\nSince 2012, 850 deaths have been documented from MERS.\n",

The photos show students drinking Corona beers, and a caption under one of the images reads \u201cinfect me daddy.\u201d\nAfter the article was published, university principal Patrick Deane issued a statement warning students of an \u201cinsidious social challenge already emerging amongst us\u201d and urging them to treat each other with dignity and respect.\n\u201cIgnorantly ostracizing Chinese and Asian students will rip apart the beautiful tapestry of our international campus and must be repudiated by everyone,\u201d Deane said in the statement, which did not directly reference the party.\nA university spokesperson said the statement was \u201cnot specifically issued in response to the regrettable events on the weekend, however it illustrates how important it is that the message is reinforced.\u201d\n\u201cPrincipal Deane\u2019s statement was intended to remind our community not to fall prey to fear and misinformation, and to make every effort to support each other with dignity and respect,\u201d spokesperson Mark Erdman said in a statement.\nInstances of racism against Chinese-Canadians have been widely reported following the novel coronavirus outbreak. The same day the coronavirus-themed party was reportedly held, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned Canadians against discrimination.\n\"There is no place in our country for discrimination driven by fear or misinformation,\" Trudeau said at a Lunar New Year event in Toronto on Saturday. \"This is not something Canadians will ever stand for.\"\nInternational reports of anti-Chinese racism have been on the rise.

WAHO fully supports WHO\u2019s recommendations to countries regarding active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, and contact tracing to prevent further spread of this outbreak.\u201c\nCoordination with ECOWAS Member States WAHO is coordinating with Member States to share real-time information on the outbreak, enhance communication between countries and strengthen countries\u2019 surveillance capacity, including early detection of suspected cases through thermal camera surveillance at international borders.\n\u201cOne such suspected case arriving Abidjan airport recently was immediately detected and isolated and tests are now being performed to confirm whether this is a case of coronavirus or not. WAHO has also implemented a regional laboratory network for access to rapid biological diagnostic facilities by Member States, and has a standby Regional Rapid Response Team to support countries if required.\u201d\nWAHO advised against direct unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals when visiting markets. At all times, avoid eating raw or undercooked meat. Raw meat, milk or animal organs should be handled with care, to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods.\nNo fewer than 81 persons have died from the Novel Coronavirus in China, and 3,000 persons have been confirmed to be infected globally with the virus out of which 2744 cases are in China alone.",

We can eventually take a long view of how to manage and prevent epidemics, but today practitioners and public health authorities need actionable information as soon as possible. We are therefore putting in place a set of practices that we will apply to all submitted manuscripts describing the 2019-nCoV outbreak. \u2022 We expect authors to share important information with public health authorities as early as possible. In the case of the current coronavirus outbreak, we will, with authors\u2019 approval, share appropriate manuscripts in confidence with the World Health Organization. We also encourage authors to submit their work for posting on preprint servers. \u2022 We will rapidly evaluate submitted manuscripts and, if we plan to publish them, will expedite all editorial steps to make them available as quickly as possible. We encourage authors to share with other researchers the original data that underlie all reports on 2019-nCoV that we publish. \u2022 As with all work with immediate public health significance, articles about the coronavirus outbreak will be made freely available at NEJM.org from the day of publication. A special page has been created at NEJM.org for all coronavirus articles ( www.NEJM.org/coronavirus ), along with links to essential resources for clinicians. \u2022 Because we cannot publish everything we receive, we will, on manuscript submission, offer authors the opportunity for rapid transfer of their manuscript to other participating journals, with reviewer comments when available. The rapid pace of infectious disease outbreaks can be frightening. Our aim is to transparently bring readers the best information available in a highly expedited manner.

        "content": "Anxiety over coronavirus outbreak remains high mainly due to increased interaction between Kenyans and the Chinese. With two daily non-stop flights between Nairobi and Guangzhou, China, the panic in Kenya may be understandable. But while Kenyans are worried over importation of the virus from China, evidence shows the threat of an outbreak is even bigger from within. Local camels Scientific evidence shows six of the seven known human corona viruses, including the fatal SARS and MERS, have recently been confirmed in Kenya. Corona viruses, local health experts say, present a real danger especially due to climate change and increasing incidence of Kenyans eating illegal and uninspected game meat. In October last year, researchers from Wuhan Institute of Virology, China, and Kenya\u2019s Agriculture Ministry found local camels positive for MERS-CoV and HKU8rCoV. Subscribe Now \u00bb \u201cFor the first time, we demonstrate the presence of a HKU8rCoV infection in camels,\u201d says the study. Another study by researchers Ying Tao and Suxiang Tong of CDC last year confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV in local bats.\u201cOur study demonstrates that the SARS-related CoVs that were identified from Rhinolophus bats in China and Europe were also present in Kenyan Rhinolophus bats,\u201d says the study in the journal Microbiology Resource Announcements . In 2015 a study involving, among others the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), Nairobi, researchers reported MERS-CoV in local camels. A year later, the Ministry of Health, ILRI and others in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases reported two people in Garissa and Tana River counties testing positive for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The authors however said the infected people neither showed signs nor felt any illness and had not been a threat to public health.\u201cThis is the first time MERS-CoV antibodies have been detected in humans in Africa who had no known connection to the Middle East,\u201d wrote Susan Macmillan, ILRI head of public communications. Circulating widely The Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) has also confirmed less severe corona virus-related pneumonia among children attending hospitals in Kilifi County.\u201cIn this coastal Kenya setting, HCoV-NL63 exhibited low prevalence in hospital paediatric pneumonia admissions,\u201d wrote KEMRI scientists in the study published in 2018 in Journal of Infectious Diseases . In the same year a large study by United States Army Medical Research Unit-Kenya and several other local research institutions, investigated 10,000 nasal passage samples collected from local hospitals. The study confirmed that sub-types of the four less severe corona virus, 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 were circulating widely in Kenya. Following the increasing threat of animal disease jumping to humans, in 2011 the ministries of agriculture and health as well as the Kenya Wildlife Services, created the Kenya Zoonotic Disease Unit. But a recent evaluation by Kemri, ILRI and Busia and Bungoma county governments says the initiative \u201clacks integration between the various sectors, leading to disease under-reporting and inefficiencies.\u201d ",

        "content": "Like every issue of consequence, in our Age of Incomprehension, opinion about the truth concerning the Corona virus outbreak is divided. Either China is taking all prudent steps, the virus, while transmissible, has a low mortality rate and the West, with its travel bans, is over-reacting in a vaguely racist manner, or China has the virus far from contained, we don\u2019t know just how transmissible it is nor its mortality rate because the figures from China can\u2019t be trusted and therefore travel bans are a wise precaution.\nIf travel bans to and from the infected parts of China turn out to have been justified then one country in particular may be worth watching, Ethiopia. Ethiopia\u2019s Bole International airport is the main African gateway to and from China. On average 1500 passengers per day arrive from China every day. Ethiopia scans them all for symptoms which essentially means taking their temperature.\nMany of those passengers then fly on to other parts of Africa where Chinese companies are doing business. These are 2018 figures courtesy of Brookings .\nThe three main areas of Chinese business in Africa are transport, which generally means building airports and railways, energy which means building power stations and grids and metals which means mines.\nOne of the airports the Chinese funded and built is Bole International Airport in Ethiopia.\nThe flights from China arriving at Bole International come from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Hong Kong. Just yesterday the Chinese government added China\u2019s 5th largest city Guangzhou to its list of locked down quarantined cities. Which strikes me as news. For Guangzhou to have been quarantined means it must already have a large number of cases. Guangzhou is not near to Wuhan, the source of the Corona virus outbreak. It is near to Hong Kong.\nIt is linked to both by high speed rail and internal air travel. Guangzhou airport is in fact the third busiest in China and the 13th busiest in the world handling over 65 million passengers per year.\nSo\u2026 the spread of the Corona virus in Guangzhou has got so serious that the Chinese government has quarantined it. Yet till now flights from there to Ethiopia were running. Of course I have no idea how many passengers were actually on those flights nor where they might have originated from. But the rail and air links from Wuhan and other cities to Guangzhou and the fact that Guangzhou is therefore the hub to which any workers going to Africa would have passed through, does raise a few questions. Remember, 1500 per day on average (meaning in \u2018normal times\u2019 which these are not) through Bole international from China alone.\nThe Ethiopian authorities have been scanning arrivals. But we know that one of the things which has made this virus difficult to contain is that people can carry it and spread it for up to 14 days before they show symptoms. This is one of the reasons the Chinese authorities, despite draconian measures, have failed to contain it. If the Chinese authorities have failed, how confident should we be the Ethiopian authorities and those in the other countries Chinese workers have travelled on to, will succeed?\nI have no idea and frankly neither does any one else. Which is surely the relevant point.\nWestern Counties have so far contained the virus and I think it likely they will continue to do so, simply because if you catch a virus outbreak early, you can . Viruses multiply and spread roughly according to a sigmoid curve. This plots the number of infections. At the start of an outbreak the curve is shallow simply because the numbers involved are small.\nDouble from 2 to 4 or 4 to 8 and its not that many new cases. That\u2019s the shallow part of the curve, the beginning of the outbreak. As the curve steepens its not that the virus is increasing its infection rate. The rate will not have changed at all. But the numbers involved grows. Still only doubling, but doubling from 8 to 16 to 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384\u2026you see the problem. Its nothing more than the law of big numbers. That law is what we are seeing in China in the quarantined cities. The question is IF and it still is, thankfully, an IF, some of the Chinese workers have carried the virus to Ethiopia or the African countries they work in, will those countries be able to contain it while they can, while the numbers are small?\nI hope so.\n\n",

        "content": "The second meeting of the Emergency Committee convened by the WHO Director-General under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) regarding the outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV in the People\u2019s Republic of China, with exportations to other countries, took place on Thursday, 30 January 2020, from 13:30 to 18:35 Geneva time (CEST). The Committee\u2019s role is to give advice to the Director-General, who makes the final decision on the determination of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Committee also provides public health advice or suggests formal Temporary Recommendations as appropriate.\nProceedings of the meeting\nThe Director-General welcomed the Committee and thanked them for their support. He turned the meeting over to the Chair, Professor Didier Houssin.\nProfessor Houssin also welcomed the Committee and gave the floor to the Secretariat.\nA representative of the department of Compliance, Risk management, and Ethics briefed the Committee members on their roles and responsibilities.\nCommittee members were reminded of their duty of confidentiality and their responsibility to disclose personal, financial, or professional connections that might be seen to constitute a conflict of interest. Each member who was present was surveyed and no conflicts of interest were judged to be relevant to the meeting. There were no changes since the previous meeting.\nThe Chair then reviewed the agenda for the meeting and introduced the presenters.\nRepresentatives of the Ministry of Health of the People\u2019s Republic of China reported on the current situation and the public health measures being taken. There are now 7711 confirmed and 12167 suspected cases throughout the country. Of the confirmed cases, 1370 are severe and 170 people have died. 124 people have recovered and been discharged from hospital.\nThe WHO Secretariat provided an overview of the situation in other countries. There are now 82 cases in 18 countries. Of these, only 7 had no history of travel in China. There has been human-to-human transmission in 3 countries outside China. One of these cases is severe and there have been no deaths.\nAt its first meeting, the Committee expressed divergent views on whether this event constitutes a PHEIC or not. At that time, the advice was that the event did not constitute a PHEIC, but the Committee members agreed on the urgency of the situation and suggested that the Committee should continue its meeting on the next day, when it reached the same conclusion.\nThis second meeting takes place in view of significant increases in numbers of cases and additional countries reporting confirmed cases.\nConclusions and advice\nThe Committee welcomed the leadership and political commitment of the very highest levels of Chinese government authorities, their commitment to transparency, and the efforts made to investigate and contain the current outbreak. China quickly identified the virus and shared its sequence, so that other countries could diagnose it quickly and protect themselves, which has resulted in the rapid development of diagnostic tools.\nThe very strong measures the country has taken include daily contact with WHO and comprehensive multi-sectoral approaches to prevent further spread. It has also taken public health measures in other cities and provinces; is conducting studies on the severity and transmissibility of the virus and sharing data and biological material. The country has also agreed to work with other countries who need their support. The measures China has taken are good not only for that country but also for the rest of the world.\nThe Committee acknowledged the leading role of WHO and its partners.\nThe Committee also acknowledged that there are still many unknowns, cases have now been reported in five WHO regions in one month, and human-to-human transmission has occurred outside Wuhan and outside China.\nThe Committee believes that it is still possible to interrupt virus spread, provided that countries put in place strong measures to detect disease early, isolate and treat cases, trace contacts, and promote social distancing measures commensurate with the risk. It is important to note that as the situation continues to evolve, so will the strategic goals and measures to prevent and reduce spread of the infection. The Committee agreed that the outbreak now meets the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and proposed the following advice to be issued as Temporary Recommendations.\nThe Committee emphasized that the declaration of a PHEIC should be seen in the spirit of support and appreciation for China, its people, and the actions China has taken on the frontlines of this outbreak, with transparency, and, it is to be hoped, with success. In line with the need for global solidarity, the committee felt that a global coordinated effort is needed to enhance preparedness in other regions of the world that may need additional support for that.\nAdvice to WHO\nThe Committee welcomed a forthcoming WHO multidisciplinary technical mission to China, including national experts. The mission should review and support efforts to investigate the animal source of the outbreak, the clinical spectrum of the disease and its severity, the extent of human-to-human transmission in the community and in healthcare facilities, and efforts to control the outbreak. This mission will provide information to the international community to aid in understanding the situation and its impact and enable sharing of experience and successful measures.\nThe Committee wished to re-emphasize the importance of studying the possible source, to rule out ongoing hidden transmission.\nThe Committee also emphasized the need for enhanced surveillance in regions outside Hubei, including pathogen genomic sequencing, to understand whether local cycles of transmission are occurring.\nThe Committee would welcome strong leadership to engage in the discussion about proportionality in control measures, particularly with regard to potentially damaging travel and trade restrictions.\nWHO should continue to use its networks of technical experts to assess how best this outbreak can be contained globally.\nWHO should provide intensified support for preparation and response, especially in vulnerable countries and regions.\nMeasures to ensure rapid development and access to potential vaccines, diagnostics, antiviral medicines and other therapeutics for low- and middle-income countries should be developed.\nWHO should continue to provide all necessary technical and operational support to respond to this outbreak, including with its extensive networks of partners and collaborating institutions, to implement a comprehensive risk communication strategy, and to allow for the advancement of research and scientific developments in relation to this novel coronavirus.\nWHO should continue to explore the advisability of creating an intermediate level of alert between the binary possibilities of PHEIC or no PHEIC, in a way that does not require reopening negotiations on the text of the IHR (2005).\nThe Director-General declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a PHEIC, accepted the Committee\u2019s advice and issued this advice as Temporary Recommendations under the IHR (2005).\nTo the People\u2019s Republic of China\nContinue to:\nImplement a comprehensive risk communication strategy to regularly inform the population on the evolution of the outbreak, the prevention and protection measures for the population, and the response measures taken for its containment.\nEnhance rational public health measures for containment of the current outbreak.\nEnsure the resilience of the health system and protect the health workforce.\nEnhance surveillance and active case finding across China.\nCollaborate with WHO and partners to conduct investigations to understand the epidemiology and the evolution of this outbreak and measures to contain it.\nShare full data on all human cases.\nStrengthen the efforts to identify a zoonotic source of the outbreak, and particularly the potential for ongoing circulation with WHO as soon as it becomes available.\nConduct exit screening at international airports and ports, with the aim of early detection of symptomatic travelers for further evaluation and treatment, while minimizing interference with international traffic.\nTo all countries\nIt is expected that further international exportation of cases may appear in any country. Thus, all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of 2019-nCoV infection, and to share full data with WHO. Technical advice is available on the WHO website .\nCountries are reminded that they are legally required to share information with WHO under the IHR (2005).\nCountries should place particular emphasis on reducing human infection, prevention of secondary transmission and international spread, and contributing to the international response though multi-sectoral communication and collaboration and active participation in increasing knowledge on the virus and the disease, as well as advancing research.\nThe Committee acknowledged that, in general, evidence has shown that restricting the movement of people and goods during public health emergencies may be ineffective and may divert resources from other interventions. Further, restrictions may interrupt needed aid and technical support, may disrupt businesses, and may have negative effects on the economies of countries affected by the emergencies.\nHowever, in certain specific circumstances, measures that restrict the movement of people may prove temporarily useful, such as in settings with limited response capacities and capabilities, or where there is high intensity of transmission among vulnerable populations.\nIn such situations, countries should perform risk and cost-benefit analyses before implementing such restrictions to assess whether the benefits would outweigh the drawbacks. Countries must inform WHO about any travel measures taken, as required by the IHR. Countries are cautioned against actions that promote stigma or discrimination, in line with the principles of Article 3 of the IHR.\nThe Committee asked the Director-General to provide further advice on these matters and, if necessary, to make new case-by-case recommendations, in view of this rapidly evolving situation.\nTo the global community\nAs this is a new coronavirus, and it has been previously shown that similar coronaviruses required substantial efforts to enable regular information sharing and research, the global community should continue to demonstrate solidarity and cooperation, in compliance with Article 44 of the IHR (2005), in supporting each other on the identification of the source of this new virus, its full potential for human-to-human transmission, preparedness for potential importation of cases, and research for developing necessary treatment.\nProvide support to low- and middle-income countries to enable their response to this event, as well as to facilitate access to diagnostics, potential vaccines and therapeutics.\nUnder Article 43 of the IHR, States Parties implementing additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic (refusal of entry or departure of international travellers, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods, and the like, or their delay, for more than 24 hours) are obliged to send to WHO the public health rationale and justification within 48 hours of their implementation. WHO will review the justification and may request countries to reconsider their measures. WHO is required to share with other States Parties the information about measures and the justification received.\nThe Emergency Committee will be reconvened within three months or earlier, at the discretion of the Director-General.\nThe Director-General thanked the Committee for its work.\n",

The virus was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31 and has been examined since then. Chinese scientists have linked the disease to a family of viruses known as coronaviruses which include lethal SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). On Friday, the French authorities confirmed three cases within the country, the first known cases in Europe. The same day, Australia announced its first confirmed case, and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced a second case in the United States, this time in Chicago. According to Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the CDC is currently testing more than 60 patients for possible infections in over 20 states. On Saturday, the State Department asked US Consulate employees in Wuhan to leave the city.\nScientists have not yet fully understood the destructive potential of the new 2019 nCoV virus. Researchers and researchers are just beginning to find out where it comes from, how it is transmitted and how widespread it has been.\nOn Saturday, the number of cases in China and abroad rose to over 1,900. The Chinese authorities also confirmed that healthcare professionals have been infected with the virus, suggesting that human-to-human transmission is possible.\nThe authorities take measures to prevent the spread of 2019-nCoV. On Thursday a special WHO committee decided that it was too early to explain a health emergency on a global level. On Saturday, however, Hong Kong declared a citywide emergency as the highest warning level. All official Chinese New Year celebrations have been canceled and school holidays have been extended until February 17th. Also on Saturday, China announced that it would run out of travel Monday for some of its citizens traveling abroad, including suspending tour groups and temporarily stopping the sale of flight and hotel packages.\nThe situation is developing rapidly. We've put together everything we know about the mystery virus, what's next for researchers, and what steps you can take to reduce your risk.\nNow Playing: Deadly Corona Virus Detected in the USA\n1:41 What is a corona virus?\nCoronaviruses belong to a family known as Coronaviridae and look like spiked rings under an electron microscope. They are named after these spines, which form a halo around their viral envelope.\nCoronaviruses contain an RNA strand in their shell and cannot multiply without entering living cells and hijacking their machinery. The spikes on the viral envelope help them bind to cells, which helps them find a way in. It's like opening the door with C4. Inside, they transform the cell into a virus factory and use their molecular conveyor belt to produce more viruses that are then dispatched. The virus progeny infect other cells and the cycle starts again.\nThese types of viruses typically occur in animals, which range from farm animals and domestic animals to wild animals such as bats. When jumping to people, they can cause fever, respiratory problems, and inflammation in the lungs. Such viruses can cause serious respiratory diseases in immunocompromised people such as the elderly or people with HIV-AIDS.\nExtremely pathogenic coronaviruses stood behind SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS and could easily be transmitted from person to person. SARS, which occurred in the early 2000s, infected more than 8,000 people and resulted in nearly 800 deaths. MERS, which emerged in the early 2010s, infected nearly 2,500 people and resulted in more than 850 deaths. Where did the virus come from?\nThe virus appears to have its origins in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, a Chinese city about 650 miles south of Beijing where more than 11 million people live. Fish and meat from other animals such as bats and snakes are sold on the market. The Wuhan market was closed on January 1st.\nMarkets have been involved in the development and spread of viral diseases in previous epidemics, and a large majority of people have confirmed that they have been infected with this corona virus in the past few weeks. The market seems to be an integral part of the puzzle, but researchers need to do a number of experiments and tests to confirm the virus's origin.\n\"Testing animals in the Wuhan area, including sampling from markets, will provide more information,\" said Raina MacIntyre, director of the Biosafety Research Program at the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales.\nA report by a Chinese research team in the Journal of Medical Virology on Wednesday indicated that snakes were the most likely wildlife reservoir for 2019-nCoV. The work examined the genetic code of the virus and compared it to that of two types of snakes, the multi-volume krait and the Chinese cobra. The investigation showed that the snake's genetic code is very similar to the virus.",

But I spent more time on my previous post than I had planned. So I will make this more brief.\nOver the past several years I have come to see just how the mainstream news media have become mostly repeaters of official government press releases. It\u2019s mainly propaganda, as we have seen and continue to see with the coverage of the 2016 election-Russia investigation and this impeachment farce. The media are the same with medical issues, in their being spokespeople for the pharmaceutical companies.\nSo, I really want to link to Jon Rappoport\u2019s two recent posts that address these issues, on the latest virus, the \u201ccorona\u201d virus. Those two posts are: China virus epidemic \u2013 the Gong Show on roller skates , and on the man who mushed the SARS dud now pushing new Chinese virus . Very good information and insight, in my opinion.\nHe makes reference to how in the past such as with SARS the media would not disclose that many cases of \u201cSARS\u201d were really patients with flu-like symptoms but who did not test positive for the \u201cSARS\u201d virus.\nRappoport brings up how medical and government officials don\u2019t seem to want to look at an area\u2019s sanitation and water systems, which are very important in these issues. There are also areas of malnutrition, in which a common problem is the compromised immune systems of many in the population, in which toxic vaccines and other pharmaceutical drugs are killing them.\nBut, \u201cTHE VIRUS\u201d is what needs to be obsessed with. In these \u201cepidemics,\u201d many of those suffering don\u2019t actually test positive for the virus in question. They have flu-like symptoms. And one reason some of the people with the sicknesses actually die \u2014 and I did hear a newscaster mention this, I couldn\u2019t believe a little truth was told \u2014 is because those people already had other serious medical conditions.\nSo, people with medical conditions should be as well-nourished as possible, for prevention.\nBut in China, a country with an ultra-authoritarian government that already keeps the masses in fear of the regime with the \u201csocial credit score,\u201d etc., the government is closing down whole cities? Those rulers are even worse control freaks than the power-addicted people in Washington.",

Last summer, the US put sanctions on a number of Chinese Tanker owners.

        "content": "The Chinese economy has dominated the world over the last 10 years, which has reached second place in the world after US with an estimated size of KD 4.2 trillion, with an annual growth rate of more than 6.2%. Such fast growth of Chinese trades is due to the effective strategy depending on- produce more and competitive price. Perhaps this rapid growth in the size of the Chinese economy has a significant impact on the rest of the world markets. As a result, the Chinese market has surpassed the world's largest economies such as Japan, Germany, India, and even catching up with the US dominated economy. Corona virus at attaching the most important world\u2019s economy, started on Jan. 2020, which will affect the global trade movement. The epidemic is one of the greatest risks that may cripple trade and economy during the current period, as Wuhan city located in China, is one of the pillars of the Chinese economy, accounting for about 78% of China's export volume to the world's countries. The city, which has been classified as the place of the Corona virus, accounts for about 33% of China GDP. Therefore, the decline in demand for oil and its derivatives because of this economic recession has affected the movement of the oil market and prices around the world, which is expected to exit nearly 3 million barrels from the market - 20% of China's total demand. The impact of Corona on the global technology industry will have an impact on the global technology industry, especially if we know that China alone accounts for about 21% of global IT systems. The impact of the Corona virus on investor confidence in the Shanghai Stock Exchange, from which investments equivalent to KD 130 billion as of the preparation of this report evaporated, with a sharp decline of 9%, the sharpest since the financial meltdown in June 2015. Preliminary results also point to the beginning of the recession within China, thanks to the closure of many retail stores of various global companies in China, thereby increasing unemployment. The virus also has an impact on world tourism, of which the Chinese people make up 150 million people, which will undoubtedly affect transport and hotel traffic around the world. The impact of this risk on the domestic market in Kuwait is also significant, as The State of Kuwait is heavily dependent on the volume of trade with China. According to the 2019 data, Kuwait's total exports were KD 19.6 billion, of which China accounted for only about 1.7%. While total imports of goods to Kuwait were about 10.1 billion Kuwaiti dinars, Chinese products account edited at about 18.8%, which means that the Kuwaiti market will be affected by these risks if the presence of the Corona virus continues and no solution to this problem is found. As for the value of imports from China to Kuwait, the results indicate that it amounted to about KD 1.9 billion, with an estimated growth rate of about 7.6% year-on-year. The following table shows the volume of exports and imports from/ to the People's Republic of China - to the State of Kuwait. As described in the above table, Kuwait relies on the Chinese market to export its goods, which are valued at KD 322.7 million, which is one of the most important markets targeting Kuwait to sell its products there. Nevertheless, Kuwait relies on the rest of the world's different markets for the sale of products, particularly oil and its derivatives. The following table shows the most important markets that Kuwait is targeting for the sale of its goods, which may benefit from the presence of this commercial risk - the Corona virus - in increasing the volume of Kuwaiti exports to it: As for the impact of the Corona virus on goods imported into Kuwait, this will be significant as outlined in this report, with a ratio of up to 18.8% and a value of goods ranging from KD 1.9 billion. The following figure shows the most prominent countries on which The State of Kuwait relies for its various goods, notably the People's Republic of China: Finally, the economic impact of this virus on Kuwait may continue to lead to the performance of agreements concluded with the People's Republic of China in 2018, which include defense industries, e-commerce, investment promotion, as well as cooperation in the field of communications. On the other hand, Bloomberg estimated the losses of the global economy due to the Corona virus at about 160 billion USD\u2014 about 50 billion KD - amid an expected slowdown in global growth for the coming years. Perhaps the alternative to that recession in Chinese markets would be greater activity for one of the world's most promising countries, with India, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, or returning its share to the US. The transition to the continuing corona virus crisis depends on China. ",

        "content": "Please keep China in your prayers. The unprecedented efforts to contain the Corona virus may bring rapid success, I hope, but also bring great hardship to millions for a time. The challenges for those living in fully locked-down cities like Wuhan, Huangguang, and Ezhou may be enormous. But even in areas where the virus is not raging, like the beautiful, modern metropolises of Shanghai and Hangzhou, life can be difficult. People coming home from travel, like two American friends of mine who just returned to Shanghai from Australia, or a European friend who just got back to Hangzhou from a visit in Shanghai, are finding that strict regulations make them prisoners in their own apartment as the government requires quarantine for travelers. That's if you are lucky enough to get home at all -- my friend in Hangzhou said that she got home just one day before a ban on travelers entering the city went into effect. I don't know how accurate that is, so I'm just reporting what she understands.\nIn Shanghai, people returning on Sunday and hoping to start work on Monday are in for disappointment and frustration. It may be one or two weeks before they can go back to work, depending on local rules. Once again, even while living temporarily overseas, the wisdom of having food storage and basic supplies in reserve is manifest, though quarantined residents may be able to go to the local market for essentials or have them delivered.\nOne man in Shanghai desperately needed to get his new passport that was sent by DHL to Shanghai, but had not been delivered to him for a number of days because DHL was largely shut down due to virus fears. It was only by going to DHL offices and \"crying\" for hours in front of the building that he finally got the attention of workers there who dug around in a pile of undelivered packages and found his passport, giving him time to get to the airport with just two hours to spare before his flight out of the country. Without that, he would have been in violation of Chinese law with an expired visa. You don't want to violate visa rules in any foreign country.\nSuch tales, though, may be nothing compared to the sorrows of those who are trapped in places they don't belong, without resources and friends, unable to leave. Or even local Wuhan residents struggling with the challenges of living life under a lockdown with so much uncertainty, in spite of valiant efforts now to provide support and services. An American trapped in Wuhan did manage to get a seat on a plane out organized by the US government, but the problem was getting to the airport, some 30 miles away from his home. A few weeks ago that would have been easy: just take a taxi. But taxis in Wuhan have been shut down except for a handful dedicated to taking patients to the hospitals, but this requires a complex process of getting approval from the local government committees for each region of town and there's no chance of getting a ride to the airport. With no feasible way to get to the airport, the man missed the flight and his seat was given to someone else. Fortunately, he had a second passport with Germany, and was able to get on the evacuation flight for Germany, a nation that kindly sent a bus to give German citizens rides to the airport. (Congratulation to those of you who recognize the many virtues of having a second passport. When things go crazy in your home country, it's nice to have another option.)\nIn spite of China now going all out to contain the virus, there seems to be widespread anger toward China and the Chinese people. There are accusations that China did not act quickly enough or still is not doing enough. But Chinese people are also experiencing blame and anger. Hotels, shops, and restaurants in some areas are turning away Chinese people. Rudeness and xenophobic hysteria abound in some hearts. As I left Asia a few days ago, after a two-week virus-free exile in Vietnam before I began a business trip to the US for an R&D project in Minneapolis (I just love the University of Minnesota, by the way!), I read a front-page article in the New York Times on my flight from Hanoi to Seoul and was pained to see further evidence of the worldwide anger toward China. Motoko Rich's Feb. 1-2, 2020 article, \"Global Xenophobia Follows Virus.\" See also MarketWatch's \" \u2018No Chinese allowed\u2019: Racism and fear are now spreading along with the coronavirus \" from Feb. 3. This is a tough time to be Chinese. The video below from a Chinese man in Florence, Italy reminds us of the humanity of those facing prejudice because a virus originated in their country.\nSome say there's a deja vu sense to this virus, which is causing so much hysteria around the globe. But there's reason for the hysteria: the virus has left China, and now has killed people elsewhere in the world, including (as of Feb. 4) Hong Kong (1 death) and Philippines (1 death), etc., etc., etc., for a total of, well, two deaths so far outside of China . But in China, nearly 500 people have died, so the death toll is on its way to reaching that of the worldwide 2009 influenza pandemic with the H1N1 virus. Well, on its way to some degree, I suppose. The H1N1 virus that started in the Americas spread worldwide and ended up killing over 200,000 people (maybe as many as 500,000). Not 200, not 500, but over 200,000.\nDo you recall the the draconian measures taken by the US government to contain that virus in 2009 and 2010? And do you remember the worldwide hostility toward North Americans for that North American virus? The shunning of all things American, the refusal to allow Americans to stay in hotels or enter restaurants, the locking down of New York, Miami, and LA? The martial law, the quarantines, the months of delayed school and the crushing of the US economy? The inability to fly, travel, or even leave your apartment? My memory must be fading, because I don't remember any of that. I remember encouragement to get flu shots then and warnings about the virus, but not the massive, painful disruption of travel, work, school, and normal life, nor escalation in anti-American sentiment. It's our bombs that stir that up, not our virus management policies.\nChina is responding to the crisis by locking down many cities, stranding over 50 million people, with martial-law measures in many other cities with tough regulations forcing many to be quarantined and hindering travel, work, and normal life. Perhaps too extreme, one can argue. There is also the cessation of much public transportation or blockades on roads in and out of many cities, the shutting down of thousands of tourist attractions, delayed operations for millions of employees, delayed school for millions, and so forth. Such extreme measures to contain this virus, and yet there is still international hysteria and blame. Outside of China, two have died, a few hundred are affected. It may get much worse, but right now, it's noting compared to seasonal bouts of influenza and nothing close to our own H1N1 pandemic that generated hardly any hysteria and resulted in a government response that was not exactly aggressive (I'm not saying it should have been -- I really don't know what should have been done). My point is, do we really need to shun China and be angry at the Chinese people for this one?\nYet the virus has unusually dangerous characteristics and may merit the extreme measures to control it. I'm not sure. But I hope we'll keep this in perspective relative to the thousands of deaths the US experiences every flu season from related though perhaps less severe viruses. And I pray that we'll remember China and recognize the great burdens the Chinese people are bearing, and not add to their burdens unnecessarily. Keep China and the Chinese people in your prayers, and thanks to those who are taking steps to help rather than to blame.\nUpdate, Feb. 5 & 6, 2020: Mortality Rates\nRegarding mortality rates, the official data from China suggests the mortality rate may be around 2%, though an early estimate from a small sample suggested it could be 11%. Hopefully mortality will decline as experience in gained and as treatments begin earlier for those at the most risk. However, current morality rates are based on total death relative to total cases, but many of the total cases are very recent, while the deaths are coming from infections that began perhaps a week or two ago when the number of cases were much lower, so the reported fatalities now during a rapidly escalating pandemic are surely severely underestimated, even if all the numbers being reported are accurate.\nHere is some information on the mortality rate of the Wuhan Coronavirus relative to some other related viral infections, provided by ScienceAlert.com :\nThe 2002/03 SARS outbreak (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) started in Guangdong Province and killed 774 people out of a total 8,096 infected. The 2012 MERS outbreak (Middle East respiratory syndrome) killed 858 people out of the 2,494 infected.\nThe respective mortality rates for SARS and MERS patients was 9.5 and 34.5 percent, far higher that for the new coronavirus, which French health minister Agnes Buzyn put at \"less than five percent\".\nThat rate is likely to decline, experts say, as the ratio of deaths to reported cases continues to widen.\nThe coronavirus \"is less deadly than SARS or MERS, but it is more contagious,\" Buzyn said in a press conference Tuesday.\nThe seasonal flu, by comparison, kills 290,000 to 650,000 people per year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In the United States, the mortality rate among people infected with influenza is about 0.13 percent, the Centers for Disease Control has calculated. ",

ALung has treated numerous COVID-19 patients in the U.S. under existing FDA Emergency Use Provisions, and in the European Union, where the Company is approved having been granted their CE Mark in 2013. The Hemolung\u00ae RAS is currently being used in the FDA approved VENT-AVOID trial for the study of ECCO 2 R in the treatment of Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AE-COPD). In addition, the Hemolung RAS and ECCO 2 R have been studied for the treatment of moderate to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in the just concluded UK REST trial, which enrolled 412 patients.\nA public health emergency related to COVID-19 was declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on February 4, 2020. The FDA has issued an EUA for the Hemolung RAS to treat lung failure caused by COVID-19. As indicated in the FDA's EUA letter to ALung, the Hemolung RAS is not FDA-cleared or approved, and there are no FDA-approved or cleared device treatments for lung failure caused by COVID-19. ALung submitted and the FDA reviewed in vitro and in vivo information in support of ALung's ongoing U.S. VENT-AVOID clinical trial for the Hemolung RAS as well as additional information about clinical use of the Hemolung RAS outside the U.S., and additional biocompatibility, cytotoxicity, and performance testing.\nBased on the information submitted, the FDA stated that it believes the Hemolung RAS has the potential to treat lung failure as an adjunct to noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, to reduce hypercapnia and hypercapnic acidosis due to COVID-19, and/or to maintain normalized levels of partial pressure of carbon dioxide(PCO 2 ) and pH in patients suffering from acute, reversible respiratory failure due to COVID-19 for whom ventilation of CO 2 cannot be adequately, safely, or tolerably achieved and, in turn, may provide clinical benefit, and that there is no adequate, approved and available alternative to the emergency use of the Hemolung RAS to treat lung failure caused by COVID-19.\n\"We are pleased with the FDA's recognition that the Hemolung may be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19 by removal of CO 2 directly from the blood during extracorporeal therapy,\" said Mr. Peter M. DeComo, Chairman and CEO of ALung Technologies.\nMr. DeComo further stated, \"With published mortality rates as high as 90% for patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), we believe that the Hemolung can be a valuable tool for physicians to be used in conjunction with IMV, by reducing or eliminating the potential of further lung damage caused by high ventilator driving pressures, often referred to as Ventilator Induced Lung Injury (VILI). Many of the academic medical centers involved with our clinical trial have already requested the use of the Hemolung RAS for treatment of their COVID-19 patients.\"\nAbout ALung Technologies\nALung Technologies, Inc. is a privately held Pittsburgh-based developer and manufacturer of innovative lung assist devices. Founded in 1997 as a spin-out of the University of Pittsburgh, ALung has developed the Hemolung RAS as a dialysis-like alternative or supplement to mechanical ventilation. ALung is backed by Philips, UPMC Enterprises, Abiomed, The Accelerator Fund, Allos Ventures, Birchmere Ventures, Blue Tree Ventures, Eagle Ventures, Riverfront Ventures, West Capital Advisors, and other individual investors.\nFor more information about ALung and the Hemolung RAS, visit www.alung.com .\n VENT-AVOID trial, and a list of enrolling sites, please visit clinicaltrials.gov .\n use of the Hemolung RAS for COVID-19 patients, please visit https://www.alung.com/covid-19/covid-19-us/\n*The Hemolung RAS has not been FDA cleared or approved.\n*The Hemolung RAS has been authorized for the above emergency use by FDA under an EUA.\n*This device is authorized only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of the Hemolung RAS under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb- 3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements, which, if not based on historical facts, involve current assumptions and forecasts as well as risks and uncertainties.

Monday, January 27, 2020 CORONA VIRUS UPDATE by Bob Walsh There are now 41 known deaths from this virus in China. The Chinese authorities are building two brand new hospitals on an emergency basis to deal with what they believe will be the intake from the disease. It seems to be fairly easy to transmit. In one case in China the entire operating theater staff who were operating on a patient who was not known at the time to have the virus came down with it and they were all (presumably) wearing routine surgical protective clothing during the operation. It is most dangerous to people who already have a crappy immune system. It presents first as a mild cough that turns into pneumonia-like symptoms including serious shortness of breath, which normally leads to contact with the health care system. There are now 15 cities in various forms of travel restriction in China. There are at least two known cases in the U. S., with several dozen more suspected cases. Travelers from China are being screened at U S airports that accept flights from China. The virus is thought to be less virulent than the SARS virus that killed 774 people in Asia 17 years ago. The death rate of the SARS virus was about 1% of those known to be infected. ",

Police officer: inside and travelers in Shanghai wear respirators Anyone who places the face protection of politicians above the interests of the people will go down as a sinner in the eternal history of the party and the people. \u201d Right distributed by China\u2019s Communist Party on its social media channel. This apparently follows the insight that the initial cover-up by the Chinese authorities played an inglorious role in the Sars 2002/03 lung disease crisis: as a result, the number of victims increased and 800 people were killed, and the population\u2019s confidence was lost , Sars had then broken out in the hinterland of Hong Kong in the Guangdong province. Because the authorities initially covered up the problem, autonomous Hong Kong became a hotspot for the dangerous infectious disease. China\u2019s regime is still struggling with the loss of confidence there, as the ongoing protests show. The scandals of contaminated milk powder in 2008 and a rapid train accident in 2011, which were also hushed up, sowed further distrust. In times of social media, this can quickly turn into a political crisis for any regime. China\u2019s powerful head of state and party leader Xi Jinping, under whose rule there was a strong centralization of power, appears to be aware of the political danger and has positioned itself clearly at the beginning of the week with the call for \u201ccomprehensive measures to prevent and control\u201d the virus. He has made combating the corona virus his own affair and linked it to his image at home and abroad. So far, observers have certified that the regime has responded appropriately to the crisis, has included well-respected experts at an early stage and has given information in a fairly open manner. It is of course much too early for a final assessment. But already now the question arises how transparent a regime can be at all, which otherwise knows no transparency for reasons of political power and is much more based on the principles of control, whitewashing as well as command and obedience. A Hong Kong communications scientist has determined that China\u2019s regime continues to act according to its usual mechanisms: the information, the media, and the narrative are controlled, giving the impression that the government is in control of the situation. The fact that the call quoted at the beginning was deleted after only a few hours shows that the regime is still struggling to the right degree and that the transparency demanded by some continues to have narrow limits.\n,",

Chinese authorities have so far confirmed 9,700 cases all over the country and more than 100 in 19 other countries.\nAmid the mounting death toll and sky rocketing infections, Level 1 emergency response has been launched for 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities on the Chinese mainland. National capital Beijing is making special efforts and is reviving 17 year old hospital used to fight SARS.\nChinese health authorities have confirmed the number of coronavirus cases in mainland China had surpassed the tally of people infected by SARS during the 2002-03 epidemic. For now, the mask shortage has become a country-wide problem. China\u2019s ministry of Industrial and Information technology said that due to the national holiday, current mask production is over eight million each day, comparing to 20 million in normal days. China is trying to purchase it from overseas.\nOur reports, Beijing reports that Prevention and control efforts are in full swing and have been intensified, but the epidemic keeps spreading, with a rapid rising trend in some regions. China has seen 171 recoveries till now and is trying to engage the communities more vigorously to put up a united fight against the devil virus.\nAs Wuhan residents are enduring an isolated, frightening time a hotline has been opened in central China\u2019s Hubei Province to help people maintain psychological health amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.\nMedical workers, teachers, students and the general public can call the hotline number 4007027520 to request help for psychological issues related to the epidemic. An official WeChat account has also been set up to provide 24-hour service. China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce has said in a circular that China will release winter and spring vegetable reserves in major northern cities to ease supply shortages.\nFood supply trucks and cargo ships have been given special permission for transportation. Ministry of Civil Affairs said, Social organizations that spread false information or engage in illegal activities during the new coronavirus outbreak will be severely punished.\nChinese experts are hopeful that an inflection point is likely to appear within the next one or two incubation periods which means roughly next 1 month. During the virus infection stage, the human body produces antibodies, which reduces the level and capability of the virus.\nIt also becomes less pathogenic and contagious. If a vaccine can be made quickly and with improved intervention measures, like early detection and quarantine, inflection points would appear even earlier. It is also essential to prevent the virus from mutating. Chances of such mutating are not much, but it may still cause some serious problems.\nMeanwhile, Chinese Foreign Ministry today announced that it will send charter flights to bring home residents of Corona virus-hit Hubei province from abroad in view of practical difficulties they are facing. The move followed Chinese officials\u2019 announcement that about five million people from Hubei province and capital Wuhan, the epicentre of Corona virus, have travelled out of the region before the province was officially closed on 23rd of January.\nEarlier,World Health Organization has declared an international emergency over the deadly virus. It is a rarely used designation that could lead to improved international co-ordination in tackling the disease. WHO Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that their greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems.\nHe declared the disease a Public Health Emergency of international concern. Mr Tedros, who travelled to China this week and met Chinese President Xi Jinping, said all the concerned people must act together now to limit further spread.\nAIR special correspondent reports that even though China and countries worldwide have launched extraordinary measures, the Declaration of an international emergency will undoubtedly sharpen various governments\u2019 focus on protecting citizens.\nThe declaration of a global emergency triggers recommendations to all countries aimed at preventing or reducing the cross-border spread of disease while avoiding unnecessary interference with trade and travel. It covers temporary recommendations for national health authorities worldwide, which include stepping up their monitoring, preparedness and containment measures.\nAlthough the WHO has no legal authority to sanction countries, it could ask governments to provide scientific justification for any travel or trade restrictions that they impose in the event of an international emergency.\nEven though WHO has praised china\u2019s efforts but declaration would definitely have increased the pressure little bit as china is racing against time to contain it.\nFrom regular dissemination of information to carrying out disinfection work, from the high-quality treatment of patients to ensuring essential supplies in Wuhan and a hotline, china has mounted an extraordinary fight against the virus.\nThe US Government has issued fresh advice against travel to China. This is the highest of the four-level warning system. The State Department\u2019s advice was followed after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a global emergency.",

About me Brownout \u2013 666: The real meaning of the swastika Waiting for a Miracle \u2013 Life in the Dead Zone REVIEWS China and the Corona virus Posted on February 7, 2020 by badjohn7 This new virus is taking headlines around the world. It is very difficult to trust the Chinese government these days and they were certainly very slow to take action. Accordingly to an Israeli biological warfare expert, Wu Han, the source of the current epidemic, and Bejing, the source of the 2003 SARS outbreak, are both sites of the Chinese government\u2019s research into biological warfare. It is just possible, that this outbreak was an accidental escape from a government centre and not from a food market. If this is the case, as I suspect it is, the current Corona virus could be an advanced form of warfare against the Chinese people as well as global populations.\nThis virus appears to be easily spread and almost unstoppable. It doesn\u2019t kill everybody but mainly the elderly. We all know that that China and most of the rest of the world\u2019s governments want to get rid of as many of the elderly as possible. I have talked about this in previous posts as well as in my book, \u201cFrom Brexit to Brazil via Hong Kong, China and the USA.\u201d(available on Amazon). Of course there is collateral damage; babies, young children and some adults. It is extremely sad that the Chines doctor who blew the whistle on this new virus outbreak has died. He was not elderly.\nAs the virus continues to spread you had better hope you are not elderly or in bad health. Thank you, Chinese government!\nA scary world leader",

From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages.\nCan pets at home spread the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?\nAt present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus. However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets.\nDo vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?\nNo. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.\nCan regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?\nNo. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold.\nCan gargling mouthwash protect you from infection with the new coronavirus?\nNo. There is no evidence that using mouthwash will protect you from infection with the new coronavirus.Some brands or mouthwash can eliminate certain microbes for a few minutes in the saliva in your mouth. However, this does not mean they protect you from 2019-nCoV infection.\nCan eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?\nGarlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.\nDoes putting on sesame oil block the new coronavirus from entering the body?\nNo. Sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus. There are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the 2019-nCoV on surfaces. These include bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, either solvents, 75% ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform.However, they have little or no impact on the virus if you put them on the skin or under your nose. It can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin.\nDoes the new coronavirus affect older people, or are younger people also susceptible?\nPeople of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.\nAre antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?\nNo, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.However, if you are hospitalised for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.

The virus could lead to \u201cfaults in China,\u201d which could spread to the rest of the world economy, he said before the US Congress.\nThe American central bank is closely following the development.

        "content": "When the United States 2009 H1N1 swine flu emerged, an international emergency, a declared global pandemic, it eventually infected 60 million and initially killed a minimum of 18,449 cases that year. But the final story of the H1N1 global pandemic was far worse than that, with close to 300,000 deaths, according to the final tallies in 2012 reported by the CDC, as you will read below. Which is why I am scratching my head at how bizarrely negative forces are attacking China and Chinese people as it engages a remarkably aggressive front addressing this Corona virus outbreak which started in Wuhan, central China. I am forced to ask and answer a few questions. During 2009 H1N1 outbreak, I don't recall xenophobic anti-America attacks across the globe, do you? In fact, do you recall it took six months for the U.S. to declare a national emergency? Did any government from the onset in April 2009 through the end in April 2010, including the month of June, when H1N1 was declared an international emergency global pandemic, then send out a notice to its citizens that they should leave the United States? Close their borders to American travelers? Nope, not a peep. Like I said, something's not right, folks. I am reading hateful vicious attacks on the Chinese government for their supposed intentional conspiracy to intentionally under report the number of infections, yet that is exactly and always the case with such flu outbreaks no matter what country and the CDC reports illustrate that crystal clear. The U.S. H1N1 swine flu numbers were vastly underestimated and updated three years later, because dear friends, that is the nature of such viral outbreaks which don't care which country they started in. There is never enough man power, there are never enough test kits, there is never enough medicine or medical supplies. China is not trying to hide these hardships, they are well known, they are being reported on the news daily in China. There are always people who die, thousands of them whom we'll never know if they actually died because of a particular virus. Those are the facts, not any problem unique to China's healthcare system or government. Its not a conspiracy, its just tragedy. According to the June 27, 2012 research report followup three years later, it gets much more disturbing when you learn about the CDC's final estimate of the H1N1 virus global death toll. You and I find at this at this article at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy website, the CDC's 18,449 total deaths number was \"...regarded as WELL BELOW THE TRUE TOTAL, mainly because many people who die of flu-related causes are not tested for the disease.\" So during the 2009 outbreak, was anyone accusing the American medical and government authorities of hiding the numbers? Were Americans with hidden cameras strolling into the Mayo Clinic to PROVE how many people were really dying? The absurdity of these vicious attacks are that whether or not a person specifically does have the Corona virus or some other viral bug presenting as pneumonia, the treatment is the same supportive treatment anyway. Something's not right here folks. The world should be applauding China's unprecedented, broad, aggressive response. (WHO officials and many other government and healthcare officials across the globe are.) I am on the ground here in China READ IT HERE watching with my own eyes and it is quite incredible by any measure, not to mention an enormous economic sacrifice. Instead of looking at the will of an entire system of government acting faster than any other government on the planet could, we are one month later, still busy bashing a few local government officials in Wuhan who should have told us a couple weeks sooner. And yes, that is true those local officials screwed up. And by the way, those officials are in deep trouble for it. Just like the recent Puerto Rican politicians who are in trouble when we learned they didn't distribute hurricane emergency supplies that were sent to them to help during last year's terrible hurricane. A disgrace. Individual people screw up all the time and hopefully justice gets served later, but that's not an indictment of an entire country's government. Secondly, on this point, every provincial government has sent out a notice to its government officials pretty much saying that if they are stupid enough to do the same, they will face the wrath of harsh punishment. I don't doubt it for a moment. Lets contrast to what countless western politicians have gotten away with and remain in office to remind all of us that human error, stupidity and greed is not unique to any particular skin color or race or country. \"What about...\" reactions don't help. And here's the mic drop for you: \"The CDC researchers estimate that the H1N1 2009 pandemic virus caused 201,200 respiratory deaths and another 83,300 deaths from cardiovascular disease associated with H1N1 infections.\" Total: 284,000 deaths. Shocking, isn't it? Was there a travel ban for any length of time to and from the United States? Did China, Germany, Japan or any other country close their border to American travelers? Today I noticed in the updates that following the United States Department of State policy suggesting U.S. citizens leave China, the United Kingdom embassy just released the same recommendation to subjects of the kingdom. In 2009, did UK subjects in America get a notice from their kingdom to leave America? No. Did the world suggest we isolate from America? Close the U.S. borders!? No. Did Americans get xenophobically attacked and targeted by anti-American sentiments like the Chinese are experiencing now? Um, no. Fascinating and disturbing to say the least. If you're an expat currently in China, unless you're in Wuhan, fact is that you're most likely safer and more peaceful and more stable by simply staying put than by leaving right now. You couldn't be safer than in this country, where almost everyone is staying home and dutifully isolating themselves with awareness. Not to mention that the Chinese government's decision to safeguard the society, the families, the people, is coming at a devastating economic cost in the hundreds of billions. I have a friend in Mesa, Arizona. He told me earlier that the big popular China City buffet, a huge busy place, has no customers. Does that make any sense at all? Let's test our ability to reason, to be rational: If you were in Miami and you heard that there was a virus outbreak that started in Milan, in central Italy, would you cancel your dinner reservation at the Italian restaurant that night in South Beach? No. Would you buy a pizza next week at Joey's Pizzeria in Delray Beach? If you were in Singapore and you heard there was a virus outbreak in Dallas, Texas in the central United States, would you stop going to your favorite local Texas southern BBQ restaurant with the owner from Houston, in Singapore? Would you avoid olive-skinned dark-haired Italian-looking people on the street in Chicago? Would you avoid big guys wearing cowboy hats, cuz they're obviously from Texas in Singapore cuz there's a virus in Dallas and they might have just gotten off the plane? There's a strange senseless bullying extremism and activism in today's society and you should do your best to avoid it and not be a part of it. It is fomented by a small group of extremist activists while definitely not supported by your average mainstream person who is simply exhausted by their outrage-inducing antics. Finally, here are some straight up, sensible accurate descriptions of this Corona virus which started in Wuhan, China. Its not called the China virus and neither was H1N1 called the America virus. Whether two weeks or two months from now, this flu season type virus will have passed and the joy of Spring will have arrived. Just like every flu season. However, don't misunderstand me. The extra caution and the remarkable response by the Chinese governments and people together to quell the spread of this virus was warranted because, yes it is correct that this corona virus is nastier than the usual annual flu bug, as was H1N1 in 2009. As of now, what we can confidently note the following regarding this Corona virus: This Corona virus is highly contagious, it spreads quite easily. It binds to lung tissue and so in particular, likes to cause pneumonia, that's what infection of lung tissue is. That's more severe than a respiratory infection which is only in your throat or bronchial tubes. The Corona virus currently has a 2% death rate. That's a lot higher, around 20x higher, than a more typical annual flu virus with a death rate of 0.1%. However, a 2% death rate is still much lower by comparison to the SARS virus which had a 9% death rate or the MERS virus with a really nasty 37% death rate. The Corona virus is causing severe symptoms in 10-15% of cases. 80% to 90% of deaths from this virus are happening in elderly patients, mostly with other existing health problems, not younger people. That characteristic by the way, is in contrast to the America 2009 H1N1 swine flu virus which in fact had a higher death rate amongst younger people including children rather than those over 60 years old. China identified and shared the Corona virus genome in record times, in only days and of course, immediately shared it with all international health and disease organizations. Medical researchers are already discovering that certain existing anti-viral medications seem to be effective against this Corona virus. Its impossible not to marvel at China's broad and aggressive domestic response directed by the provincial level governments to restrict movement, restrict transportation, restrict business for a period of time combined with the voluntary dutiful cooperation of its 1.3 billion citizens who are in the majority quietly staying at home these weeks to let the virus pass; this model response is already being hailed by the international community as a remarkable unprecedented response setting a new standard in understanding what is possible for future outbreaks in whatever country they may occur. Is it inconvenient and costly. You bet. Like I said, something's not right with the way humanity is responding to what's happening here. I haven't put my finger on it because well, its certainly complex and the world is upside down in many other ways that I also can't for the life of me understand or explain without ending up writing a very thick book. But I do know this: It needs to stop. This vicious, political, xenophobic racist attacks and smearing of all things China needs to stop. Its really not helping anyone in the political corridors of Washington nor is it doing anything to help the man on the street who is just concerned with taking care of his family. My family is originally from the Basilicata region of Italy, the little hillside Italian towns of Potenza and also, Grottola, which is just outside of Matera. They left their home country and moved to America where I was born, in Yonkers, New York. America became their home and it was my home until I left, too. Now over two decades ago, I left the United States, the country I was born in, the country that has plenty to admire and plenty to improve. But I left and I came to China and now China is my home. If you had asked me thirty years ago if this was my life plan on planet earth, I would have said you were nuts or a really bad fortune teller. But that's how it has turned out. I am truly blessed with my lovely Chinese wife and our family living here in Shenyang in China's northeast. You get my meaning? I am a mature adult like many with the powers of observation. I can easily see that whether we are talking about China or the United States or any other country, their societies and their governments have good points and bad points. The xenophobia needs to stop now. Whether in a couple of weeks or months later, this nasty flu type Corona virus will begin declining and the joy of Spring will arrive. Between now and then if you don't have anything good, anything supportive to say about China or Chinese people, how about you just keep your mouth shut. Mario Cavolo, Shenyang.",

        "content": "Dusseldorf In China, everyday work should start slowly on Monday. But it is already clear within the first few hours of the day: nothing is going normally in the world\u2019s second largest economy.\nNothing is normal for companies in China either. Since Monday, they have officially been able to resume work in most provinces and cities. But the conditions under which everyday work starts again are a major challenge for the economy.\nIt is so great that there is growing fear that the corona virus will not only threaten human lives, but will soon break global supply chains. Added to this is the falling demand from the market, which is particularly important for German companies.\nAnalysts are currently cutting their earnings estimates for almost all listed companies on a weekly basis. As soon as they hit their balance sheet numbers for the first weeks and months of the year, the heads of finance and board of directors are likely to follow the increasingly skeptical analysts, especially the high-export companies with strong China business.\nAt Daimler and Volkswagen, earnings forecasts are already shaky given the high proportion of China. Profit growth of a good ten percent, as analysts expect on average for the 30 DAX companies this year, can no longer be maintained given their 15 percent share of total sales in China.\nMany companies are directly feeling the effects of the corona virus and the tough measures that Chinese local governments have taken to prevent the virus from spreading further. For example, production in China is already starting up again at the German health care company Fresenius. There is no all-clear yet. Because at individual locations, the local authorities have ordered the extension of the New Year holidays until the end of the week.\nIn the meantime, customer demand has been partially met with existing inventory, the company said. However, it is not known how the current quarantine restrictions imposed by the Chinese government will affect future delivery ability.\nThe situation is similar at the Leverkusen-based plastics manufacturer Covestro: the company has already cut its production volume in China. The group operates a large plant in Shanghai with more than 2,000 employees. There, large quantities of the transparent plastic polycarbonate are produced, which are used in China in the automotive and electronics industries as well as in medical technology. Covestro is suffering from lower demand due to the extended mandatory break.\nIn addition, the industrial value chain with suppliers, logistics, packaging and shipping is affected because in many provinces workers and employees cannot start their work as planned or only after a delay due to travel restrictions. Travel and transportation restrictions between individual provinces led to delays in customer deliveries and increased warehousing.\nBosch and Trumpf have started up their plants in China again after the compulsory break, but cannot yet estimate the effects the crisis will have on their businesses.\nThe Peek & Cloppenburg clothing chain, on the other hand, is already anticipating late deliveries in the procurement of goods. \u201cDue to the slower trade routes for raw materials such as fabrics and yarns in the Far East, delays in deliveries from other production countries can also be expected,\u201d says the D\u00fcsseldorfers. Damage can only be estimated after a long time\nCorporations and analysts are currently struggling to estimate how corona virus will ultimately impact businesses. The economic damage from such an unusual crisis can usually only be really assessed after several weeks or months, says Nigel Todd, director of the German branch of the insurer Global FM. \u201cMost companies now fall back on contingency plans and see if they can get components from alternative suppliers.\u201d\nSo does Siemens. CEO Joe Kaeser said last week that the company had put together a purchasing team to ensure that the company got its components and parts on time. At the moment, it was not yet possible to make any statements about the concrete effects of restrictions in production or in the supply chain, it said on Monday.\nThe situation is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the coronavirus crisis initially occurred at a time when China was already at a standstill due to the nationwide New Year celebrations. During the weeklong public holidays, most of the production activities are stopped, factories, authorities and offices are closed. The week after is traditionally quiet.",

        "content": "Businesses and airports are closed. With a population of more than 1.3 billion people, China is slowly being isolated as more and more airlines cancel flights to the country.\n\nThe Chinese government has already spent $173 billion (Sh17.3 trillion) to stabilise the markets. Tourism is gone and the wider impact of the virus has immensely impacted local enterprises and is affecting global supply chains.\nThis tragic event could have been avoided. The city of Wuhan in Huabei province of China is learning the hard way that public health is an expensive affair if not taken seriously.\nChina is not a unique case. The likelihood of such a plague happening in many African cities is high because there are no strong public health institutions to regulate such things as consumption of game meat known as \u201cbush meat.\u201d\nThere are lessons to learn from Wuhan. The first is that we must begin to take public health much more seriously.\nLet us not forget that Ebola, a fatal viral haemorrhagic fever, has evolved from being confined to a few West African countries to a global public health menace due to growing movement of people.\nTo date, there is no known treatment protocol for Ebola. The solution is simply to improve our public health practices and limit eating of uninspected animal meats.\nAs evidenced from Wuhan, the cost of a public health emergency is far greater than any country can handle.\nWe can avoid this if we begin to build better institutions of public health. It must be in our DNA that individual actions have a bearing on our collective will.\nThere are several interventions we ought to be making as a strategy to minimise or limit chances of such a catastrophe. These interventions will require good data for decision-making.\nTherefore, capturing and analysing the same is of critical importance. For example, daily data on patient disease profile must be analysed to reveal emerging patterns. It is the patterns that can reveal disease outbreaks.\nKenya lacks the organisational culture to respond to public health emergencies. More often than not, it is media that has provided early warning on any outbreak, famine or some other catastrophe. Sometimes the reports come in too late when lives have been lost.\nThe responses have always been laughable when emergency teams take long and when they appear they always have wrong solutions.\nAn early warning system should be able to communicate to different government agencies responsible for emergency services. In my view, these agencies should include the military, which has the time to conduct drills and build some organisational culture that can rescue the country from public health emergencies.\nThe increased movement of people in the region makes every country in Africa vulnerable to such diseases as Ebola.\nWASH HANDS\nPerhaps the best preventive mechanism to minimise the risk is making hygiene part of the school curricula at all levels. One proven method of slowing down the spread of coronavirus is to wash hands, something that we should be doing every time we plan to ingest any food.\nThe end game is to inculcate a culture and sometimes conduct simulations of what to do in the event we had such an emergency.\nOther interventions include leadership that can influence the right public behaviour. Without such leadership, planning for the city, collecting solid waste and minding the welfare of the people won\u2019t exist.\nThis is where we are at the moment in Nairobi. It is what the city residents are complaining about. Their fears about disease outbreak are real, considering the perennial water shortage in the city.\nUnfortunately, virtually nothing is being done to solve any of the urban problems in Kenya. Shanties are expanding, congestion is growing and mounds of garbage bile up in many estates. Stagnant water dots every gulley and creates a conducive environment to breed new diseases.\nIt is cheaper now to wade off disease by investing in the necessary infrastructure and building the right organisational culture than waiting to react to an epidemic that we have helped create.\nListen to the growing protests on the deteriorating environmental conditions in poor neighbourhoods.\nWe have many young people without jobs and have paid local taxes but we still lack the leadership to develop the necessary vision that puts the two together to ensure good life for every citizen.

CUPE flight attendants who travel the globe, including through mainland China, are at higher likelihood for exposure.\nMany things are unknown about the new coronavirus, including how the virus is spread. However, CUPE has created a general information page that can be found here . This page will be updated as new information becomes available.\nCUPE is calling on all airlines to consult with CUPE local unions and institute emergency control measures immediately, including providing crew members with the following information: How to identify signs/symptoms of illness (in oneself and others), and How to manage potentially ill persons onboard.\nCUPE is encouraging airlines to adopt the following recommendations: Provide every flight attendant on all flights with a sufficient amount of non-allergenic medical gloves and masks that are determined to be appropriate protection by Health Canada and/or WHO . Provide any volunteer medical personnel assisting with medical situations with an adequate supply of medical gloves and masks that are determined appropriate protection by the World Health Origination. Permit flight attendants working on flights to wear gloves any time during the flight without any threat of discriminatory or disciplinary actions. Develop realistic procedures and/or engineering controls for isolating symptomatic passengers if the incident aircraft is too full to permit isolating an unoccupied radius around the symptomatic individual(s) (consistent with WHO recommendations). Require pre-flight briefings to communicate the use of universal precaution procedures and equipment to prevent exposure on a flight, as well as briefings to review guidance in the event that a passenger exhibits signs or symptoms of infectious disease during a flight. Provide an adequate supply of surgical masks for any passengers who exhibit symptoms on a flight. Provide a leak-resistant airsick bag that is immediately available for each passenger. Ensure all aircraft meet the federal requirements for access to soap and running water. Require airlines to follow CDC -recommended guidelines for cleaning aircraft and any contaminated areas after a flight with a sick traveler who may have a communicable disease, including protection and training for the aircraft cleaners. Take precautions\nCUPE reminds all flight attendants to take every precaution that has been made available to prevent the spread of communicable disease.\nReview universal precautions in your flight attendant manuals. Also, please remember that surgical masks are not designed and do not prevent the inhalation of airborne contaminants or viruses. Surgical masks are designed to prevent the spread of the wearer\u2019s fluids and are best used for passengers who are showing signs of illness.\nCUPE will provide additional updates as more information is available and will continue to press airlines for action as we work to keep flight attendants and the travelling public healthy and safe.",

ADVERTISEMENT\nThe ship is anchored a kilometer (0.6 miles) from the main Sihanoukville port in the Gulf of Thailand and a team of health officials will conduct checks and determine the disembarkation process, Preah Sihanouk province Gov. Kouch Chamrouen told The Associated Press.\nSome 20 passengers have reported stomachaches or fever, Cambodian health officials said. The ship's health staff considered them to be normal illnesses, but the ill passengers were being isolated from others, Health Ministry spokeswoman Or Vandine said.\nA military helicopter is on standby to carry samples from passengers to the Pasteur Institute in Phnom Penh for analysis.\nShe said if tests show any passengers have the disease, they'll be allowed to get treatment in the country.\nKuoch Chamrouen said that once the health officials onboard are done checking the passengers, the Westerdam will be allowed to dock at the main port. About 500 passengers are scheduled to then disembark on Thursday. From the port the passengers will board buses that will transport them to the nearby airport to take a flight to Phnom Penh from where they can proceed to their onward destinations.\nAbout 30 buses were waiting at the port to transport the passengers.\nU.S. Ambassador W. Patrick Murphy said he sent an embassy team to work with the ship's representatives and Cambodian officials to help Americans disembark and transfer to their onward destinations.\n\u201cWe have also coordinated with foreign embassies of other nationalities,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\nThailand refused to allow the Westerdam to dock this week after it had already been turned away by the Philippines, Taiwan, Japan and Guam.\nCambodia agreed Wednesday to allow the ship in.\n\u201cAll approvals have been received and we are extremely grateful to the Cambodian authorities for their support,\u201d cruise operator Holland America Line said on its website. The ship's request to remain in Cambodia was approved through next Monday.\nThe Westerdam began its cruise in Singapore last month and its last stop before it was refused further landings was in Hong Kong, where 50 cases of the viral disease have been confirmed.\nCOVID-19 has sickened tens of thousands of people in China since December, and more than 170 cases have been confirmed on another cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, which made stops in Hong Kong and other ports before arriving in Japan last week.\nWorld Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said earlier he was pleased Cambodia had agreed to accept the Westerdam and described it as an example of the international solidarity advocated by the U.N. health agency.\nCambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen is a strong ally of China and has played down any threat from the new disease in his country. He had declined to ban direct flights to China, a step taken by other governments and airlines. Cambodia has confirmed just one case of the virus, in a Chinese visitor.\nA passenger on the Westerdam expressed relief at the news the ship would be docking in Cambodia.\n",

An Emergency Operation Cell at the Federal health ministry was monitoring the situation round the clock.\nHe said as per standard guidelines and procedure any traveler from China having flu-like symptoms had to be isolated and monitored.\n\"Let me assure the people that the government is closely monitoring the situation and all necessary measures are being taken to screen all travelers from China .\" He said thermos scanners and thermo Guns had been provided to well trained health staff at airports in Karachi , Lahore and Islamabad to screen all passengers. Separately, a special dedicated team was assigned for screening of passengers arriving via flights from China .\nHowever, China has closed its outbound direct flights to Pakistan due to Chinese spring festival.\nAccording to the current schedule , South China Airline flights will resume from January 29 and China Airlines flights will resume from February 3.\nHe said instructions had been given to all major hospitals to make arrangements to receive possible cases and provide them necessary care. \"We have established contact with all provincial chief ministers, provincial health departments and relevant ministries including Interior dealing with immigration, aviation division and National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to ensure there is seamless coordination and that our efforts are synergized, timely and effective.\" Considering that there will be heavy influx of travelers from China after 8th of February 2020 when the celebrations of Chinese New Year conclude, all relevant authorities had been asked to carry out robust surveillance for screening at the points of entry at Islamabad , Lahore , Karachi airports alongside seaports and land crossings, raising public awareness and ensuring hospital preparedness for management of potential cases, Mirza added.\n\"I am personally monitoring the situation and we are meeting every 48 hours with heads of hospitals, health institutions and all relevant departments to review the situation and take necessary measures for optimal level of preparedness and mitigation in the event we have a suspected case. We are establishing a help line to be functional from Wednesday for information on the disease and to respond to queries.\" He said there was absolutely no cause for panic or alarm. People need to take simple precautions for prevention against common flu like covering the nose and mouth while coughing and sneezing, frequent hand washing for 20 seconds with soap, avoiding close contact with sick people, avoid contact with animals, avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, he added.\nHe said those who have or a person near them have traveled to or from China , within the last 14 days and developed suggestive symptoms including unexplained fever, cough or breathing difficulty, should seek medical attention.\nHe said Novel Coronavirus was a new respiratory virus first identified in Wuhan , Hebei Province of China . The facility to confirm the new virus through a laboratory test was only available in a few countries of the world .\nHowever, the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad is fully equipped to isolate corona viruses closely related to the Novel Coronavirus and thus the virus can be confirmed by excluding other types of Coronaviruses. \"We are in touch with Chinese authorities and kits to test for Novel Coronavirus will be received in a few days.\" He said Novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) with animal origin identified as the cause of this outbreak had to date caused at least 2000 cases and 56 deaths in China .\nOther countries including Thailand , Japan , South Korea , Taiwan and United States , France and Australia have also reported few confirmed cases with travel history to China .\nHe said there was no vaccination or specific antiviral treatment for this respiratory illness. Currently, there was no recommendation for restricting international travel or trade.",

        "content": "Just yesterday we predicted that it is only a matter of time before we get a headline like \" stocks surge on optimism China epidemic is contained\" You know it's coming: \u2014 zerohedge (@zerohedge) January 21, 2020\nAnd sure enough, less than 24 hours later, in an attempt to explain the return of overnight market euphoria Reuters writes that \"world stock markets looked to be getting back to full strength on Wednesday, as updates from China about the spread of a new flu-like coronavirus raised hopes the outbreak would be contained \" and Bloomberg doubled-down that \"U.S. equity-index futures gained on Wednesday as China took steps to contain the spread of a deadly virus\", which is ironic since just moments ago China's CCTV reported that there are now 473 confirmed Coronavirus cases in China , with many cases now observed internationally, and most recently, a Coronavirus case were confirmed in Hong Kong as the epidemic spreads. And yet, after dropping by 9 points yesterday, S&P futures have more than made up those losses and are up 14 points as of Wednesday morning.\nChina\u2019s National Health Commission said on Wednesday there were 440 cases of the new virus, with nine deaths so far, and added that measures are now in place to minimize public gatherings in the most-affected regions. How one can prevent people from gathering in China, the world's most congested nation, remains unclear. Meanwhile, the outbreak has spread from its origin in Wuhan, China, to the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. The World Health Organization meets later on Wednesday to consider whether the outbreak is an international emergency.\nIn other words, despite what a handful of algos would like to telegraph, the Coronavirus is anything but contained , with the outbreak reviving memories of the SARS epidemic in 2002-03, a coronavirus outbreak that killed nearly 800 people. And the punchline: according to Reuters, \"this time China\u2019s response and candour \u2014 in contrast to the SARS epidemic \u2014 have helped reassure investors concerned about the possible global fallout.\" Actually, the \"response and candour\" confirm, if anything, that China is panicking, but as usual the market is never wrong, until it is.\n\u201cThe call here is not that the virus is done or nipped in the bud by any means,\u201d said Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist at Saxo Capital Markets. \u201cBut there have been no big further reported outbreaks, and the response from the Chinese authorities has been very, very positive\u201d.\n\"I would expect a lot of people - candidly, like we are - that are looking for opportunities to buy rather than sell\u201d amid the dip in stocks caused by virus-contagion worries, Lamar Ville re, partner and portfolio manager at Villere & Co., said on Bloomberg TV. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to be the beginning of the end.\u201d\nBecause one obviously \"buys rather then sells\" when stocks are trading at never before seen highs.\nIn any case, optimism that \"Corona is Contained\" helped European stocks in London, Frankfurt and Paris score early gains of 0.1% to 0.2%. European equities first erased initial gains to mirror whiplash price action for stocks in Asia, where early losses reversed after Beijing outlined measures to contain the outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus, however it has since rebounded again.\nEarlier in the session, Asian stocks resumed their climb, rebounding from the last session led by consumer-staples and technology companies. The benchmark stock gauge recovered about half of Tuesday\u2019s losses, with most markets in the region gaining. Shares in Hong Kong also rebounded, with technology stocks and insurers boosting the Hang Seng Index. Chinese shares erased losses after Beijing said it will start a nationwide screening effort to tackle the outbreak.\nMSCI\u2019s airline industry index .posted its biggest daily drop in more than three months on Tuesday. Airline shares were still falling on Wednesday.\n\u201cWhile details on the coronavirus are scant, we reckon that the SARS period could offer some clues as to how markets could pan out,\u201d analysts at Singapore\u2019s DBS Bank said. \u201cThe trends are clear: Yields and stock prices fell in the first few months of the SARS outbreak and rebounded thereafter.\u201d\nAnd yes, the return of Fed-backstopped euphoria means a new record high in the US too where S&P 500 futures just hit a new all time high, reaching Michael Hartnett's target of 3,333 more than one month ahead of schedule (March 3).\nIn rates, US 10Y Treasurys were unchanged with the yield on U.S. 10-year government bonds stabilizing after Tuesday\u2019s drop, sitting at 1.78% US10YT=RR in European trading. Core European and U.K. bond yields are also little changed across most of the curves. Italian government bond yields rose as much as 8 basis points on reports the leader of the country\u2019s 5-Star party and foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, will step down, however they recovered all losses after it was confirmed that he is indeed stepping down. It was the biggest, if brief, sell-off in a month and raised the risk of another snap election in Europe\u2019s fourth-largest economy, since 5-Star is part of Italy\u2019s coalition government.\n\u201cThe initial reaction was to sell because of the heightened political uncertainty,\u201d said Luca Cazzulani, a strategist at UniCredit in Milan. \u201cBut there is no outright link between de Maio\u2019s resignation and a collapse of the government.\u201d\nIn FX, with markets generally rising, safe plays such as gold and the Japanese yen were weaker. The dollar was rising toward the highs it reached in December against the other top world currencies.

Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) managed to rebound from opening weakness as outperformance in Consumer Staples, Tech and Healthcare underpinned the Australian benchmark to a fresh all-time high, while Tokyo sentiment was mainly driven by currency moves but with weakness seen in some automakers including Mitsubishi Motors after several of its locations were raided in Germany on suspicion of using emission cheating devices.

Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB (-0.6%) lags its peers with the Italian Banking Index hitting 6-week lows \u2013 on the back of Di Maio\u2019s resignation as the Italian 5SM leader.

Elsewhere, Daimler (-1.7%) reversed opening gains on the back of another profit warning in which it expects FY19 results to be below forecasts, with the return on sales of Mercedes-Benz vans also forecast below prior guidance. Meanwhile, ASML (-1.2%) shrugged off a mostly in-line earnings report and a EUR 6bln share buy-back programme, potentially on concerns that the Co. may not completed this programme given that the FY19 share buy-back was incomplete.\nTop European News Rolet to Step Down as CEO of Billionaire Hintze\u2019s Hedge Fund CQS U.K. Government Spending Soars as Austerity Continues to Thaw ECB Hits Fifth Anniversary of QE Still Puzzled by Inflation Gap Greece\u2019s Lawmakers Elect Country\u2019s First Woman Head of State\nIn FX, although safe-haven flows are unwinding amidst less acute concern about China\u2019s coronavirus and knock-on effects, partly due to Chinese efforts to contain the spread and extent of contamination, the scale of Swiss Franc declines suggest that something else is afoot. Indeed, Usd/Chf has rebounded firmly above 0.9700 to around 0.9730 and Eur/Chf is hovering nearer a circa 1.0790 peak vs 1.0735 trough even though the single currency has retreated further from 1.1100+ highs vs the Dollar towards key technical support (100 DMA at 1.1070) and recent lows (1.1066 from December 20). Eur/Usd has been undermined to a degree by renewed Italian political instability awaiting an official 5-Star Movement announcement that is expected to confirm the resignation of leader Di Maio and leave one of the coalition Government parties without a head. No evidence to support the theory until next Monday\u2019s weekly Swiss sight deposit statement, but perhaps the Franc has been sold in advance of anticipated FTQ positioning? JPY/NZD/AUD/GBP/CAD - The Yen has also conceded some ground on renewed risk appetite premises, but holding close to 110.00 against the Greenback, while the Aussie and Kiwi remain depressed below 0.6600 and 0.6850 respectively as the clock ticks down to Thursday\u2019s major Antipodean data points in the form of CPI and jobs.

WTI meanders around USD 58/bbl ahead of its 200 DMA at 57.57/bbl and the 100 DMA at 57.29, whilst the Brent contract fell below its 100 DMA (62.79/bbl) with eyes on its 200 DMA at 63.97/bbl as Mar\u201920 futures test yesterday\u2019s low just above 64/bbl.

I think 3 miles of that was taking a forced detour as Mr Trump\u2019s motorcade came through town. We hosted a fascinating panel on sustainability pitting NYT best selling author Andrew McAfee who\u2019s written an optimistic tome (More From Less) against Tim Jackson - an ecological economist - who has written a more pessimistic book (Prosperity Without Growth). It made for a lively debate and in all my interactions its clear that the number of these conversations are rising exponentially. In talking about our Davos piece on this topic (link here) at a separate meeting, one client explained one of the dilemmas they face. They invest in African development and mentioned that surely everyone would want health improvements in the continent - especially the poorer parts. However his assertion was that the only way that can happen in the immediate future is if their energy consumption increases which in turn potentially damages the planet. Raising the awareness of such trade-offs is one of the main themes of our report and this is where more and more attention needs to be focused.\nIt\u2019s fair to say that the two headline grabbers of Davos yesterday have different views on the issue. President Trump said that \u201cwe must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse\u201d. It\u2019s fair to say Greta Thunberg took the polar opposite view. Elsewhere in Mr Trump\u2019s speech, he trumpeted the achievements of his administration, criticised the Federal Reserve once again for not cutting rates fast enough, and also said that talks with China on phase two would start \u201cvery shortly\u201d. Later on, ahead of a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump said that \u201cwe\u2019re going to talk about a big trade deal\u201d and that it was \u201csomething that we all want to be able to make.\u201d However, Trump also said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that he was \u201cabsolutely serious\u201d when it comes to putting tariffs on European cars if a trade deal couldn\u2019t be reached.\nIn terms of today at Davos, Von der Leyen will actually be one of the main speakers, with an address at 11:30 CET, while there\u2019s a potentially interesting panel on the future of financial markets a bit earlier at 10:30 CET, which includes IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, along with the US and UK finance ministers, Steven Mnuchin and Sajid Javid.\nBack to markets, and equities sold off yesterday as the US returned from a holiday, with investors becoming a bit more cautious around the world amidst the continued spread of a new coronavirus in China. Reports that a case had been discovered in the US helped reverse a gradual rally back in markets prior to the last couple of hours of US trading. More on the US session below but the latest on the virus is that with the death toll increasing to 9 from 6, China is likely to start nationwide screening as officials are stepping up the monitoring of transportation links in the country. The confirmed cases of the infection have reached 440 as of January 21 (from 218 on January 20) and 1,394 patients are under medical observation. Including the detection in the US, the virus has now stretched to 5 additional countries with Macau reporting its first case overnight. Elsewhere, the WHO is going to decide today as to whether to declare the virus an international public health emergency. China has said that as of now it has seen no evidence of \u201csuper spreaders\u201d - infected people who pass on the disease rapidly to many other people - but could not rule out that some would emerge. Super spreaders played a key role in the SARS pandemic 17 years ago, which killed almost 800 people and hurt economies across the region.\nAssessing the economic impact of the coronavirus, our Asian economists draw conclusions from the past outbreaks of SARS and MERS (link here) and conclude that the impact from any spread of the disease would be felt most in the form of a sharp decline in retail sales, tourism, hotel & catering and travel activities as people try to avoid infection by restricting travel and people to people contact. Also, if necessary, public health measures might get introduced to reduce infections by imposing quarantines and closing schools which could result in a higher impact. But most other services and trade and manufacturing activities are unlikely to be affected much, in their view; and consumption and travel can be expected to recover quickly, even before the authorities give the all clear as observed during the SARS and MERS outbreak. The big problem is that as the Lunar New Year holidays approach it might prove hard for China to contain. Some good news is that China have been forthcoming and transparent about the spread of this coronavirus as they involved the WHO very early on and have also shared the genetic sequencing of the virus to allow early detection of cases in other countries. This is unlike what happened with SARS which first came to light in China in November 2002 but only got widespread attention after the first cases were detected in Hong Kong in February 2003.\nOvernight in Asia, markets are making advances as investors are moderating their concerns over the virus. The Nikkei (+0.59%), Hang Seng (+1.25%) and Kospi (+1.00%) are all up. Meanwhile, the CSI (+0.08%) and Shanghai Comp (-0.02%) are trading flattish. As for Fx, the Japanese yen is down -0.15% while most Asian currencies are making modest advances. Elsewhere, futures on the S&P 500 are up +0.47% and yields on 10y USTs are up +1.2bps while, gold is trading down -0.33% and oil prices are down -0.40%. As for overnight data releases, South Korea\u2019s preliminary 4Q GDP printed at +2.2% yoy (vs. +1.9% yoy expected).\nBefore this the S&P 500 fell back from its record high from Friday, ending the session down -0.26%. It was a similar story elsewhere, with the NASDAQ (-0.19%) and the Dow Jones (-0.52%) also seeing declines. Boeing (-3.33%) saw another tough session. Before this in Europe, the STOXX 600 pulled back from its intraday low of -0.99% to close just -0.14% lower. Nevertheless the risk-off sentiment supported sovereign debt, with 10yr Treasuries down -5.7bps to 1.766%, while the 2s10s curve flattened by -2.5bps. Gilt yields fell -1.9bps to their lowest level since October, while bunds (-3.1bps) and OATs (-3.0bps) also saw yields move lower. Italy was the exception, where the spread of BTPs over bunds widened by +4.9bps ahead of lots of political news flow of late and a regional election on Sunday. That said, they\u2019re still holding the 150-170bps range seen since mid-November so it\u2019ll be interesting to see if political risk leads to a break out.\nLooking at yesterday\u2019s earnings, UBS shares fell -4.53% after the company reported that last year\u2019s net profit attributable to shareholders was down -5% year-on-year, with the bank also lowering their targets moving forward. Bank stocks were subdued generally yesterday, with the STOXX Banks index closing down -0.47% at a one-month low, though UBS isn\u2019t a member of that particular index.\nStaying with earnings, Netflix reported overnight and said that it added 8.76mn subscribers in 4Q (+20% yoy). However, it forecasted slower subscriber growth in the current quarter at 7mn (vs. 7.82mn) expected. The stock was up +2.38% in afterhours trading. IBM also reported with a slight beat. The stock was up +3.83% after hours.\nOver in FX, sterling was the strongest-performing G10 currency yesterday, as the UK employment numbers ended a run of pretty weak data from the country. The 3m/3m employment change rose to +208k (vs. +110k expected) in November, its highest rate since January, while the unemployment rate remained at 3.8%, in line with expectations. In response, investors lowered the odds of a rate cut from the BoE at next week\u2019s meeting after the data release, with the chances falling to around 60%, having been at 70.5% at the close on Friday. Our economists point out (link here) though that most of yesterday\u2019s announced employment gains have been government led so it shouldn\u2019t change the view on a necessary rate cut too much. The last big data release before the BoE meeting will be the preliminary January PMIs on Friday, so the market will be paying close attention.\nMeanwhile in Germany, the ZEW Survey beat expectations, with the current situation reading rising to -9.5 (vs. -13.5 expected), while the expectations reading rose to 26.7 (vs. 15.0 expected), the strongest reading for the expectations indicator since July 2015. So a note of optimism ahead of tomorrow\u2019s ECB meeting.\nIn terms of the day ahead there are a number of key highlights. From central banks, the Bank of Canada will be deciding on rates, while Bank of England Governor Carney will be speaking at the Bloomberg Climate Forum in Davos. Earnings releases out today include Johnson & Johnson, Abbott Laboratories, ASML and Texas Instruments. Finally on the data, we\u2019ll get French business confidence in January, Italian industrial sales and industrial orders from November, UK public sector net borrowing for December, Canada\u2019s December CPI reading, and finally US existing home sales for December and the FHFA house price index for November.",

        "content": "MG Hector Sales Could Be Impacted By CORONA Virus In Feb, Speculates Company By - MG Hector\u2019s sales numbers could be significantly impacted next month due to the disruption in supply chain from Europe and China caused by Corona virus\nMG Motor India Limited has released a press statement revealing the sales data for its Hector in the first month of the new year. The British manufacturer has sold 3,130 units of the mid-size SUV in January 2020 and the brand is fully committed to the BSVI transition. The company expects significant disruption in supply chain from European and Chinese/Asian suppliers due to the outbreak of Corona virus.\nThus, its sales tally in the month of February could be affected largely as the inventory is minimum courtesy of the booking backlog the brand is dealing with. Gaurav Gupta, Chief Commercial Officer, MG Motor India has said that MG is working on minimising the impact on its operations and end customers and the BSVI transition will continue to happen over the next two month period.\nSince its market debut in the middle of last year, the Hector\u2019s domestic tally stands at nearly 19,000 and between October and January period, the SUV has been consistently averaging more than 3,000 units. In late 2019, MG ramped up its production to meet the demands of the customers by recruiting new personnel and adding shifts to reduce the waiting period. At the 2020 Auto Expo, MG will be unveiling the brand new Gloster full-size SUV based on the Maxus D90 and it will compete against Toyota Fortuner, Ford Endeavour, Mahindra Alturas G4 and Isuzu MU-X. MG says it will set the \u201cbenchmark among luxury SUVs\u201d with class-leading features.\nThe SAIC-owned brand will be showcasing as many as 14 vehicles at the biennial motoring show. Chief among which the three-row Hector and a premium sedan based on Baojun RC-6 are also expected to be present along with an MPV concept. MG recently launched its second vehicle for India as the ZS EV romped onto the scenes with a highly encouraging level of initial bookings. MG is aiming to expand its domestic sales network to 250 dealerships from nearly 200 centres by the end of next month. ",

        "content": "Residents present their IDs at a checkpoint in Metro Manila during the extended community quarantine. Scientific data showed that the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) and increase in health system capacity helped prevent the spread of Covid-19.\n\u201cIf there is no ECQ, Covid-19 cases will spread fast and it will have a high peak,\u201d said Dr. Ma. Regina Justina E. Estuar, project leader of Fassster, or the Feasibility Analysis of Syndromic Surveillance using Spatio-Temporal Epidemiological Modeler for Early Detection of Diseases, at a recent virtual news conference.\nData from Fassster were the bases of the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) in recommending to Malaca\u00f1ang the possible actions to control the coronavirus pandemic in the country.\nPresident Duterte placed Luzon under ECQ until April 30, from the original April 14, owing to the increasing incidence of Covid-19 infections.\nOn Friday Malaca\u00f1ang ordered the extension of ECQ in selected areas, including Metro Manila, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, and other high-risk provinces in Luzon until May 15.\nA general community quarantine (GCQ) will be enforced in low-risk and moderate-risk areas for the same period.\nAs of Friday, the country has a total of recorded 6,981 cases of Covid-19, with 722 recoveries and 462 fatalities.\nHowever, besides ECQ, Estuar also emphasized the importance of the country\u2019s health system capacity in controlling the increase in the number of Covid-19 cases.\nShe showed a Fassster dashboard that indicated that \u201cif ECQ was not declared, the number of confirmed cases would reach up to 2 million on June 21\u201d in the National Capital Region alone.\n\u201cBecause of ECQ, with the limited movement of people, and the increase in health system capacity, the projection of confirmed Covid-19 cases slowed down to half a million,\u201d Estuar said in Filipino.\nShowing another dashboard, Estuar said if ECQ will be lifted on April 30\u2014and if the health system capacity is raised to 40 percent\u2014the confirmed cases will be 12,000 only.\n\u201cIt will show a relatively flat curve,\u201d she explained.\n\u201cThe base graph will have a lower number of confirmed cases if the health system capacity is at 40 percent or more,\u201d Estuar, an Ateneo de Manila University professor, said.\nBeing a tool in decision-making, Estuar explained that the basis of Fassster analysis are data gathered from ECQ and the country\u2019s health system capacity, including testing.\nData on ECQ include measures on the limited movement of people, social distancing and people\u2019s observance of proper hygiene.\nThe health systems and testing capacity data involve the number of available testing kits, testing centers, trained personnel in handling testing, the number of polymerase chain reaction machines, laboratories, hospital beds and personal protective equipment for frontliners, among others.\nWith these sources of data, Estuar noted that there are many scenarios included in Fassster computation.\n\u201cThat is the important contribution of Fassster. We don\u2019t just say \u2018We should lift ECQ, and here is the data.\u2019 We say, \u2018We lift the ECQ and we have a health capacity of 10 percent, 20 percent or 30 percent.\u2019 These are the big concerns in the increase or lowering of projection. We consider various scenarios and cases,\u201d she emphasized.\nThe data are gathered daily from the Department of Health Epidemiology Bureau and undergo data cleaning, where they are verified and validated, said Dr. Raymond Sarmiento of Fassster said in another virtual news conference.\nScience Undersecretary Rowena Cristina Guevara agreed that based on Fassster model, the peak of possible Covid-19 cases is decreasing.\n\u201cBefore, our testing capacity is low, so the peak is high,\u201d she said.\nGuevara noted that since Fassster started working on Covid-19 early this year, it has \u201cregistered 96 percent to 98 percent accuracy.\u201d\n\u201cSo one could trust its data,\u201d Guevara told the BusinessMirror in a phone interview in mixed Filipino.\nScience Secretary Fortunato de la Pe\u00f1a said Health Secretary Francisco Duque were \u201cimpressed\u201d with the performance of the Fassster model and \u201cpraised\u201d it.\nThe trend points to the lowering of the number of deaths and the increasing number of recovering patients, de la Pe\u00f1a told the BusinessMirror in a phone interview.\nDe la Pe\u00f1a agreed that \u201cthe testing capacity\u2014including the ability to have those [Covid-19] infected tested and the ability of the health-care system, the facilities, [the number and capacity of] health-care workers\u2014have big a factor\u201d in the lowering number of infected cases.\nFassster was established in 2016 as an instrument in recording, monitor and assess the cases of illnesses that could become an epidemic or pandemic. Its original targeted diseases are dengue, typhoid fever and measles.\nThe 30-man team is funded by Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development with P19 million for five years.\nEstuar said she feels Fassster \u201cis here to stay,\u201d especially now that the local government units and other stakeholders have realized the importance of developing \u201cgood science\u201d in disease projection.",

The WHO further says, latest information shows the corona virus can be shared between human beings, and the public in PNG must observe and practice proper hygiene, respiratory hygiene and food safety. Health Minister Jelta Wong confirmed, with NBC News yesterday, that there is no system set up yet in the points of entry, but they will do that soon. CNN reports, the corona virus is a cousin of the SARS virus, and is common among animals, but can be transmitted to humans.

In total, 7,134 people tested have been tested, 232 in the last 24 hours.\n\"The dedication you have shown to this is incredible,\" said Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, the province's chief medical officer of health, at Friday's daily coronavirus update. \"As the weekend approaches please continue to follow the public health measures in place.\"\nWatch the full April 24 update:\nAs the province marked seven full days without locating new cases of the highly infectious disease, Fitzgerald issued another health order. Effective Monday at noon, employers who bring in workers from out of the country will be required to provide a 14-day isolation plan for those workers upon entering the province.\n\"This will help us to detect, trace and prevent the spread of imported cases of COVID-19 efficiently and effectively,\" Fitzgerald said.\nFitzgerald reminded anyone wondering if it's safe to visit friends that while there has been a week of no new reported cases, COVID-19 has a 14-day incubation period and can still be spread by people who are presymptomatic or who may have very mild symptoms.\nThe safest bet, she said, is to remain in your bubble, and if that's not possible then to wear a non-medical mask.\nPremier Dwight Ball said the province's new COVID-19 projection models will be released Monday. The government panel will once again be joined by Dr. Proton Rahman, lead of the province's analytics team and a professor of medicine and a clinical researcher at Memorial University's medical school.\nAs a few other provinces begin to roll out plans to relax some of their health restrictions, Ball said each province is at a different stage of readiness, and Newfoundland and Labrador will discuss its plan only after reviewing Rahman's models on Monday and after a scheduled meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday night.\nBall said his priorities for Friday's meeting are tight border control, COVID-19 testing capacity and protective equipment for front-line health staff when hospitals reopen to elective procedures.\n\"Just by the very nature of this COVID environment we'll have a greater demand on protective equipment,\" he said. \"Some of the private sector will have to reach into the pool of protective equipment, too, for them to safely conduct their businesses.\"\nHealth Minister John Haggie said it's crucial that any plan to begin lifting restrictions is done in phases, to allow the government time to assess any effects of relaxing restrictions.\n\"There's no playbook for this, so we have to look at our own context and our own way of life,\" Haggie said.\nHaggie said it will be a balancing act between how many hospital beds are needed to be kept free in case of a recurrence of the virus, and how many will be needed for planned procedures.\n\"There will be a step, then we'll stop and analyze, and then we'll see what happens to the cases. If we're good we'll go to the next step,\" he said.\n\"If at some point we find ourselves in a situation where numbers start to creep up we will have to go backwards. And that is not a failure.\"\nMisinformation Haggie issued a warning about misinformation circulating online about potential cures for COVID-19.\n\"When you hear about people suggesting drinking bleach to deal with COVID-19, there's absolutely no justification for this at all,\" he said.\n\"It is reprehensible. It beggars belief that anyone would do that.\"\nOn Thursday President Donald Trump suggested that scientists should investigate whether putting light or disinfectant into the bodies of infected patients would help combat COVID-19. That resulted in doctors and health experts from around the world urging people not to inject disinfectant into their bodies.\nOn Friday evening Newfoundland and Labrador's health department issued its own news statement telling the public not to consume or inject cleaning products for purposes of treating COVID-19.\n\"There has been recent speculation and social media activity about whether certain cleaning products may be used as an appropriate treatment for COVID-19. This claim is false and poses a serious and dangerous risk to people,\" the release from the department said.\n\"If consumed or injected into the human body, there is a risk of poisoning and in some cases, death.\"\nEaster window Potential spread of the virus during Easter weekend, two weeks ago, was a concern for public health officials, but on Friday Haggie said he was happy to announce that the provincial government's warnings against mass gatherings appeared to have worked.\n\"We are now 14 days out from Good Friday, and about 11 days out from Easter Sunday,\" he said. \"It has obviously paid dividends, and the distancing has been key.\"\nDaily briefings will be suspended over the weekend with new coronavirus numbers being released through government news releases on Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m. Ball said government officials will be made available if there is an unprecedented development over the weekend.\nThe government of Newfoundland and Labrador requires all travellers to fill out a mandatory declaration form upon arriving in the province:",

Corona is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern as person-to-person transmission in UK, USA, Germany, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam (mandatory to report to WHO human and animal cases) has been confirmed. A death in the Philippines on February 2 marks the first death occurring outside of China. The virus behaves like SARS with 2% case fatality (15% of admitted cases), time to death 14 days, 3-4 reproductive number R0, has its origin from bats, spreads through large droplets and predominately from people having lower respiratory infections and hence, universal droplet precautions are the answer.\nStatus\nThe Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating from Wuhan, China, has now spread to 27 countries and territories worldwide, with 17387 confirmed cases and 362 deaths (median age 45, range 2-74, predominately males (71%), deaths more in comorbid cases, just like SARS, mostly does not affect children 15 years of age or less). Countries and territories that have confirmed cases include Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia, Macau, Russia, France, the United States, South Korea, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, Britain, Vietnam, Italy, India, the Philippines, Nepal, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Finland, Sweden and Spain. Cases recorded in Thailand, Taiwan, Germany, Vietnam, Japan, France and the United States involved patients who had not been to China.\nIt\u2019s not new\nEvery decade a zoonotic coronavirus seems to cross species and infect human populations. This decade has seen a virus, the 2019-nCoV, first identified in Wuhan, China, in persons exposed to a seafood or wet market in mid-December 2019.\nCORONA: Crown or Coronary artery\nThe virus belongs to the corona virus family and has an RNA core. The term \u2018corona\u2019 stands for crown or the halo around the sun. The arteries that supply oxygen to the heart are also called coronary arteries, as the heart is considered the crown. When seen under an electron microscope, the virus appears round in shape with spikes poking out from its periphery.\nThe three deadly human respiratory coronaviruses so far Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV]) 2019-nCoV: The virus is 75-80% identical to the SARS-CoV\nThe case fatality is lower than SARS, MERS and EBOLA\n2019-nCoV mortality rate is 2% (earlier thought to be 3%) compared to 34% for MERS, 10% for SARS (out of 5327 cases), 50% for Ebola, 30-40% for small pox, 10-15% for measles (developing countries), 2-5% in children and 15-30% in adults for polio, 5-10% for diphtheria, 4% in infants < 1yr, 1% in children < 4 years for whooping cough AND < 0.1-4 % for swine flu.\nIf Hubei province, where the epicenter of 2019-nCoV, Wuhan, is situated, is removed from the calculation, the national (China) mortality rate comes down to 0.3%. Within the Hubei province, the mortality rate is about 1% if the city of Wuhan is excluded (where it is 5.5%).\nThe case fatality rate with seasonal flu is <0.01% (1 death per 10,000 cases).\nRole of CMAAO and other Medical Associations\nIt is mandatory for all countries to be prepared for containment measures. This includes active surveillance measures, early detection, isolation and case management, tracking contacts and preventing the spread of the virus. It is important to share full data with WHO. It is a legal requirement that all countries share information with WHO under the IHR.\nIf 2019-nCoV is detected in an animal (information about the species, tests, and epidemiological data), it must be reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as an emerging disease.\nAll countries should emphasize on reducing human infection, and preventing secondary transmission and international spread.\nThree is no travel or trade restriction based on the current information available. All countries are required to inform WHO about any travel measures taken. Countries are cautioned against actions promoting stigma or discrimination, in line with the principles of Article 3 of the IHR.\nIt\u2019s Zoonotic but unlikely to spread through seafood in India\nThis new coronavirus is closely related to several bat coronaviruses. Bats seem to be the likely primary reservoir for the virus. While SARS-CoV was transmitted to humans from exotic animals in wet markets, MERS-CoV transmitted from camels. The ancestral hosts were probably bats; however.\nThe virus has been traced to snakes in China, so, it is unlikely to spread in India through sea food. Snakes often hunt for bats. According to reports, snakes were sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan, thus raising the likelihood that the 2019-nCoV might have moved from the host species, i.e., bats, to snakes and then to humans. It is still not understood as to how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts.\nIt is more infectious to humans\nThis new virus seems to grow better in primary human airway epithelial cells as compared to standard tissue-culture cells, unlike SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. The 2019-nCoV will likely behave more like the SARS-CoV.\nHuman to Human infection\nSARS-CoV and MERS-CoV affect the intrapulmonary epithelial cells more than the upper airway cells. Transmission thus occurs primarily from patients with recognized illness and not from patients with mild, nonspecific signs. However NEJM has reported a case of 2019-nCoV infection acquired outside of Asia wherein transmission seems to have taken place during the incubation period in the index patient.\n2019-nCoV seems to employ the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV (human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]). T ransmission is expected to occur only after signs of lower respiratory tract disease develop.\nThe principal cause for breathlessness is the fact that this virus does not attack the throat alone. It attacks the lungs as well. Patients so far have not presented with a sore throat, because the 2019-nCoV attacks the intraepithelial cells of lung tissue.\nIt\u2019s predominantly a large droplet infection: Transmission of 2019-nCoV probably occurs through large droplets and contact and less frequently by aerosols and fomites. In lab, we need minimum BSL-3 (or BSL-4) facilities to prevent transmission.\nThe incubation period: Up to 2 weeks, according to WHO, with mean being 5.5 days\nSymptoms: According to a report published in the Lancet , one-third of the patients landed up in the intensive care unit; and around 15% of these succumbed to the infection. Almost all presented with fever, more than two-thirds had cough and nearly 50% had weakness or muscle ache. More than 50% had shortness of breath.\n2019-nCoV presents with low white cell count and reduction in lymphocyte count, and raised liver transaminase levels.\nMost infected patients experience milder symptoms, but about 1 in 5 people have severe illness, including pneumonia and respiratory failure.\nDrugs\nNo proven antiviral treatment exists yet for the coronavirus. A combination of lopinavir and ritonavir exhibited some promise in patients with SARS, but this was only in the lab and not in humans. A randomized study is underway in Saudi Arabia in patients with MERS; a combination of lopinavir, ritonavir and recombinant interferon beta-1b versus placebo; the results are still awaited.\nScientists in Australia have reportedly developed a lab-grown version of coronavirus. The breakthrough would help researchers globally in their efforts to develop a vaccine and detection tests.\nChloroquine , which has potent antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV, has been shown to have similar activity against HCoV-229E in cultured cells and against HCoV-OC43 both in cultured cells and in a mouse model. However, studies of efficacy in humans are lacking.\nPVP-I mouthwashes and gargles are known to reduce viral load in the oral cavity and the oropharynx. The World Health Organization has included PVP-I in the list of essential medicines. It exhibits a high potency for virucidal activity against viruses of significant global concern, including hepatitis A and influenza, as well as the MERS and SARS coronaviruses.\nUniversal droplets precautions the answer Quarantining for two weeks Timely diagnosis Strict adherence to universal precautions Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.\nThese are everyday habits that can help prevent the spread of several viruses!\nTravel Requires contact of ten minutes within a distance of six feet The virus can remain alive on any surface for 3-12 hours3. Choose a window seat and remain there to lower your chances of encountering an infectious disease.\nContagiousness\nThe reproduction number, referred to as R0 or \u201cr naught\u201d is the number of additional people that an infected person can infect.\nA recent study has shown Ro as high as 4.08. This exceeds WHOs estimate of 1.4-2.5 made on January 23, and also exceeds recent estimates of 3.6 -4.0 and 2.24 \u2013 3.58. Preliminary studies had estimated Ro as 1.5-3.5. Going by this value, on average every case of the Novel Coronavirus would give rise to 3 to 4 new cases. An outbreak with a reproductive number of below 1 will gradually disappear. The Ro for common flu is 1.3 and for SARS it was 2.0.\nEvacuation\nUS, Japan, India have evacuated their citizens trapped in China\u2019s affected areas\nCoronavirus: Mass Quarantine May Spark Irrational Fear, Anxiety, Stigma\nComparisons: Every year, an estimated 290,000 to 650,000 people die across the globe due to complications from seasonal influenza (flu) viruses. This figure corresponds to 795 to 1,781 deaths in a day owing to seasonal flu. SARS (Nov. 2002 \u2013 Jul. 2003) was a coronavirus with its origin in Beijing, China. It spread to 29 countries, and infected 8,096 people with 774 deaths (fatality rate of 9.6%). SARS infected 5,237 people in mainland China. Going by this figure, Wuhan Coronavirus surpassed SARS on January 29, 2020, when Chinese officials confirmed 5,974 cases of 2019-nCoV. On January 30, 2020 the novel coronavirus cases surpassed even the 8,096 cases worldwide representing the final SARS count in 2003.

        "content": "Like everyone else, I've been following the news about the latest new virus coming out of China. Unfortunately, most of the coverage has been about trivial, \"human interest\" matters---like the Canadians trapped in the Wuhan quarantine. Having said that, I have noticed a couple more important stories buried under the emotion-laden fluff. I thought it might be useful to mention them---hopefully more to reinforce than to originally inform. First of all, I noticed a story in the Toronto Star about health care workers concerned about the Doug Ford's decision to get rid of the previous Liberal government's legislation that gave everyone---even minimum wage people---at least two paid sick days a year. The other thing is that our dear Premier's legislation reinstated the idea that employers can force employees to go to a doctor's office to get a sick note. The sop that the Conservatives threw to workers is that everyone is entitled to three unpaid sick days a year. As was pointed out, this is a monumentally stupid state of affairs in a world where there things like infectious diseases and epidemics. It means that people have a very strong economic inducement to go to work when they are feeling sick. Among other things, this means that when you buy a meal from a restaurant, there is a good chance that one of the people handling your food will have a communicable disease which they can share with you. It also means that even if you are lucky to work in an environment with paid sick days you might be forced (as I was several times before I retired) to waste the time of an over-worked health care professional, to leave your home where you are resting (and isolated from the rest of the population), and, wait in a room full of similarly sick people (who might have compromised immune systems) so you can share your illness with them. Secondly, I noticed that experts on emerging infectious diseases were complaining that this new strain of disease had probably emerged when a disease endemic in bats managed to \"jump species\" into human beings. Why would it do so? Well, primarily because some human cultures have a weird tradition of eating \"wild animals\". I'm not talking about First Nations people hunting seals, caribou, etc---I'm talking about rich folks chowing down on, mmm, delicious bat soup. If you can believe this National Geographic article , China has temporarily banned this trade and lots of ordinary people there are pressuring the government to make this permanent. Here's a short Youtube video that shows the same thing in Indonesia. As the National Geographic article above points out, this is not an \"innately Chinese\" thing, but rather something that only a very small number of people do. It is completely and utterly different from what our indigenous people do, as the animals are kept alive, travel long distances, are sometimes factory farmed, and, sold by disgusting markets where many different species are kept \"cheek by jowl\" in appalling conditions. This has created a perfect situation to super-charge the evolution of new strains of infectious diseases for human beings. Just to give you an idea of how bizarre this situation is, there is also some evidence that the virus moved from bats to poisonous snakes (cobras or kraits) before being transmitted to humans. Snakes and bats are two of those species being jammed together in cages at these idiotic disease factories. &&&& One last bit of grotesque information. One of the problems that comes from these infectious diseases stems from the fact that in the modern neo-liberal paradise that we've created a lot of our basic research on things like vaccines is done by private drug companies. And the problem is that there's not a lot of money to be made by creating vaccines for emergent diseases. You do that by sending out \"germ hunters\" to poke around in places like wildlife markets to collect samples and try to figure out what might be the next nasty pathogen. Then these are sent to government laboratories that can classify, identify, sequence the genes, and, so lots of the time-consuming preliminary work that would allow someone to rapidly create a vaccine for it if it emerges as a public health problem. We also need to create infrastructure around the world to keep track of emergent diseases and speed up the response if a pandemic comes along. The problem from a business point of view is that almost none of this work will create any revenue because it is preventative . It might be the case that some corporation might end up with something that would end up being used by huge numbers of people---like the current flu vaccines. But the fact is, that there's no real way of knowing which particular disease that will be ahead of the nasty pandemic. And once we have a second \"black death\" knocking at our doors---given modern air travel---it might very well be too late to accomplish anything before huge numbers of people are already dead. According to an article I found in Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics there has been a push to create this sort of infrastructure. In response, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Economic Forum, Wellcome Trust and the governments of Norway and India co-founded the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in 2016, which aims to \u201cstimulate, finance and coordinate the development of vaccines against epidemic diseases, especially in cases in which market incentives alone are insufficient\u201d. Other entities, such as the governments of Germany and Japan, have since joined as investors. But it seems to me that it's kinda ridiculous that this is something that is being funded by a small number of countries and a couple charities instead of being something that every nation on earth (or at least every wealthy, technologically sophisticated nation) supports simply as a way of \"paying your dues\".&&&& Support indie media, subscribe through Patreon or Pay Pal .  Ultimately, this pandemic is just like the climate emergency. It's a symptom of human governments' inability to deal proactively with problems that are emerging from the dramatic expansion of human technology. Why is it that a scientist can't go to a government, explain this sort of problem, and, then get some action on it? Instead, we have to go through this crazy process where activists have to labouriously build consensus, fight back opportunist politicians who try to whip people into a frenzy of opposition, and, ultimately clean up the mess because we waited far, far too long to take rational action. The existing process simply takes too long and inevitably will lead to world-wide catastrophe.  Furthermore I say unto you, the Climate Emergency must be dealt with! ",

(Xinhua/Ju Peng) Xi said the situation at the moment remains very serious but expressed confidence that China can certainly obtain a full victory in the fight against the epidemic. As reported by Jia Zhao, Xu Lingui, Meng Na BEIJING, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, on Monday stressed resolutely winning the people's war against pneumonia epidemic caused by the novel coronavirus. Wearing a mask, Xi, also Chinese president and chairman of the Central Military Commission, visited a residential community, a hospital and a district center for disease control and prevention in Beijing. The inspection came at a time when many people outside the epidemic center of Hubei Province resumed work after an extended holiday.

(Xinhua/Xie Huanchi) XI THE COMMANDER - Xi is the commander of the people's war against the epidemic. Over the past few weeks, he has called multiple meetings, heard reports, made important instructions on the prevention and control work and discussed the topic with foreign leaders. One message is consistent and crystal clear: People always come first. Xi has stressed putting people's lives and health as the top priority. On Jan. 25, Xi chaired a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and demanded that epidemic prevention and control be taken as the most important task. In the last week of January, Xi entrusted senior officials to inspect epidemic control work in Wuhan, made instructions to Party organizations, members and officials as well as the military and met with the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. In early February, Xi again chaired a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on epidemic prevention and control and later a high-level meeting on overall law-based governance, requiring strong legal guarantee to epidemic control. Under Xi's leadership, China has carried out national mobilization, across-the-board deployment and swift responses, adopted the most comprehensive and rigorous prevention and control measures and launched a people's war against the epidemic. Though the battle remains arduous, especially in Hubei, the number of daily new confirmed cases outside the province has been dropping for six consecutive days since Feb. 4. In the past week, Xi also discussed epidemic control when he met with Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen in Beijing and spoke over the phone with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Sau d and U.S. President Donald Trump respectively. Xi told King Salman that the strong measures China has taken are not only responsible for the health of the Chinese people, but have also made huge contributions to the world's public safety. According to statistics of the WHO, the outbreak has affected about two dozens countries but all with limited cases. \"We would have seen many more cases outside China...if it were not for the (Chinese) government's efforts and the progress they have made to protect their own people and the people of the world,\" Tedros, the WHO chief, said.

        "content": "Today the official count of confirmed cases of 2019 Corona virus, originating in Wuhan, China stands at 9776 with 213 deaths.\nSeveral medical professionals, have gone on record in the last week stating these numbers do not make sense based on the number of cases exported to other countries.\nThe latest publication (Jan 31, 2020) in the Lancet has this to say:\nBackground Since Dec 31, 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions.\nMethods We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23\u201324, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\nFindings In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2\u00b768 (95% CrI 2\u00b747\u20132\u00b786) and that 75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304\u2013130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6\u00b74 days (95% CrI 5\u00b78\u20137\u00b71). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227\u2013805), 113 (57\u2013193), 98 (49\u2013168), 111 (56\u2013191), and 80 (40\u2013139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1\u20132 weeks.\nInterpretation Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately . Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally. My view is the Chinese government is lying about the severity of the epidemic, which has the potential to become a global pandemic. The 75,800 infections as of Jan 25th mentioned in the article in conjunction with the 6.4 day rate of doubling, suggest over 150,000 current infections. The authorities seem very keen on downplaying the problem, to the point of arm twisting the World Health Organization to state that travel to China should remain unrestricted. Watching the live news conference of WHO yesterday was a rather sickening event as the director gushed and fawned over what a good job the Chinese authorities had done in preventing the spread of the virus and how transparent they are about the epidemic. The director had met president Xi himself on the matter.\nDespite China's severe authoritarianism, anecdotal evidence continues to leak out that the outbreak is much more severe, hospitals are overrun with patients, medical staff is overwhelmed, medical supplies have run out, and virus victims are being left to fend for themselves, sometimes locked into their own apartments.\nIn our view, the market is underestimating the impact of the virus, thinking it will be mostly over in a week or so. Given the numbers, our view is a secondary outbreak, outside of China is likely within the next month unless serious restrictions are placed on travel and victims of this virus are quarantined . ",

        "content": "The Canadian Centre for Child Protection fielded 80 priority reports to the tip line, up from about 15 on any busy weekend before the pandemic, over one weekend in mid-April In dark web forums, sexual predators are increasingly discussing the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to exploit children online as they spend more time out of school and on the internet. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection is seeing an increase in talk among predators and a spike in activity on its tip line for reporting online sexual exploitation of children, said Signy Arnason, the centre\u2019s associate executive director .\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that you\u2019re seeing an uptick \u2013 a significant uptick \u2013 in chatter related to taking advantage of COVID-19,\u201d Ms. Arnason said. \u201cIt\u2019s really like a heyday for offenders.\u201d\nStory continues below advertisement\nOver one weekend in mid-April, the centre fielded 80 priority reports to the tip line, up from about 15 on any busy weekend before the pandemic, she said. Still, reports to the tip line don\u2019t capture the entire scope of the problem because many children don\u2019t know that their images have been stored and shared, she added.\nA few days later, UNICEF issued a strong warning about the heightened risk of online sexual exploitation during a lockdown. The organization is urging technology companies to improve the safety features of their platforms and asking governments to step up awareness initiatives. Reports of child sexual exploitation to tip lines across the world have increased an average of 30 per cent amid the pandemic, according to InHope, a global network of cyber tip lines, as first reported by NBC News.\nOnline sexual exploitation can refer to children who are abused in their homes and then have images of the abuse distributed online, as well as children who are sexually exploited through online interactions.\nPredators who attempt to collect nude images or sexual videos of children on livestreaming platforms \u2013 \u201ccappers,\u201d they call themselves \u2013 share techniques and encouragement within communities on the dark web, according to the centre.\nIn a typical scenario, a capper would target a boy using a \u201cbait\u201d video \u2013 often showing a girl undressing \u2013 using specialized software to give the boy the impression that he is livestreaming with a female peer rather than an adult male.\nThe predator would then direct the boy to perform sexual acts, recording the livestream for distribution online. Some predators will extort children for money or additional sexual images by threatening to release pictures and videos they already have online or to family and friends.\n\u201cIf you cant find a boy right now your catfish [bait] video either sucks or you have zero idea how to talk to teens,\u201d commented one predator recently in a dark web forum captured by the centre. \u201cOmegle has literally been bursting at the seams in the last 2 weeks with boys,\u201d wrote another, referring to a popular website for anonymous chatting.\nStory continues below advertisement\nGirls are more often targeted for sexual grooming, which can involve predators complimenting them and creating the illusion of a relationship, Ms. Arnason said.\nA message for all children is that they should never appear nude on webcams or livestreams, she said.\nPredators can reach children on well-known apps such as TikTok and Instagram, as well as gaming interfaces such as Roblox and Discord; websites such as Omegle; and apps such as Cake and Sarahah, which have been the focus of safety alerts from the centre\u2019s tip line, Cybertip.ca.\nSergeant Arnold Guerin, who works in the technology section of the RCMP\u2019s National Child Exploitation Crime Centre, said his team is also tracking a rise in conversation among predators, who were \u201cgleeful and delighted\u201d about children having more screen time, often unsupervised.\nHe emphasized the importance of parents having conversations with their children about the internet and said that focusing on whether certain platforms are worse than others isn\u2019t particularly helpful.\n\u201cWhat is more helpful advice is to be really involved in your child\u2019s online community,\u201d Sgt. Guerin said. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to go to your kids and say, \u2018Hey, I don\u2019t know anything about Snapchat. Can you tell me what a private story is?'\" (They can only be viewed by people the Snapchat user has selected.)\nStory continues below advertisement\nChildren should not accept social media contacts and friend requests from strangers, Sgt. Guerin said, acknowledging that this is difficult for a lot of kids who want more likes on their content.\nStaff Sergeant Sharon Hanlon, manager of the Ontario Provincial Police\u2019s Child Sexual Exploitation Unit, said a common issue is children doing stunts to get more likes, such as momentarily dropping their pants, not realizing how their images could later be used. (A spokeswoman for the Toronto Police Service, Meaghan Gray, said the force\u2019s child exploitation unit has noticed an increase in children voluntarily posting images that could be used by an adult for exploitative purposes.)\nStaff Sgt. Hanlon recommended that families download a free resource called Understanding Child Sexual Abuse , which was created by the Canadian Centre for Child Protection. \u201cAn informed public is the best defence against the sexual exploitation of children,\u201d she added.\nIn 2016, the centre launched Project Arachnid, a platform that automatically searches, or \u201ccrawls,\u201d links reported to the centre\u2019s tip line and sends notices to technology companies to remove identified child sexual abuse material. Last year, the centre received about 35,000 reports to its tip line and sent more than 1.3 million removal notifications to electronic service providers.\nIn early March, five countries, including the United States and Canada, released a set of 11 voluntary principles for technology companies to counter online child sexual exploitation and abuse. They include calling on companies to prevent child sexual abuse material from being made available on their platforms, identify exploitation facilitated by livestreaming and introduce stronger safety mechanisms.\nThough parents and guardians have an important role to play in prevention, Ms. Arnason said the notion that they can know everything their kids are doing online is \u201cludicrous.\u201d\nStory continues below advertisement\n\u201cIt allows industry to get off the hook for the fact that they have not put in place the measures that are needed,\u201d she said.\nOnline sexual exploitation of children can be reported to Cybertip.ca, Canada\u2019s national tip line. Information about a child who is in immediate danger should be reported to 911.\nOur Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day\u2019s most important headlines.

On Thursday, 44 additional cases of the new coronavirus were confirmed on board the Diamond Princess, raising the total number of cases on the ship to 218.

Why there is such a delay is coordinating [with Japanese authorities] and sending help? I want my daughter back safe and I urge the government to do something,\u201d said Dinesh Thakkar, a real estate agent. \u201cShe is not carrying the virus but we are scared because the infection is spreading quickly on the ship. If there are more delays, she could be infected,\u201d he added. Dinesh Thakkar said his daughter started working on cruise ships in 2018 and joined Diamond Princess, which is managed by Princess Cruise Lines and owned by Miami-based Carnival Corp, in December 2019. \u201cI talk to my daughter via video call every day. She has been quarantined in a cabin with another security officer. She can\u2019t go anywhere, because right now there are 218 passengers who have tested positive for the virus,\u201d he added. Coronavirus Impact: Streets in Wuhan, China left desolate 1 6 Wuhan under lockdown\nThe highly-contagious coronavirus has pushed cities to go under lockdown, leaving streets desolate, almost making them ghost towns. Residents of Wuhan in China have taken precaution from contracting the disease by staying indoors and avoiding human contact. The virus first originated in China's Wuhan and has now spread to several countries such as Japan, Singapore and India. More than 1380 people have died as per official figures released by China. The spread of the highly contagious virus has severly impacted not just normal life but also commerce in Wuhan. Photo: Getty Images Rising death toll\nCurrently, the death toll in mainland China stands at 1,380 and the number of confirmed cases has reached 63,851. China's National Health Commission also added that out of the 5,090 new cases reported on Thursday, 4,823 cases were from Hubei province. The province is considered to be the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. Photo: Getty Images A massive loss\nAs concerns grown on the spread of the virus, countries have issued advisories to citizens travelling in and out of China, Thailand, Singapore and Japan. Airlines have suspended services to multiple cities in China, leading to a massive loss in the industry as well as the tourism sector. The International Civil Aviation Organisation said that this could lead to a USD 4-5 billion drop in worldwide airline revenue. About 70 airlines have cancelled all international flights in and out of China, the UN agency reported.

As the world celebrates Valentine's Day, Chinese couples have opted against the traditional bouquet of flowers and candle-lit dinners in fear of contracting the virus. Many chose to make the most of their time at home instead. Photo: Getty Images Wedding industry takes a hit\nAn employee at a flower store in China added that sales had dropped to 50 per cent due to lack of business. The country's wedding industry also took a hit, with the government urging couples to delay their ceremony due to the virus. Photo: Getty Images WHO teams arrives in China\nWhile Japan has reported its first death due to the disease, India has confirmed three cases so far. To tackle the spread of the virus, a 15-member advance WHO team arrived in China on Monday. Photo: Getty Images Meanwhile, in some good news for the 3,700-odd passengers and crew of Diamond Princess, Japan said it would allow some elderly people who have tested negative for the coronavirus to disembark ahead of schedule. Japan\u2019s Health Minister Katsunobu Kato announced on Thursday that elderly passengers who have pre-existing conditions or are in windowless rooms would be allowed to leave starting from Friday, rather than the originally targeted date of February 19. They will complete their quarantine onshore. About 80% of the ship\u2019s passengers are aged 60 or over, with 215 in their 80s and 11 in their 90s, according to Japanese media. The ship typically has a crew of 1,100 and a passenger capacity of 2,670.",

        "content": "A new expert panel consensus statement published simultaneously today in the journals Radiology: Imaging Cancer, Chest and the Journal of the American College of Radiology provides guidance to clinicians managing lung cancer screening programs and patients with lung nodules during the COVID-19 pandemic. In many parts of the world, the COVID-19 public health crisis has stressed the health care system close to or even past its breaking point. Hospital resources are focused on the immediate needs of patients suffering from the disease, particularly those who are critically ill. The strain on health care systems and the need to control the virus using containment and mitigation has impacted the care of patients with other common medical disorders. Clinicians have been forced to balance the risk of delaying potentially necessary exams against the risk of exposing patients to the virus in hospital settings or exposing health care workers to patients who may be asymptomatic carriers of the disease. This is further complicated by the re-allocation of resources, including hospital personnel, to evaluate and treat patients with COVID-19.\n\"The potential risk of exposure or transmission during routine care, as well as the diversion of resources to help combat the pandemic, has forced clinicians to make decisions about the timing of care,\" said Peter J. Mazzone, M.D., M.P.H., FCCP, director of the Lung Cancer Program and Lung Cancer Screening Program for the Cleveland Clinic Respiratory Institute. \"This document provides guidance that we hope will help with these decisions. It outlines acceptable variances from standard practice during the pandemic and provides items to consider that could influence the decisions for a given patient.\"\nPerforming a lung cancer screening exam or the evaluation of lung nodules both carry additional risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is added risk to the patient, other patients and health care providers from exposure to the health care environment and the contact that occurs during testing. Recovery from surgical resection may be influenced by asymptomatic carriage of the virus. These added risks may upset the balance of benefit and harm struck by current (pre-COVID) guideline recommendations. There is also a shift in health care resources, toward canceling elective procedures and imaging, in areas where\nCOVID-19 is surging, or where systems are preparing for a surge, making it more difficult to adhere to available guidelines. These exposure risks and resource constraints have led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to suggest that non-urgent care be deferred.\nTo date, clinicians and hospital systems have been independently determining how to modify their screening and lung nodule management programs during the pandemic. The consensus statement was developed to provide expert opinion to clinicians regarding the performance of lung cancer screening and the management of patients with lung nodules in a manner that is consistent with current CDC COVID-19 guidance. Three project leaders and 21 panel members participated in developing the consensus statement. Their specialties included pulmonology, thoracic radiology and thoracic surgery. Twelve scenarios were developed, each with a statement requiring a vote. The voting results for all statements exceeded the threshold of 70% of panel members voting agree or strongly agree. Scenarios recommendations and notes are included in the report.\nConsensus was unanimous for recommendations to delay baseline or repeat annual screening, and over 95% of panelists agreed to delay the evaluation of pulmonary nodules detected incidentally or by screening that have a low probability of cancer or are likely to be an indolent cancer.\nConsensus was less uniform but still strong for recommendations to delay or modify the evaluation and management of patients with nodules measuring greater than 8 millimeters in average diameter.\nThe authors note that these recommendations are not \"one-size-fits-all\" and state that patient preferences should be considered in all of the scenarios, because individual patients are likely to differ in how they perceive the potential benefits and harms associated with delayed or modified evaluation and management.\nThe paper points out that due to the fluidity of the situation, it is not possible at this time to determine when it will be advisable to return to usual care practices.\n\"We hope these statements are helpful and provide some reassurance and direction to individuals who are eligible for lung cancer screening, patients with lung nodules, and the clinicians who care for them,\" the authors conclude.\nRSNA is committed to connecting radiologists and the radiology community to the most timely and useful COVID-19 information and resources. RSNA's COVID-19 Resources page houses the latest guidance, original research, image collection and more. The page will be updated on an ongoing basis.",

The current count of cases of infection with 2019-nCoV in the United States and globally can be monitored at www.healthlynked.com/corona-virus-tracker .\nAbout the Corona Virus:\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a new virus that causes respiratory illness in people and can spread from person-to-person. This virus originated in Wuhan , China and likely originally emerged from an animal source but now seems to be spreading from person-to-person. It is important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so.\nAt this time, it is unclear how easily this virus is spreading between people, but concerns are that individuals that are infected can spread the virus before symptoms occur and after they have recovered. You can learn more of what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses at\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html .\nThe greatest risk of infection is for people in China or people who have traveled to China . Risk of infection is dependent on exposure. Patients with 2019-nCoV have reportedly had mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms of: fever, cough and shortness of breath with many patients having developed pneumonia in both lungs.\nThe best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. There are simple everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including the following: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.\nIf you are sick, to keep from spreading respiratory illness to others, you should: Stay home whe you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. If you were in China within the past 14 days and feel sick with fever, cough, or are having difficulty breathing, you should get medical care. Call the office of your health care provider before you go and tell them about your recent travels and your symptoms. They will give you instructions on how to get care without exposing other people to your illness. While sick, avoid contact with people, don't go out and delay any travel to reduce the possibility of spreading illness to others.\nThere is currently no vaccine to protect against 2019-nCoV. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus.\nDr. Michael Dent , HealthLynked CEO stated \"The Corona Virus infection is a global health crisis and helping identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus and can infect others is the primary method to prevent further spread. The WHO provides updated statistics on new confirmed infections. So far in the US there are only 8 confirmed cases, but concerns are high that the virus will spread in the US as it has in China. We strongly encourage everyone to create a free HealthLynked profile so that they have easy access to their medical information in case they require medical attention.\"\n\"Wearing a protective mask is one way to reduce exposure to airborne virus and they are in short supply.

[BORJA SUAREZ/REUTERS] Asian people living in France have taken to social media to complain about the way they have been treated in the wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak.\nNetizens have used the hashtag JeNeSuisPasUnVirus (I'm not a virus), among others, to complain about having been abused on public transport, on social media, and in the street.\nThe apparent increase in anti-Asian sentiment followed the central France-based newspaper Le Courier Picard using inflammatory headlines that included \"Alerte jaune\" (Yellow alert) and \"Le peril jaune?\" (Yellow peril?), the BBC reported.\nThe broadcaster said there have been similar reports in the United Kingdom and in other countries of an increase in anti-Asian racism.\nWhen called out, Le Courier Picard apologized for its headlines and admitted they were examples of the \"worst Asian stereotypes\".\nLou Chengwang took to Twitter to tell his neighbors: \"I'm Chinese, but I'm not a virus! I know everyone's scared of the virus but no prejudice, please.\"\nAnd Cathy Tran used the same hashtag to describe an exchange between two men in the northeastern town of Colmar. She said she heard them say: \"Watch out, a Chinese girl is coming our way.\"\nOn another occasion, she said, a man on a scooter told her to wear a face mask.\nAnother social media user said people should \"stop asking if we're dangerous if we cough while all the people around us are doing so\".\nReuters reports that customers have frequently asked Pascal Corlier, the owner of a Vietnamese restaurant in Paris, whether any of his serving staff are Chinese.\n\"There's a sort of unfounded psychosis setting in around the Asian community and Asian food,\" he said, while noting that his takings are about 40 percent down on where they should be.\nLaetitia Chhiv, who runs an association for young people of Chinese descent, told Reuters: \"We had a student of Chinese origin in Strasbourg who was shouted at by a woman who told him not to touch the avocados she wanted to buy. That was after she asked him where he was from and whether he had the virus.\"\nIn Toronto, Canada, concerns about rising anti-Asian sentiment prompted city councilors and Chinese community leaders to call a news conference last week in order to remind residents that people of Asian descent are no more likely to have the virus than anyone else.\nFrench-born Sun-Lay Tan, who is of Chinese and Cambodian descent, said: \"Racism against Asians is spreading even faster than the virus. I was sitting on the metro on my way to work and the person next to me edged a few centimeters away and put his scarf over his mouth. I was shocked.\"\nCorlier, the owner of the Vietnamese restaurant in Paris, said \"people are panicking\".\nHe said it is hard to hold that against them.\n\"But they have to take a step back... and look at the facts.\"\nMeanwhile, several EU nations imposed increased checks at borders on incoming Chinese visitors.\nSome nations, including Italy, the United States, Australia, have even banned the arrival of visitors from China and introduced a requirement on their own citizens who have visited China to be quarantined upon their return.",

The new testing method developed by a research team at IIT Delhi will make COVID-19 testing significantly cheaper and thereby be available to more number of people. The approval to the new testing technique developed by a team of researchers from IIT Delhi was approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which is leading India\u2019s fight against the Coronavirus pandemic. IIT Delhi \u2013 First Academic Institute To Receive ICMR Approval\nAccording to details available right now, the premier technology institute i.e. IIT Dlehi is the only academic institute so far which has received ICMR approval for a unique testing methodology for COVID-19. Earlier, a research team from the institute had announced that it had developed a new real-time PCR-based diagnostic assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 aka the virus which causes COVID-19. Now, with ICMR approval in place, the institute can ramp up its development and production of the COVI0-19 real-time PCR-based diagnostic assay test kits to help India test more number of people. IIT Delhi\u2019s COVID-19 Test Kits to be Probe Free\nUnlike the usual test kits for Coronavirus which are based on probe-based testing protocol, the testing method developed by IIT Delhi Researchers is probe free. It is based on PCR-based diagnostic assay, which will significantly bring down the test cost without compromising on the accuracy of the test results. A senior official from IIT Delhi has also been reported as saying by the PTI news agency that the test kit development by IIT Delhi researchers is the first probe free assay for COVID-19 that has received ICMR\u2019s approval.\nThe approval of ICMR to IIT Delhi\u2019s new testing technique or method for COVID-19 testing comes in the backdrop of the council halting testing for Coronavirus using the \u2018faulty\u2019 anti-body test kits imported from China. These imported test kits have shown variation in results and have not been effecting in helping agencies track the spread of the virus in hotspot areas. ",

        "content": "The outbreak of corona virus in China, although in its ascending phase, may threaten global recovery, especially considering that the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak cost the world $57 billion (at current price level), says a research note from State Bank of India (SBI). In the report, Dr Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser of SBI, says, \"The new virus is of same genre as SARS virus of 2003. Although the fatality is low, the new virus has progressed at a much faster pace than 2003 SARS case. The impact of outbreak on China will be severe as Wuhan is the hub of transport and industry for central China. The total cost of SARS outbreak in 2003 at current prices is around $57 billion. Epidemiology models suggest the current disease is in ascending phase hence it is difficult to assess the full impact at this stage.\" The Pneumonia of unknown cause was first reported in WHO Disease outbreak news on 5 January 2020. By 12th January, the outbreak was confirmed. The new virus is of same genre as SARS virus of 2003. The studies on economic impact of SARS virus of 2003 suggest that the outbreak had impacted industries such as tourism and the retail service sector. \"With sudden shift in expenditure priority growth will be affected in China and globally,\" SBI says. In addition, the report says, unless the impact of novel corona virus is factored in to as events were coterminous, the analysis of the US and China deal and its impact on global economy would be incomplete. On 15 January 2020 the US and China signed the first economic and trade agreement by signalling the intent to end the economic and trade hostility that has marred the bilateral relationship for over two years. The trade agreement signed on 15th January is broadly divided into seven parts and covers a wide range of agreements and roadmaps on protection of intellectual property (IPR), transfer of technology on market-based principles and trade. It is agreed that over 2017 baseline, China will import $200 billion of goods and financial services for the first two years. At the highest level, the agreement brings some clarity on US-China side of US-China-India triangle. For the global economy the growth expectations improve but marginally. The upside is limited as trade disputes are just one of the many structural problems. Commenting on the impact of the deal on US dollar and US interest rates, SBI says, \"The deal envisages reducing the Sino-US trade deficit by 48% for its level in 2018 and hence one can expect that if the deal proceeds as planned US dollar will appreciate over time. The direction of interest rates will be conditional on three vectors - the US fiscal deficit, the progressive decline in forex reserve accretion of China and other factors such as inflation. Of late the interbank liquidity in the US was in deficit. Thus, all factors indicate marginal rise in bond yields in the US.\" \"However, on the other side, with global food prices at 71 month high and trend likely to continue central banks in emerging economies could make an unsynchronized exit from easy monetary policy. This could mean a weakening US dollar. In balance, we expect pressure on US dollar with risks tilted towards the downside as now,\" Dr Ghosh from SBI added. For India, SBI says, the mood swing in financial markets on account of aggressive posturing by the either side will become less and thus, some order is expected in the global forex markets and Indian rupee will have an appreciating bias.",

        "content": "The second meeting of the Emergency Committee convened by the WHO Director-General under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) regarding the outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019 in the People\u2019s Republic of China, with exportations to other countries, took place on Thursday, 30 January 2020, from 13:30 to 18:35 Geneva time (CEST). The Committee\u2019s role is to give advice to the Director-General, who makes the final decision on the determination of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Committee also provides public health advice or suggests formal Temporary Recommendations as appropriate.\nProceedings of the meeting Members and advisors of the Emergency Committee were convened by teleconference\nThe Director-General welcomed the Committee and thanked them for their support. He turned the meeting over to the Chair, Professor Didier Houssin.\nProfessor Houssin also welcomed the Committee and gave the floor to the Secretariat.\nA representative of the department of compliance, risk management, and ethics briefed the Committee members on their roles and responsibilities.\nCommittee members were reminded of their duty of confidentiality and their responsibility to disclose personal, financial, or professional connections that might be seen to constitute a conflict of interest. Each member who was present was surveyed and no conflicts of interest were judged to be relevant to the meeting. There were no changes since the previous meeting.\nThe Chair then reviewed the agenda for the meeting and introduced the presenters.\nRepresentatives of the Ministry of Health of the People\u2019s Republic of China reported on the current situation and the public health measures being taken. There are now 7711 confirmed and 12167 suspected cases throughout the country. Of the confirmed cases, 1370 are severe and 170 people have died. 124 people have recovered and been discharged from hospital.\nThe WHO Secretariat provided an overview of the situation in other countries. There are now 83 cases in 18 countries. Of these, only 7 had no history of travel in China. There has been human-to-human transmission in 3 countries outside China. One of these cases is severe and there have been no deaths.\nAt its first meeting, the Committee expressed divergent views on whether this event constitutes a PHEIC or not. At that time, the advice was that the event did not constitute a PHEIC, but theCommittee members agreed on the urgency of the situation and suggested that the Committee should continue its meeting on the next day, when it reached the same conclusion.\nThis second meeting takes place in view of significant increases in numbers of cases and additional countries reporting confirmed cases.\nConclusions and advice The Committee welcomed the leadership and political commitment of the very highest levels of Chinese government, their commitment to transparency, and the efforts made to investigate and contain the current outbreak. China quickly identified the virus and shared its sequence, so that other countries could diagnose it quickly and protect themselves, which has resulted in the rapid development of diagnostic tools.\nThe very strong measures the country has taken include daily contact with WHO and comprehensive multi-sectoral approaches to prevent further spread. It has also taken public health measures in other cities and provinces; is conducting studies on the severity and transmissibility of the virus, and sharing data and biological material. The country has also agreed to work with other countries who need their support. The measures China has taken are good not only for that country but also for the rest of the world.\nThe Committee acknowledged the leading role of WHO and its partners.\nThe Committee also acknowledged that there are still many unknowns, cases have now been reported in five WHO regions in one month, and human-to-human transmission has occurred outside Wuhan and outside China.\nThe Committee believes that it is still possible to interrupt virus spread, provided that countries put in place strong measures to detect disease early, isolate and treat cases, trace contacts, and promote social distancing measures commensurate with the risk. It is important to note that as the situation continues to evolve, so will the strategic goals and measures to prevent and reduce spread of the infection. The Committee agreed that the outbreak now meets the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and proposed the following advice to be issued as Temporary Recommendations.\nThe Committee emphasized that the declaration of a PHEIC should be seen in the spirit of support and appreciation for China, its people, and the actions China has taken on the frontlines of this outbreak, with transparency, and, it is to be hoped, with success. In line with the need for global solidarity, the Committee felt that a global coordinated effort is needed to enhance preparedness in other regions of the world that may need additional support for that.\nAdvice to WHO The Committee welcomed a forthcoming WHO multidisciplinary technical mission to China, including national and local experts. The mission should review and support efforts to investigate the animal source of the outbreak, the clinical spectrum of the disease and its severity, the extent of human-to-human transmission in the community and in healthcare facilities, and efforts to control the outbreak. This mission will provide information to the international community to aid in understanding the situation and its impact and enable sharing of experience and successful measures.\nThe Committee wished to re-emphasize the importance of studying the possible source, to rule out hidden transmission and to inform risk management measures\nThe Committee also emphasized the need for enhanced surveillance in regions outside Hubei, including pathogen genomic sequencing, to understand whether local cycles of transmission are occurring.\nWHO should continue to use its networks of technical experts to assess how best this outbreak can be contained globally.\nWHO should provide intensified support for preparation and response, especially in vulnerable countries and regions.\nMeasures to ensure rapid development and access to potential vaccines, diagnostics, antiviral medicines and other therapeutics for low- and middle-income countries should be developed.\nWHO should continue to provide all necessary technical and operational support to respond to this outbreak, including with its extensive networks of partners and collaborating institutions, to implement a comprehensive risk communication strategy, and to allow for the advancement of research and scientific developments in relation to this novel coronavirus.\nWHO should continue to explore the advisability of creating an intermediate level of alert between the binary possibilities of PHEIC or no PHEIC, in a way that does not require reopening negotiations on the text of the IHR (2005).\nWHO should timely review the situation with transparency and update its evidence-based recommendations.\nThe Committee does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available.\nThe Director-General declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a PHEIC and accepted the Committee\u2019s advice and issued this advice as Temporary Recommendations under the IHR.\nTo the People\u2019s Republic of China Continue to:\n\u2022 Implement a comprehensive risk communication strategy to regularly inform the population on the evolution of the outbreak, the prevention and protection measures for the population, and the response measures taken for its containment.\n\u2022 Enhance public health measures for containment of the current outbreak.\n\u2022 Ensure the resilience of the health system and protect the health workforce.\n\u2022 Enhance surveillance and active case finding across China.\n\u2022 Collaborate with WHO and partners to conduct investigations to understand the epidemiology and the evolution of this outbreak and measures to contain it.\n\u2022 Share relevant data on human cases.\n\u2022 Continue to identify the zoonotic source of the outbreak, and particularly the potential for circulation with WHO as soon as it becomes available.\n\u2022 Conduct exit screening at international airports and ports, with the aim of early detection of symptomatic travelers for further evaluation and treatment, while minimizing interference with international traffic.\nTo all countries It is expected that further international exportation of cases may appear in any country. Thus, all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of 2019-nCoVinfection, and to share full data with WHO. Technical advice is available on the WHO website .\nCountries are reminded that they are legally required to share information with WHO under the IHR.\nAny detection of 2019-nCoV in an animal (including information about the species, diagnostic tests, and relevant epidemiological information) should be reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as an emerging disease.\nCountries should place particular emphasis on reducing human infection, prevention of secondary transmission and international spread, and contributing to the international response though multi-sectoral communication and collaboration and active participation in increasing knowledge on the virus and the disease, as well as advancing research.\nThe Committee does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available.\nCountries must inform WHO about travel measures taken, as required by the IHR. Countries are cautioned against actions that promote stigma or discrimination, in line with the principles of Article 3 of the IHR.\nThe Committee asked the Director-General to provide further advice on these matters and, if necessary, to make new case-by-case recommendations, in view of this rapidly evolving situation.\nTo the global community As this is a new coronavirus, and it has been previously shown that similar coronaviruses required substantial efforts to enable regular information sharing and research, the global community should continue to demonstrate solidarity and cooperation, in compliance with Article 44 of the IHR (2005), in supporting each other on the identification of the source of this new virus, its full potential for human-to-human transmission, preparedness for potential importation of cases, and research for developing necessary treatment.\nProvide support to low- and middle-income countries to enable their response to this event, as well as to facilitate access to diagnostics, potential vaccines and therapeutics.\nUnder Article 43 of the IHR, States Parties implementing additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic (refusal of entry or departure of international travellers, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods, and the like, or their delay, for more than 24 hours) are obliged to send to WHO the public health rationale and justification within 48 hours of their implementation. WHO will review the justification and may request countries to reconsider their measures. WHO is required to share with other States Parties the information about measures and the justification received.\nThe Emergency Committee will be reconvened within three months or earlier, at the discretion of the Director-General.\nThe Director-General thanked the Committee for its work.",

As of Tuesday, a total of 295 cases of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus had been reported in China and neighbouring countries. 2 cases confirmed in Thailand ans 1 each in Japan and South Korea. Meanwhile, Emergency Committee of World Health Organisation, WHO, has convened a meeting under International Health Regulations in Geneva on Wednesday to discuss the recent outbreak of coronavirus in China. Confirming China\u2019s attendance in the meeting, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokerperson told the media in Beijing today that China will continue to deepen international cooperation and work together with international communtiry to deal with the epidemic. At the meeting tomorrow, the Committee will determine whether the outbreak constitutes a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d and the recommendations to manage it. Chinese officials have confirmed that the virus can be transmitted between humans which has become cause of major concern for the health officials. Officials however added that it can be halted with increased vigilance. Chinese President Xi Jinping has also said that it must be taken very seriously. As per the WHO website, if it is declared a public health emergency of international concern, the Emergency Committee will be empowered to recommend measures to be taken within the country or by other countries, to reduce the spread of disease. China\u2019s official news agency Xinhua has reported that Wuhan city administration has taken a string of measures to tighten the control and monitoring of outbound travelers in an effort to curb the spread of new coronavirus-related pneumonia. It has enforced entry & exit controls ahead of peak travel season and has established headquarters for the control and treatment of the pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus. Outbound tour groups have been banned, and local police are conducting spot checks on inbound and outbound private passenger vehicles for live poultry or wild animals. Thirty-five stationary infrared thermometers and over 300 hand-held ones have been used to screen passengers with fevers at various transport terminals in Wuhan, including the airport, railway stations, bus stations and passenger piers. Passengers with fevers will be registered, provided masks and brochures about pneumonia and advised to see doctors. Ticket cancellations and changing will be free of charge for them. ",

        "content": "Infectious diseases represent an important portion of global public health concerns\u00b8 in particular with regard to the current global outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The challenge of frontline diagnosis in hospitals, clinics and ports is that infectious diseases could exhibit similar symptoms or can be asymptomatic. The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) today announced the development of the world's most comprehensive automated multiplex diagnostic system (the System) which includes a fully automated machine and a multiplex full-screening panel for the point-of-care genetic testing (POCT) of respiratory infectious disease including the 2019-nCoV.\n(From left) Prof. Terence Lau of PolyU, Prof. Alexander Wai, Vice President (Research Development) of PolyU, and Dr Manson Fok, Chairman of the Board of Avalon Biomedical Management Ltd, present the automated multiplex diagnostic system. In one single test and within approximately one hour, the System can identify 30 to 40 pathogens including seasonal influenza viruses, such as influenza A subtypes H1, H2 and H3; avian influenza viruses H5, H7 and H9; human respiratory syncytial virus; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV); Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and 2019-nCoV. Leveraging the current polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, the system is fully automated from sample nucleic acid extraction and amplification, to signal detection and analysis. The System adopts patent-pending microfluidic and biochemical technologies that achieve ultra-sensitive detection (down to 5 gene copies) and simultaneous differentiation of various pathogens with extremely high specificity. It is also user-friendly, with manual handling not being required throughout the testing process.\n\"Early and accurate detection of pathogens could contribute to effective and efficient disease control and management, and prevent spreading of any contagious pathogens. It benefits the patients as well because timely therapy can then be applied to prevent complications. The existing challenge is that we lack full panel POCT technologies for early and on-site diagnosis, which should ideally be capable of differentiating between different pathogens at the same time. This newly-developed system could be a practical solution,\" said Professor Lau.\nPolyU and The University of Hong Kong (HKU) have established the Respiratory Virus Research Foundation (\"the Foundation\") in 2015 and have since then been working on various innovative technologies to tackle existing and emerging respiratory infectious diseases. The Foundation has fostered various collaborations, including those on vaccine and rapid diagnostics respectively. The former is led by HKU Professor Yuen Kwok-yung, Henry Fok Professor in Infectious Diseases, Chair Professor of Infectious Diseases from the Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine; the latter is led by PolyU Professor Terence Lau Lok -ting, Director of Innovation and Technology Development and Adjunct Professor at the Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology.\nIr. Professor Alexander Wai Ping -kong, Vice President (Research Development), Deputy President and Provost designate of PolyU, said, \"In this difficult and challenging time that Hong Kong , the Chinese mainland, and even the global community is encountering, it is important that the research community can quickly pool their expertise and resources to develop practical solutions. The PolyU-HKU partnership is a prime example of effective coupling of multidisciplinary innovation and translation.\"\nThe research team for this project is led by PolyU Professor Terence Lau Lok -ting and supported by HKU Professor Yuen Kwok-yung. Through collaborative efforts, the team has spent the past four years to develop the System. In the past year, the team has optimised the System and conducted trials on different clinical samples. In the midst of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, the team has also conducted tests on clinical samples using the system.\nProfessor Yuen commented, \"The System's versatility and capability will provide for comprehensive monitoring during disease outbreaks or routine surveillance. It will become a crucial technology for ensuring the effective control of infectious diseases, medical diagnosis, and treatment.\"\n\"This fully automated, quantitative rapid diagnostic platform possesses a proprietary technology which overcomes limitations of existing technologies by ensuring sensitivity -- and hence significantly enhancing the reliability of test results. Most importantly, our innovation can substantially reduce the cost of the microfluidic cartridge manufacturing thus making it feasible for wide adoption. It is ready for mass-scale production,\" added Professor Lau.\nThe research team has received indispensable support from a local biotechnology company Avalon Biomedical Management Ltd for this project. \"We are honoured to be able to participate in this project and are delighted to see this important milestone in the collaboration between Professor Lau and Professor Yuen. We believe this advanced point-of-care diagnostic system can revolutionize the current diagnostic paradigm and provide a powerful tool to fight against infectious diseases,\" said Dr Manson Fok, Chairman of the Board of the company, Executive & Trust Committee member of Macau Henry Fok Foundation and Dean of Faculty of Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology.\nHumankind's modern day battles against epidemics remain a major challenge and it is vital that people keep learning from the past and equipping themselves with the best technologies available.

However, fast the Coronavirus is spreading, the impact is spreading faster and wider. Fear, especially combined with government travel bans, is a powerful deterrent to tourism.\u201d The Chinese authorities issued a ban on sales of all outbound travel packages on 24 January 2020 encouraging travel organizers to urge their clients to boycott travel. A total ban on group travel was instigated as of 27 January 2020. The Golden week surrounding the Chinese New Year is an important time for business during a low-season period. \u201cWe estimate that about 7% of all annual outbound tourism from China takes place during the Chinese New Year was due to leave China before the travel ban took place on the 27th of January, but the evolving situation led to approximately 60% of the groups being cancelled. So, with caution, it is possible that two-thirds of the visitors expected to arrive in Europe over this period have not done so,\u201d said Tom Jenkins. \u201cThese are last-minute cancellations \u2013 some within twenty-four hours \u2013 releasing space when there is little alternative demand\u201d added Jenkins. \u201cWe also need to stress that Europe \u2013 and the UK will continue to be viewed as part of Europe by long haul markets \u2013 remains virtually free of Coronavirus. It needs to be free of the even more contagious and damaging threat of fear,\u201d he concluded.",

TEM image of 2019-nCoV particles. Image credit: Zhu et al , doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2001017.\n\u201cThe recent emergence of 2019-nCoV puts the world on alert,\u201d said senior author Dr. Fang Li from the Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences at the University of Minnesota and colleagues.\n\u201c2019-nCoV is reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002-2003.\u201d\n\u201cOur decade-long structural studies have shown how SARS-CoV interacts with animal and human hosts in order to infect them. The mechanics of infection by 2019-nCoV appear to be similar.\u201d\nDr. Li and co-authors used the knowledge they gleaned from multiple strains of SARS-CoV \u2014 isolated from different hosts in different years \u2014 and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors from different animal species to model predictions for the new coronavirus.\nBoth viruses use ACE2 to gain entry into the cell, but it serves normally as a regulator for heart function. Left: experimentally determined structure of the interface between a designed SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) \u2014 optimized for human ACE2 recognition \u2014 and human ACE2. Right: modeled structure of the interface between 2019-nCoV RBD and human ACE2; here mutations were introduced to the RBD region in left panel based on sequence differences between SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. Image credit: Wan et al , doi: 10.1128/JVI.00127-20.\n\u201cOur structural analyses confidently predict that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its host receptor,\u201d the researchers said.\n\u201cThat and several other structural details of the new virus are consistent with the ability of the new coronavirus to infect humans and with some capability to transmit among humans.\u201d\n\u201cAlarmingly, our data predict that a single mutation \u2014 at a specific spot in the genome \u2014 could significantly enhance 2019-nCoV\u2019s ability to bind with human ACE2.\u201d\n\u201cFor this reason, 2019-nCoV evolution in patients should be closely monitored for the emergence of novel mutations at the 501 position in its genome, and to a lesser extent, the 494 position, in order to predict the possibility of a more serious outbreak than has been seen so far.\u201d\nThe findings were published in the Journal of Virology , a journal of the American Society for Microbiology.",

It was listed as one of the risk factors I outlined in Lurking Risks and it appears to now be indeed market impacting as the virus has now been reported in 16 countries and futures indication for tonight are showing risk off for the moment. Liquidity moves markets! Follow the money. Find the profits!\nFirstly let me state again that I hope this virus gets contained in short order. If it does then history suggests that any impact on markets would be temporary and soon forgotten as previous health scares were.\nNobody wants a virus to spread and cause extensive loss of life. Even if one is bearish equities and positioned as such, no reasonable person would take pleasure in seeing such an unforeseen trigger being a primary driver of a market sell-off. The bear case stands on its own, structural, technical, valuations etc. and remains a separate discussion.\nBut markets are extremely stretched and richly valued and one can never know what trigger creates a shift in sentiment.\nThe coronavirus is new and information about it is evolving daily, hourly even. Currently it appears to have a fatality rate of around 3%. While that sounds minor on the surface it really isn\u2019t as history shows.\nHumanity has lived with the common flu for as long as we can remember and it\u2019s causing thousands of fatalities each year. It\u2019s not pleasant, but is considered contained and, I hate to say, an accepted risk factor in life.\nBut the flu is no joking matter and has known to cause absolute havoc on humanity. Just a little over a hundred years ago the Spanish flu was an absolute disaster for the people at the time. It lasted for nearly 2 years and killed millions of people.\nAccording to Wikipedia: \u201cProbably 50 million, and possibly as high as 100 million (three to five percent of Earth\u2019s population at the time) died, making it one of the deadliest epidemics in human history.\u201d\nThree to five percent of the earth\u2019s population. That\u2019s a significant number and translated to today\u2019s global population a virus with similar impact would be absolutely devastating. With over 7.5 billion people on the planet now we\u2019re talking 200-500 million people in a similar scenario.\nThat\u2019s not fear mongering, it\u2019s just math, so obviously it\u2019s extremely crucial that this virus is contained and the fear of such an infectious virus explains why the Chinese government is so aggressive in restricting travel and building make shift hospitals.\nThis coronavirus at this stage has not produced anywhere near the fatalities that the common flu produces each year and hence on the surface is a non issue.\nBut this virus apparently bears a dangerous component: It transmits without a person showing symptoms:",

        "content": "I continue to monitor the ludicrous reports being thrown out there by the LIARS in the Jew spew media outlets... It is so disgusting to see those ass clowns now try to go nearly 24/7 round the clock \"reporting\" on this supposed and alleged \"epidemic\" in China, while at the same time trying to scare the living hell out of viewers with false claims that this \"epidemic\" will soon be here in North America I have already shown in the previous article about this hysteria and fraud how these criminals have been trying to sell the gullible public the lies that there are \"people falling over and dying in the streets\" from this Corona Virus, and I have another key point to bring forward in this article as well...\nI want to present the following most interesting report, that comes from Marko Marjanovic, through the Aletho News website, at www.alethonews.com, that shows that the median age of those who have supposedly died from this \"killer\" virus is 75 YEARS of age! Here in fact is that report, and I have further thoughts and comments to follow:\nThe Median Age of Wuhan Virus Fatalities Is 75 By Marko Marjanovi\u0107 | Anti-Empire | January 24, 2020 When a new disease appears a measure of concern is natural since we don\u2019t know yet what we\u2019re dealing with, but just statistically it\u2019s highly unlikely a disease, just because it is new, will be particularly deadly. On the contrary, chances are a new disease will be no more deadly or untreatable than the average existing one. We can applaud China for taking the threat seriously, just to be on the safe side, but there is no reason to fall for the media\u2019s relentless attempts to maximize your stress levels. They\u2019ll use every trick in the book to maximize your attention and earn a bigger advertiser buck. We go through this every couple of years. Mad cow disease, bird flu, SARS, ebola are just a few of the past examples. In the end, none of them ever racked up high body counts. The Wuhan virus has so far killed 26 people, all of whom were elderly or had pre-existing conditions. In fact, the median age of the first 19 victims is 75-years old. This new disease so far looks like a type of flu, quite possibly a weaker and more survivable strain. The common flu kills 300,000-600,000 people yearly, depending on the year. Likewise overwhelmingly among the elderly.\nNTS Notes: Yes, the facts are that this Corona Virus has indeed caused some deaths in Wuhan, China.. But what is NOT being told is that the vast majority of the victims of this \"deadly disease\" have already been suffering from ailments that weaken their immune system!\nAnd the facts are that the majority of those who have fallen victim to this \"epidemic\" are the elderly, and according to the list most probably again have failing immune systems and are already suffering from other diseases and respiratory illnesses It therefore shows that those who are much younger and stronger may also contract this disease, but due to their stronger immune systems are more readily able to fight off the disease....\nReaders, what we have here is further proof that all of this fear mongering from those who are trying to sell the notion that this is an \"epidemic\" in the making is nothing but bull crap, and the proponents of that stupidity are full of shit\nI will say that it is sad that there are indeed victims of this virus.... But for the Jew spew media to try to sell the notion that this is an \"epidemic in the making\" and that everyone could be infected and possibly die is not only hysteria, but absolutely abominable! But again, they have their marching orders, and the agenda behind this propaganda is obvious in trying to get everyone to line up and get their \"vaccine\" for this \"disease\" the moment it becomes available.... Do not be fooled, everyone..",

        "content": "Mechelen, Belgium, 23 April 2020 - Biocartis Group NV (the 'Company' or 'Biocartis'), an innovative molecular diagnostics company (Euronext Brussels: BCART), today announces the development of a SARS-CoV-2 test, the virus that causes COVID-19, on the fully automated, rapid and easy to use molecular diagnostics platform Idylla\u2122. Upon regulatory approval, the Idylla\u2122 SARS-CoV-2 test is targeted to help healthcare providers manage the COVID-19 pandemic through rapid and easy testing of individuals with flu-like symptoms. In addition, the Idylla\u2122 SARS-CoV-2 test may be used in combination with the recently CE-marked IVD SeptiCyte \u00ae RAPID Test 1 on Idylla\u2122 to facilitate the management of patients within the hospital intensive care unit (ICU). When used together, this combined testing solution on Idylla\u2122 has the unique potential to identify patients with severe disease, as recent data 2 indicate that sepsis is the most frequently observed complication in COVID-19 3 . Biocartis develops the Idylla\u2122 SARS-CoV-2 test with support from multiple undisclosed partners as part of a joint commitment to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Idylla\u2122 SARS-CoV-2 test will be based on the Idylla\u2122 Respiratory (IFV-RSV) Panel 4 that received 510(k) clearance by the US FDA on 5 September 2017 and is being designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory samples such as nasopharyngeal swabs. Subject to a successful 'Emergency Use Authorization' by the US FDA, launch of the Idylla\u2122 SARS-CoV-2 test is expected in the second half of 2020 5 . The US FDA 510(k) clearance of the SeptiCyte \u00ae RAPID Test on Idylla\u2122 is expected along the same timelines.\nThe SeptiCyte \u00ae RAPID Test (CE-IVD) on Idylla\u2122 is a rapid host-response 6 test, developed in collaboration with Immunexpress Pty Ltd ('Immunexpress' ) , that distinguishes sepsis from non-infectious SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) and provides actionable results in about one hour 7 . On 26 March 2020 , Biocartis announced that it would lead the commercialization of this test in Europe as the exclusive distributor, while Immunexpress will lead commercialization in the US.\nHerman Verrelst, Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis, commented : \" Developing a respiratory panel device detecting SARS-CoV-2 on Idylla\u2122, especially when used in unique combination together with the Septicyte \u00ae RAPID Test on Idylla\u2122, is expected to address the significant current and longer term unmet needs in hospitals and specifically in ICU's to more efficiently triage patients with flu-like symptoms. As such, unnecessary ICU admissions could potentially be prevented or average length of hospital stays could be reduced.\"",

The spies were removed from the facility and returned to China, where the pathogen was studied at the Chinese Level 4 facility in WUHAN, a few miles from the wet market taking the blame for the onset of this dangerous viral outbreak. https://www.jerrywdavis.com/wp-content/uploads/Wuhan.Writhing.mp4 You can read more on the theft and expulsion here: https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/did-china-steal-coronavirus-canada-and-weaponize-it There is no treatment for this pathogen, and the only defense is your immune system. I will publish my own plans for preparing my family to successfully resist infection in a few days. I suggest you watch the 1995 movie \u201cOUTBREAK\u201d to get an idea of what potentially can play out on a global scale. Yes, a global scale. This Is How China Is Hiding The True Number Of Coronavirus Deaths\nAs the world\u2019s cortisol and stomach acid levels rise every hour in parallel with the number of officially reported Coronavirus infections (and deaths), which as of Saturday morning was roughly 1,400\u2026 Source: Johns Hopkins GIS and Data.\n\u2026 the world has an unpleasant flashback to 2003 when for weeks Beijing would lie and hide the full extent of the SARS epidemic to avoid risking a social panic. To be sure, this time China has done its best to pretend it has learned from the past and it is so transparent, even President Xi Jinping warned that the country is facing a \u201cgrave situation\u201d, and that the spread of the deadly virus is accelerating after holding a special government meeting on the Lunar New Year public holiday.\nAfter staying largely silent in public about the outbreak since it first emerged in central China last month, Xi on Saturday convened a special meeting of the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, calling for a more centralized response to the epidemic and asserting personal responsibility in addressing the crisis.\n\u201cWhen an epidemic breaks out, a command is issued. It is our responsibility to prevent and control it,\u201d Xi said, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency. He called for the new high-level committee to \u201caddress concerns within and outside the country,\u201d indirectly referencing mounting global concern about the epidemic, which Mr. Xi described as a \u201cgrave situation\u201d that was accelerating. \u201cWe definitely can win the battle to contain the epidemic,\u201d he vowed.\nThat remains to be seen: as reported earlier , in China \u2013 which has put over 56 million people on lockdown quarantine \u2013 the coronavirus has killed at least 41 people and infected over 1,400 in China. Ominously, a UK researcher predicted that the Coronavirus would infect over 250,000 people in China in under two weeks, which has sparked a renewed fear that China will once again try to under-represent the true severity of the diseases until it is too late. A patient at the Zhongnan Hospital of China\u2019s Wuhan University\nThe problem is that even as China theatrically pretends to be so forthright about the extent of the epidemic \u2013 if only to avoid panic and chaos over allegations it is again hiding the full impact of the disease \u2013 it is doing precisely that , and now we know just how it is doing that : instead of putting down coronavirus as the cause of death for an unknown number of Wuhan casualties, China\u2019s coroners and hospitals merely ascribe death to \u201cviral pneumonia\u201d, case closed.\nHere\u2019s how the WSJ describes this treacherous \u201cbait and switch\u201d:\nA 53-year-old fitness trainer died on Wednesday after checking into a hospital in Wuhan a little more than a week earlier, said his niece. His family had expected the death certificate to reflect the deadly coronavirus, because as his condition deteriorated, his doctors told his family he was suffering from an untreatable virus in his lungs.\nInstead, it recorded \u201csevere pneumonia\u201d as the cause of death, she said. The relatives of two other people who died in separate hospitals in Wuhan this week also described similar situations, saying the causes of death had been given as \u201cviral pneumonia.\u201d\nWhy did the hospital do this? Because as the relatives of all three now dead people said, the deceased hadn\u2019t been included in China\u2019s official count of 41 deaths attributed to coronavirus .\nAnd that\u2019s how China is suppressing the full extent of nCoV\u2019s lethality, and keeping the mortality rate of the coronavirus artificially low: \u201cThere are likely to be many times more cases in Wuhan than officially confirmed,\u201d said Neil Ferguson, a disease modeler at Imperial College London, who echoed the forecast of Jonathan Read , and estimated as many as 4,000 people may have been infected in Wuhan. \u201cClearly, the hospitals are overwhelmed.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s worse is that if there are indeed 4,000 injected already , then the previously discussed catastrophic forecast of 250,000 cases by Feb 4 may be overly optimistic by half.\nThe official numbers are far lower of course: on Saturday morning, local time, the number of confirmed global infections had risen to at least 1,438, nearly doubling from the previous day. Comically, China has said it would hold officials accountable for any delays or omissions in reporting cases: so far such threats appear to have had precisely zero impact on anyone.\nOthers have confirmed as much: as the WSJ reports, \u201c some Chinese media with reporters on the ground in Wuhan have said they have found cases that weren\u2019t included in the official reporting. Caixin, a business journal, reported in early January that a doctor in Wuhan had been infected, 11 days before officials confirmed that medical staff had been infected. The Beijing News, a newspaper, reported this week that many patients weren\u2019t officially labeled as carrying the new virus, even though their doctors and nurses said they were.\u201d Medical staff work to sterilize a hospital in Wuhan, China, on Jan. 24\nThat said, there may be a legitimate reason why the real number is being underreported, and it has to do with the flood of actual cases which is just too much for local doctors to keep up: China state-run TV cited doctors in Wuhan who said the number of patients with fever was too many to be treated and patients hospitalized couldn\u2019t get the pathogenic test in time, because the samples needed to be sent to the provincial offices of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThat will soon change: China\u2019s health ministry updated its protocol for identifying infections on Thursday with a simplified process for registering cases as suspected or confirmed. An earlier version, viewed by the Journal, required several steps of testing before a patient could be called a suspected case.\nYet despite these mitigating circumstances, it appears that the underlying incentive is to underreport the true extent of the epidemic for as long as possible.\nOne woman, a 63-year-old retiree in Wuhan, died on Tuesday, her nephew told the WSJ. The death certificate, viewed by the Journal, shows the cause of death as \u201cpneumonia obtained from the community.\u201d Doctors at the hospital that treated her told the family she had the new coronavirus, the nephew said, but she wasn\u2019t counted as a case. The instance has also been reported by the Beijing News.\nIn another case, a 72-year-old former doctor was in the hospital for three days before he died on Tuesday, his nephew said. The doctors told the family he had caught viral pneumonia, he said. The niece said her uncle, the fitness trainer, first noticed symptoms of what he thought was a common cold in early January, which he believed he had caught at a banquet. He didn\u2019t pay much attention initially, but a few days later, he decided to go to the hospital after seeing blood when he coughed. His niece said he had never been to the food market believed to be the epicenter of the virus.\n\u201cThe doctor told us repeatedly that he caught the viral pneumonia that no medicine could treat,\u201d she said. A patient\u2019s immune system is the only defense, she said the family was told. \u201cBut after he died, the death certificate only said \u2018severe pneumonia, \u2019\u201d she said, adding that she had expected the record to reflect the newly detected coronavirus.\nThe uncle was transferred to the infectious diseases unit on Wednesday, the niece said. Hours later, the family was informed that his condition was critical. Two days after her uncle died, China\u2019s health ministry released the profiles of 39 deaths in Hubei due to the new virus, with two deaths listed in other provinces. She couldn\u2019t find her uncle on the list.\nAs hundreds if not thousands of Wuhan residents die due to \u201csevere pneumonia\u201d instead of coronavirus, one can\u2019t help but wonder if once the true cause of death is reported, instead of a 4% mortality rate as calculated by Dr. Jonathan Read, the Coronavirus epidemic will be in double digits \u2013 SARS was 11% \u2013 making this one of the most deadly epidemics in history.\nIncidentally, here is a reminder of what happened when China\u2019s attempts to cover up the full extent of the 2003 SARS epidemic were exposed:\nA Chinese doctor who exposed the cover-up of China\u2019s SARS outbreak in 2003 has been barred from traveling to the United States to collect a human rights award, a friend of the doctor and a human rights group said this week.\nThe doctor, Jiang Yanyong, a retired surgeon in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, was awarded the Heinz R. Pagels Human Rights of Scientists Award by the New York Academy of Sciences. His army-affiliated work unit, Beijing\u2019s Hospital 301, denied him permission to travel to the award ceremony in September, Hu Jia, a Chinese rights promoter who is a friend of Dr. Jiang\u2019s, said Thursday.\nDr. Jiang rose to international prominence in 2003, when he disclosed in a letter circulated to international news organizations that at least 100 people were being treated in Beijing hospitals for severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. At the time, the Chinese medical authorities were asserting that the entire nation had only a handful of cases of the disease.\nThe revelation prompted China\u2019s top leaders to acknowledge that they had provided false information about the epidemic. The health minister and the mayor of Beijing were removed from their posts.\nSurely this time is different. ",

        "content": "While many religious communities have embraced physical distancing measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, some still encourage gatherings despite strong public health messages that large groups run a significant threat of disease transmission.\nSome ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in New York continue to gather for funerals, weeks after physical distancing guidelines went into effect in the city.\nFour Brooklyn neighborhoods with large Orthodox Jewish populations have especially high rates of coronavirus infection, according to data released in early April.\nOther religious leaders are using the pulpit to spread misinformation. The evangelical pastor Kenneth Copeland, for example, claims to have cures for Covid-19. And some Hindu nationalists in India have blamed Muslims for the country\u2019s outbreak, leading to a surge in hate crimes.\nAs these situations demonstrate, millions of people worldwide look more to religious authorities than health officials for guidance on how to behave and what to believe in a crisis.\nMy research on the intersections between public health and religion suggests enlisting religious institutions worldwide will be vital in stopping the spread of coronavirus.\nConnecting theology and health Social resistance to medical intervention often drives the transmission of infectious diseases, research shows.\nStudying the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which killed over 11,000 people between 2014 and 2016, I have identified important lessons\u2014both positive and negative\u2014about how religious actors can help build essential bridges between faith and science to strengthen a pandemic response.\nBridging theology and science was imperative in the Ebola outbreak, when up to 60 percent of Ebola cases were linked to funerals.\nTraditional religious burials in West Africa, both Christian and Muslim, often involve touching and washing the body, yet contact with body fluids spread Ebola.\nFor the first months of the outbreak, in early 2014, government prescriptions to cremate or swiftly bury the dead sparked fears and suspicion in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea\u2014the most affected countries.\nMany relief workers, outsiders dressed in spacesuit-like protective outfits sent in to implement these procedures in Ebola-affected communities, were blocked from entering.\nOthers faced violent, even deadly, physical attacks.\nIn late 2014, public health officials and religious leaders got together with the World Health Organization to produce a protocol for culturally sensitive burials of Ebola victims. Over 2,000 Christian and Muslim leaders were trained to conduct safe, dignified funerals in Liberia and Sierra Leone.\nThe burial protocol may have saved thousands of lives, according to a 2017 study published in the journal of Neglected Tropical Diseases.\nFaith and trust Among the assets that religious actors offer is trust\u2014perhaps the most vital key in a crisis for addressing fear and misinformation.\nAfter an initial period of doubt and confusion, when many faith leaders in West Africa understood Ebola as divine punishment for various sins or simply as fate, public health officials made a concerted effort to get religious leaders to the same tables as scientists to educate and engage them on health education.\nBy late 2014, faith-inspired organizations like World Vision International were organizing workshops that taught public health practices like meticulous hygiene and quarantining of people exposed to Ebola grounded in theology and scripture.\nLike the burial protocol, such programs proved to be a crucial step in halting the spread of Ebola.\nAn equivalent intervention for Covid-19 might be a simple message focused on physical distancing, for example\u2014framed by religious leaders in terms people can understand and accept.\nBuilding bridges Any Covid-19 prevention program aimed at religious communities would have to work with faith-based organizations that know local leaders and have roots in the community.\nBut it is difficult to build partnerships between faith and health networks not accustomed to working together.\nThe Ebola outbreak demonstrated that relationships between religious and health institutions in West Africa were at best patchy.\nGovernments, international health agencies and aid groups lacked systematic knowledge about the region\u2019s diverse religious landscape, which includes Christianity, Islam and traditional African religions. And little relevant public information was available to help them learn the ropes.\nUltimately, groups of religious leaders from various faith traditions worked through interreligious councils to help coordinate national faith responses.\nOn the regional level, faith-inspired organizations like World Vision, Catholic Relief Services and the Tony Blair Faith Foundation leveraged their relationships with religious actors in West Africa to provide funding, supplies and training for Ebola relief workers.\nThe global scale of the will make it even more challenging to launch faith-inspired public health programs today.\nI am part of one such effort to begin this difficult, delicate process. On March 11, the World Faiths Development Dialogue and Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs at Georgetown University, where I teach, joined with the Joint Learning Initiative on Faith and Local Communities to document how faith communities are responding to Covid-19.\nMy project includes a digital repository to track changes to religious gatherings, beliefs and practices during the pandemic. So far, the database shows that religious communities are responding in very different ways.\nMany Christian, Muslim and Jewish communities in the US are providing financial as well as spiritual support for not only the ill but also those who\u2019ve lost jobs because the outbreak. Global faith-based groups like Religions for Peace are teaming up to provide support for vulnerable children worldwide.\nBut other religious groups continue to spread false information to explain the disease.\nHope for the future For health officials, figuring out which religious leaders worldwide to work with, who their constituents are and how to transmit health messages that will resonate with these communities will be tricky indeed.\nBut once on board, faith leaders can do more than convey health guidance: They can bring messages of hope to communities struggling with anxiety, sadness and despair.\nOn March 27 Pope Francis, speaking alone from the Vatican to a plaza usually filled with followers, urged Catholics to approach the pandemic through faith, not fear.\n\u201cEmbracing the Lord in order to embrace hope,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the strength of faith, which frees us from fear.\u201d Katherine Marshall/The Conversation",

The current plant vacation to celebrate the New Year will be extended by one week until February 9 in all three BMW Group plants in China. Whether the vacation will be further extended it depends on the developments over the next few days.\nA total of around 18,000 people are employed in the three BMW plants around Shenyang. It goes without saying that the BMW Group takes all measures to prevent the spread of the corona virus \u2013 even if a week of production downtime is associated with considerable costs, after all, a high four-digit number of new cars will be built less than planned.\nFurthermore, all employees with office workstations are required to do their work from home.

The average American female is 30 pounds lighter.\nUsain Bolt holds the world record (men) for the 100 meters at 9.58 seconds. The very feminine Florence Griffith Joyner or FloJo holds the women's record at 10.49 seconds.\nFlorence G Joyner 1959 -1998\nBut those are physical aspects.\nI ntellectually men and women are not equal either. A ll over the world women seem to achieve higher levels of education than men. And statistics do show that women have (on average) slightly higher IQ than men. This is a late 20th century phenomenon and is increasing all over the world.\nIn modern manufacturing female workers can outproduce male workers. The same applies in modern agriculture.\nMales outperform females in heavy manufacturing and heavy labour like construction. Males are still better at lifting 50 kg bags of cement all day.\nThe world is constantly changing, and for a very large part it is changing for the better.\nThe right word to use is modernising.\nEtymology of 'modern' - From Middle French moderne, from Late Latin modernus; from Latin modo (\u201cjust now\u201d), originally modus (\u201cmeasure\u201d); hence, by measure, \"just now\".\nModern relates to measuring the uptodate status of something.\nSo it is very appropriate to ask questions like :\nIs this the latest technology? Is this the latest version of this engine? Is this the newest design? Is this the most effective method? Is this the most uptodate software? Is this the latest surgical method ?\nThese are everyday questions which everyone asks. Why do we ask this everyday question? Because as human beings we need to reassure ourselves that our species the human beings are progressing. That our lives are improving today compared to yesterday. And that tomorrow will see more improvement than today. So we really want to constantly modernise. That is the key to our success as the human species.\nSo with reference to today, anything that does not provide scope for 'modernising' has to be Stone Age. Jahiliyah or ignorant.\nCulture, traditions (including superstitions) and religion are not modern.\nThey seek to preserve the old (traditional Japanese sword making). Or they seek to be stuck in a rut (religion).\nHence traditional swordmaking and swords have no practical use to human beings. Other than displaying them on a wall or for recreational use (in a dozo).\nWhat about religion ? Religion is the opposite of modern. There is no such thing as the latest, the newest or uptodate in religion. Religion is as uptodate as its age. If a religion is 5000 years old, then its adherents are dinosaurs. If a religion is 1000 years old then its adherents are dinosaurs.\nThere is no progression (modernisation) beyond the age of that religion.\nThat is why you see the type of arguments to justify forcing under aged girls to marry their 'rapists' or 'partners' in places like Turkey, North Africa and the Middle East.\nThese regions still suffer an overdose of religion and old traditions. Which means they are not modern. Without modernisation they have to be backward. There is no compromise between the two.\nOf course I am talking about organised religion only. Of course I consider myself a thoroughly modern human being. Of course I must believe in an orderly way of life.\n",

        "content": "Thousands of movie theaters in China have closed their doors this weekend due to the coronavirus outbreak. The virus originated in the city of Wuhan in China\u2019s Hubei province. However, it\u2019s since spread to other countries, including the United States. Dozens of people have already died from the outbreak in China, with nearly 2,000 more infected. This has caused Chinese officials to take precautions to do what they can to stop the coronavirus from spreading further.\nOne unintended side effect of the outbreak has been an increased interest in plagues in general. This led the popular mobile game Plague Inc. to see an increase in sales in China. The game\u2019s developer, Ndemic Creations, released a statement as a result. The company explained, \u201c whenever there is an outbreak of disease we see an increase in players, as people seek to find out more about how diseases spread and to understand the complexities of viral outbreaks .\u201d The Plague Inc. developer went on to caution, \u201c Plague Inc. is a game, not a scientific model and the current coronavirus outbreak is a very real situation which is impacting a huge number of people.\u201d\nAccording to Variety , the theater closures in China began over the weekend. They affected 70,000 screens and at least six different theater chains. What\u2019s more, the news comes during the weekend of the Chinese New Year, when audiences flock to the movies, similar to what happens Thanksgiving weekend in the United States. China usually generates at least $1 billion at the box office during the week of the Chinese New Year. Additionally, seven blockbuster films that were scheduled for a release date of January 25 were canceled prior to the theater closure announcement.\nMovie theaters aren\u2019t the only thing closing due to the coronavirus outbreak: Disneyland in Shanghai has been affected as well. The park closed earlier this weekend, explaining the shut down was \u201c in response to the prevention and control of the disease outbreak .\u201d At the time, no information about when the park might again be available to guests was given. However, it\u2019s likely a large loss for Disneyland in Shanghai, as, like with the movies, families often head to the park during the Chinese New Year celebrations.\nThough moviegoers in China are probably disappointed they couldn\u2019t make it to theaters this weekend, the outbreak is clearly a situation where safety has to come first. Though, with so many new releases delayed due to the virus, at least families who typically celebrate the Chinese New Year with a trip to the theater didn\u2019t miss too much. It\u2019s unknown when cinema operations will resume, but at least when they do theater audiences will know every precaution was taken Facebook ",

        "content": "Earlier today, Rabobank\u2019s Michael Every laid out succinctly the dilemma facing Beijing, when he said that \u201cChina appears to have perhaps decided that the economic damage being wrought by a demand collapse and supply-chain shutdown is just too much to bear.\u201d As reported overnight, Xi Jinping stated that China will meet its economic goals AND win the battle vs. the virus, and Beijing is urging firms to increase output even as the capital itself is largely locked down \u2013 and other cities are physically locking people into their homes. That\u2019s as even the US admits that the Phase One trade deal will be slow off the market due to the virus impact.\nOf course, China is no stranger to Double Think: as Every put it, \u201ca freely-floating, controlled currency; market-determined, state-directed interest rates; and free-trade mercantilism. Yet increase economic activity from here and the virus will spread, both internally and globally. Concentrate on just the virus, and the local and global economic impact will be enormous.\u201d\nThat, in a nutshell, was how Rabobank saw China\u2019s \u201cdialectic that has no comfortable Fichtean synthesis to the thesis and antithesis\u201d and concluded that \u201cthings are going to get nasty for economies and markets \u2013 especially with official WHO word that a vaccine is 18-months away.\u201d\nToday, two days after China officially returned to work, we got the first confirmation of just how catastrophic Beijing\u2019s order to local enterprises and businesses to rush back reboot the economy could be, when Jennifer Zeng reported that a company in Suzhou reopened, and immediately at least one CoVid2019 case found. As a result, the company\u2019s 200+ employees couldn\u2019t go home and were immediately placed under quarantine . At least the workers managed to \u201corganize\u201d quilts for themselves. Company in #Suzhou reopened. One #CoVid2019 case found. Over 200 employed couldn't go home and immediately under quarantine. They managed to organize quilts for themselves.\nThis is just the first such case. Expect many more \u2013 especially across Hubei and its neighboring provinces \u2013 as latent cases of Coronavirus which were never caught and cured spark new infections and mini epidemics, all of which dutifully captured on a smartphone clip for everyone in China to watch and freak out even more.\nWhich reminds us of another comment from Rabobank, which last week explained why the dilemma facing China is \u201ctruly awful\u201d:\nThe quandary for China between releasing the quarantine straitjacket in days to stop its economy from getting truly sick, and allowing a virus like this to spread further as people start to mingle again is truly awful. There are no good options. For a world with a serious lack of final end-demand, and which has been relying on China, along with increasingly \u201cChinese\u201d central banks, this is going to be a nasty shock either way that Mr Market is treating like he is Mr Magoo.\nAnd since Beijing has no way out, especially since the epidemic is still raging despite Beijing\u2019s \u201cdoctored\u201d, no pun intended, infection and death numbers, expect China to unleash the most draconian censorship crackdown on any reports Covid-2019 has not only not been purged but is making unwelcome appearances across China\u2019s enterprises, which will be quietly put under blanket quarantine even as Beijing pretends that all is well and its economy is once again humming on all cylinders until eventually the epidemic reaches a critical mass and China has no choice but to once again admit the full extent of the social and economic fallout. And just like in the case of SARS, don\u2019t expect such \u201chonesty\u201d to emerge for at least several weeks if not months.",

The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) will also step up precautionary measures in all preschools as follows. These measures will also apply to specific social services for vulnerable groups e.g. residential facilities, disability day activity centres. Large group and communal activities such as assemblies, excursions, field trips and mass celebrations will be suspended Health checks and temperature screening for all children, staff and visitors will continue. The frequency of temperature taking for children and staff will be increased.\nFor more information, visit here .\n1. As of 4 February 2020 2pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed six additional cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in Singapore. Four of these cases involve human-to-human transmission in Singapore. Eighteen confirmed cases were earlier announced by MOH.\n2. Three of the local transmission cases can be traced to contact with recent travellers from Mainland China. The fourth case is a close contact of one of the local transmission cases. The remaining two were from among the group of Singaporeans who were evacuated from Wuhan on 30 January.\n3. Though four of these cases constitute a local transmission cluster, there is as yet no evidence of widespread sustained community transmission in Singapore.\nWearing of masks is recommended only if one is not feeling well. Good to have some masks as standby but please do not hoard or it will lead to a shortage in the market, not just locally but worldwide. Those who really need it, eg patients and healthcare workers, will suffer.\nThe Government has just announced a one-off measure to distribute over 5.2 million masks to 1.37 million local households amidst concern over the Wuhan coronavirus. Each household, both in public and private housing estates will be eligible for 4 masks per household. The masks are free.\nEvery household in Singapore to get 4 masks; collection starts on Feb 1, for more information, visit here .\nYou can check where to collect your mask by entering your postal code here maskgowhere.sg\nPlaces to get updates on Wuhan Virus (2019-nCoV) Singapore:",

Jobzella Email A state of worry controls agents and dealers of cars imported from China after the spread of the Corona virus from Wuhan, China, which resulted in the suspension of many businesses inside the country. International car companies decided to withdraw their employees from their factories operating in China or banned travel to the country due to the rapid spread of the disease. Khaled Saad, Director General of Brilliance Bavarian and Secretary General of the Automobile Manufacturers Association, ruled out the appearance of any negative repercussions resulting from the suspension of activities in some commercial and industrial sectors in China after the outbreak of the Corona virus. He pointed out that various Chinese auto companies possess stocks in Egypt that allow them to follow-up and continue their marketing activities, saying that the negative impact on the car market will appear if the virus continues to negatively affect China. He added that the companies auto stocks are sufficient for the expected sales for a period of two to six months. Brilliance has enough cars for a period of three months. He pointed out that the agent imports cars according to the size of local demand, not according to a monthly quota, as they are required to achieve specific annual targets determined by the parent company. Saad ruled out the presence of any obstacles that might hinder the entry of Chinese industrial products shipped from customs outlets, as medical checks and health security measures are carried out on agricultural products that are likely to be carriers of the virus. He pointed to the intensity of the car market\u2019s competition with European and Turkish products which are exempted from customs. He also excluded the chance that Chinese companies would resort to increasing car prices in the coming period due to the inability of the local market to accommodate the rise in car prices with weak purchasing power, in addition to the fact that the rise in car prices will negatively affect sales of Chinese models which could completely stop after price increases. Abdel-Moneim El-Kady, vice head of the Engineering Industries Chamber of the Federation of Industries, said that feeder industries are considering the effects resulting from activity cessation in China after the Corona virus outbreak, especially since feeding industries import many raw materials from China, and auto factories are negatively affected by the possibility of stopping the supply of these raw materials. He added that the factories of the feeder industries have a strategy for the quantities of raw materials, studied in advance and planned in terms of in-store units, in addition to the shipments and quantities that are opened for approval. This cycle depends on the production quantities, which are closely related to the size of the local demand. He denied the fact that there are obstacles hindering the products shipped from China. He pointed out that the feeder industries factories deal with companies in the industrial city of Kwangju, which is far from the city where the virus is spreading.",

Corona is known as one of the best beers in the world and has been propagated widely through movies like \u2018Fast and Furious\u2019. Talking about these factors favouring Corona, Digital Expert Karthik Srinivasan said, \u201cCorona is a much older and established brand, while the disease is new. There\u2019s a deep association set already with the Corona brand name, and I really don\u2019t think it would affect them.\u201d\nWe\u2019ve often seen competitors take on each other while one is down. When Maggi was accused of containing lead above the permissible limit, other players like Yippee had upped their advertising and marketing game to create some \u201cYippee converts\u201d. Will we see something similar in the beer game? Players like Carlsberg, Budweiser and Heineken might enjoy the idea of taking down a competitor. What should be understood though is that nobody would want to get their hands dirty and propagate over such a deadly virus. Maybe doing the opposite \u2013 helping people understand the difference \u2013 can create a good market image, similar to the Burger King and McDonald\u2019s creatives. Probably that can take them a long way ahead, at least in the eyes of the people. Adding to this, Srinivasan said, \u201cI really don\u2019t think Corona\u2019s rivals may try to use this in any way. It\u2019s just terribly poor form to take advantage of a rival\u2019s misfortune, particularly on the back of a deadly disease like this.\u201d\nIt\u2019s just disturbing to see how confused people are in the midst of the spread of a deadly virus having the potential of spreading globally. The Coronavirus has hit China at the time of the Chinese New Year, which means people have travelled across the globe before the government finally started detaining and isolating people to curb the virus\u2019 spread. Digital platforms need to be used as a space to spread the right information, especially during the times of a deadly outbreak.\nLeave Corona alone, enjoy the beer, and stay safe from the #CoronaVirus.",

Copyright: Institut Pasteur Press release | Share\nOn January 24, 2020, the French Ministry of Health confirmed the first three cases of patients affected by the Wuhan coronavirus. On January 29, 2020, the Institut Pasteur, which is responsible for monitoring respiratory viruses in France, sequenced the whole genome of the coronavirus known as \"2019-nCoV\", becoming the first institution in Europe to sequence the virus since the start of the outbreak. The virus was sequenced at the Institut Pasteur's Mutualized Platform for Microbiology (P2M), which performs genome sequencing on bacterial, viral, fungal and parasite strains received by National Reference Centers and World Health Organization Collaborating Centers for the purpose of infectious disease surveillance.\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of apparently viral pneumonia of unknown etiology emerged in the city of Wuhan, in the Chinese province of Hubei.\nOn January 9, 2020, the Chinese health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the discovery of a novel coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, which was confirmed as the agent responsible for the pneumonia cases (see the Institut Pasteur's fact sheet on the \"Wuhan coronavirus\" - page in French ).\nOver the weekend of January 11-12, the Chinese authorities shared the full sequence of the coronavirus genome, as detected in samples taken from the first patients. \"Sequencing the genome of pathogens is crucial for the development of specific diagnostic tests and the identification of potential treatment options,\" explains Sylvie van der Werf, Director of the National Reference Center (CNR) for Respiratory Viruses at the Institut Pasteur.\nFriday January 24, 2020. Detection of the virus confirmed in France\nOn Friday January 24, late in the morning, the Institut Pasteur received samples of three suspected cases (two patients in Paris and one in Bordeaux). \"Using the samples taken from these patients, we detected the novel coronavirus,\" says Sylvie Behillil, Deputy Director of the CNR at the Institut Pasteur.\nFrom Friday January 24, 2020. Viral genome sequenced at the Institut Pasteur\nThat same Friday evening, scientists launched the process of sequencing the viral genome based on the samples. The CNR prepared the material for sequencing, ready for P2M to begin work immediately the following Monday. The sequencing run was completed by early evening on the Tuesday, and the scientists used data analysis to obtain the sequence of the whole genome in two of the first three confirmed cases in France. \"This proves the efficacy of the CNR's process of analysis based on viral sequencing,\" continues Vincent Enouf.\nThursday January 30, 2020. The Institut Pasteur obtains and shares the whole sequence of the virus\nThe P2M platform (see inset below) currently performs at an extremely high level; the average time taken to produce sequences ranges from three days (for emergencies) to a maximum of ten days. In this case, it took just three days for the whole sequence to be determined: \"We performed data analysis during the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, then corroborated the results on Wednesday with counter analysis,\" explains Vincent Enouf. \"The whole sequence was confirmed in just three days.\" Whole genome sequence of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, in one of the first French cases, made at the Institut Pasteur (Paris), using a unique Platform (P2M), open to all French National Reference Centers. Copyright: Institut Pasteur / CNR of respiratory infection viruses.\nA close up on the 2019-nCoV sequence, performed at the Institut Pasteur (Paris). We see the bases in viral RNA. Copyright: Institut Pasteur / CNR of respiratory infection viruses.\nWhat can we learn from it? \"The sequences were identical in all our samples. One member of the couple must have contaminated the other, as the virus is the same.\" The two full sequences of the virus isolated in two of the first French cases were submitted to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) platform, 1 which was initially developed to share sequences and monitor the genetic evolution of influenza viruses, a process that is vital to determine the composition of the influenza vaccine. A special \"coronavirus\" tab has been created so that the scientific community can work together and advance at a quicker pace.\n\"Around twenty other sequences of the novel coronavirus genome have been obtained worldwide, and if we compare them with ours, we can see that they are all very close; there is not much diversity in the viruses analyzed, which suggests that coronavirus 2019-nCoV did not need to mutate in order to adapt and spread,\" continues Vincent Enouf.\nThe National Reference Center (CNR) for Respiratory Viruses at the Institut Pasteur in Paris is one of WHO's reference laboratories for coronavirus 2019-nCoV.\nA total of eight people from the CNR and two from the P2M sequencing platform have been working on the virus this week and will continue to monitor the outbreak in France.\nP2M, a state-of-the-art mutualized platform for microbiology also open to external CNRs\nP2M is also available to external CNRs for sequencing. In 2019 it worked with four CNRs based outside the Institut Pasteur. The platform sequences bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi. Thanks to experience gained over the past five years (since 2015), P2M today offers a highly efficient service, as shown by a first-pass success rate (i.e. a high-quality sequence providing comprehensive information on the entire genome) of more than 95% in 2019. Sequence production takes between three days (for emergencies) and ten days at most.\nIn 2019, P2M sequenced around 25,000 pathogens. Genome sequencing increases the sensitivity threshold for outbreak detection. Early identification of outbreaks by the Institut Pasteur\u2019s scientists (clustered cases in a short space of time caused by the same pathogen) enables epidemiologists to get to work immediately to determine the origins of the outbreak, and the authorities to coordinate the public health response.",

Author Dr. Jon Thomason shares research from the Moffitt Cancer Center, which pioneered research into this application of ultrasound, and he explains both how ultrasound works and how, more importantly, it can be used to as a treatment for cancer. Chemotherapy and surgery are not the only options for patients suffering from cancer. Ultrasound is a promising new alternative that could offer a noninvasive treatment without the debilitating side-effects of radiation and surgery.

Cancer uses the same viral type division.2002 3 medical professors at the Moffitt cancer centre, published the single application of High Intensity UltraSound external to the cancer, there totally clearing the council cell type from the body and brain.The a HIUS sets off molecular nuclear fusion, in the pressurised viral cells. Regular body cells are unaffected by HIUS until we reach 180 W 40 kHz. 1H2O+P+HIUS->He+O+E2+X-rayMy PH D supervisor at Sheffield University, told me that ultrasound applied to liquid water, caused nearly instantaneous boiling of the water! And formation of microw bubbles. Which transpired to be helium and oxygen bubbles. 2H2O+US->He2++O++3e-+E2+X-rayI started working on this idea, I went off for the weekend to my girlfriend who lived in Bury 180 miles away. I had written a paper on the Internet, two years in high power ultrasound might be useful treatment for cancer.Sheffield thought they were releasing me to do a medical Ph.D. at Cambridge. Cambridge University never offered!2002 the Moffitt cancer centre published the use a one session of HIUS to totally clear prostate cancer. E.g.8W 1MHz ultrasound for 1 minute. 1\" above a man's penis totally clears prostate cancer. Image result for location of prostate gland in human bodywww.pcf.org The prostate is a walnut-sized gland located between the bladder and the penis. The prostate is just in front of the rectum. The urethra runs through the center of the prostate, from the bladder to the penis, letting urine flow out of the body. The prostate secretes fluid that nourishes and protects sperm.8 Aug 2018No Dr. or drugs required. HIUS was covered in all medical magazines, included Nature Immunology. Polly Celine Eveline Matzinger is an immunologist who proposed the danger model theory of ... The nickname was given to the lab by her colleagues when Matzinger first arrived at the NIH because she spent ... In a 2013 article in Nature Immunology, Matzinger makes a case for what she now views as the most important ...I first got interested in the area of making danger cancer cell types blopgger dangerous to body, through the work of Polly Matzinger. HIUS makes viral and cancer cells boil and pop, and look dangerous to the immune system and! That then makes an clears the dangerous cell type throughout the body and brain.A suitable HIUS device costs under 20 UK pounds. And applied externally to where it hurts, will clear all types of cancer. All 200 varieties.I wrote this idea up 2008 and in 2012 I heard from a guy who was HIV+ in New York. He bought and used his own HIUS device. The next week his GP discharged him from all AIDs medicine.So from 2012 no drug company was allowed to manufacture and sell AIDs medication. So amino acid blockers, and less effective anti retroviral treatments both criminal medicine since before they were applied to AIDs.No registered Dr. has been legally allowed to prescribe any eight medication for eight years. Or the same day are struck off for life! Subsequent medical practice all medical malpractice.The manufacturing drug company is also are totally removed from medicine. Although drug patents void. The law firms that have defended the biochemical patents for last eight years, struck off the legal register!All nurses who have assisted or cancer drug delivery for last 18 years, struck off the nurses medical register the first day they helped a minister defective medicine like cancer drugs.Every NHS nurse has helped with such criminal medicine! So each and every Dr. and nurse within the NHS, the struck off up to 18 years ago!Patience get the return of all medical fees from their struck off medical team and family is get 10,000,000 UK pounds for each family member medicated to death.Each involved Dr. Gets 25 years custodial jail in high security jail. The jail time appropriate for the struck off nurses, is a matter for the lawyers! Every dispensing pharmacist read the Moffitt Paper. And so realized cancer drugs were criminal medicine. And could not be legally dispensed for 18 years.Or each and every dispensing pharmacist struck off! Barred from Medical Service for life.Every infective bacteria, is given a minimal cell wall by the immune system -mistaking them for useful empathic bacterial. The bacteria and causes the cells to be inflated. So they can divide a multiply.\u00bd minute of HIUS to each side the chest totally clears all bacterial infections. Fungal antibiotic medicine has been medical malpractice for 18 years.Viruses handle their own cell division. But again require viral infected cells to have and overinflated nature, to induce cell replication.This includes Corona. The present in a cent viral infection in China. Again \u00bd minute of HIUS to each side the chest will totally clear everybody of a virus.Each of the 175 people who had died from Corona, warrants a payout of 90 million Renimbe. As every Dr. has the validated HIUS years in the nursing office. To validate the cancer cure 2002.Not to have validated HIUS after the Moffitt Paper, was to strike the Dr. off the medical register instantly. The Moffitt Paper also covered the cure of all viruses.So Corona virus can be totally cured in 1 minute. It is such a trivial problem! The next academic will be an outbreak of an antibiotic resistant bacterial infection.Which can be cured instantly by 1 minute of HIUS to the chest! All infective disease has been cured.Which stops the formation of cancers, heart disease, diabetes and mental health issues. The total profits of Health Systems around the world. The other medicines lose money!All prescribing doctors struck off 18 years ago. Along with every drug company on earth.",

It was affirmed by Mr. Zarak Khan, President PCJCCI, in a press statement issued here today. He applauded China\u2019s efforts to cope with the crisis amicably.\nHighlighting the brighter side of China in this miserable situation, he told that Chinese government had completed the world\u2019s largest hospital with the total covered area of 25,000 square meter bearing 1000 beds just in 10 days only. Further, he appreciated that Chinese doctors were also working to prepare vaccine for corona virus by gathering the country\u2019s top microbiologists. He paid high tributes to China for being so determined and hard working in coping with the calamities caused by this miserable disease.\nMr. Zarak Khan said, \u201cWhen H1N1 virus broke out in the US in 2009 no one called it \u201cAmerica Virus, then why when this novel corona virus broke out in China we are calling it \u201cChina Virus\u201d. He urged the people of Pakistan to stand by the Chinese people at this hour of need. He said this is the time to reciprocate the love and support to China, which we had been receiving from China in all odd times faced by us in the past.\nZarak Khan informed that Corona Virus was initially found in the famous city of China \u201cWuhan\u201d which is known as the \u201cTransport Hub\u201d of China. The virus further forced China to close 14 economic hubs which has adversely destroyed the economy of China through the loss of 60 million dollars, he said adding that Companies like iPhone, Disney and Tesla had closed their offices in China. But, the President PCJCCI said that the Chinese Nation is very strong and energetic. He was confident that China would soon overcome the crisis and revive economic losses within a short span of time.\nHe further informed that a virus similar to Corona Virus, the Great Plague was spread in England between 1665 and 1666, which led to the deaths of 75,000 to 100,000 people. Similarly, in 1493, Christopher Columbus and his men, who embarked on the Second Colombian Expedition from America to the New World were suffering from the virus of Influenza and through them it spread among the people of Spain killing more than 5 million people. Therefore, the President PCJCCI urged the world\u2019s community not to blame China for the prevailing clamity of Corona Virus. It should be coped as a common problem of the world, instead of maligning the Chinese Nation.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Moazzam Ghurki, Senior Vice President and Mr. Salahuddin Hanif, Secretary General of PCJCCI have also expressed the equal concern over the Crisis to be faced by China due to Corona Virus. They have pledged to start a fund-raising scheme to provide medical aid for the victims of Corona virus.\n",

But the lack of preparedness for the really, really big threats may be met with virtual radio silence\u2014until panic breaks out.\nThe worst, possibly existential, threat is the stealthy, invisible one that multiplies exponentially\u2014in the accurate sense of the term: 400 cases today, 800 tomorrow, then 1600, 3200, 6400, 128000, 256000, 512000, and 1.024 million after only eight doubling times. Biological threats proliferate\u2014until they run out of susceptible victims.\nIn 1918, the great influenza pandemic killed as many people in 11 months as the medieval Black Death did in 4 years. Ultimately, at least 50 million may have perished. Young healthy people, especially young soldiers headed off to the front in World War I, succumbed quickly. To avoid interfering with the war effort, the U.S. government denied and covered up the threat, preventing the implementation of public health measures.\nSince then, the world has gotten smaller. A virus that jumps the species barrier from animals to humans in a meat market in China can cross the Pacific in hours. And despite the expenditure of $80 billion on a National Biologic Defense, the U.S. is arguably no better prepared than it was in 1918, state Steven Hatfill, M.D., and coauthors in their new book Three Seconds until Midnight .\nAs in 1918, we lack a vaccine or wonder drugs, but must rely on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and on public health authorities to track and try to contain the spread of infection.\nAccurate information is critical. Can we trust governmental authorities to tell the truth? Travel restrictions, quarantine, closing businesses, and cancelling public events have a huge economic and potential political cost.\nThere can also be incentives to exaggerate the threat, in order to sell poorly tested vaccines or drugs. The 1976 swine flu epidemic was almost a non-event; more people were probably injured or even died from adverse effects of the heavily promoted vaccine.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has so far declined to declare the corona virus outbreak a global emergency, although cases have been reported in more than a dozen or so countries. China reported only hundreds of \u201cconfirmed\u201d cases\u2014while countless additional cases were not tested because of lack of diagnostic test kits.\nThe New England Journal of Medicine writes , \u201cAnother Decade, Another Coronavirus.\u201d This 2019-nCoV virus is the third zoonotic (animal) coronavirus to infect humans in two decades. The SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) were contained. Other coronaviruses cause mild cold-like syndromes.\nThis virus has occasioned the quarantine of entire cities, for the first time since medieval times. This could not be done other than in authoritarian China, states virologist Steven Hatfill , but even there is unlikely to be effective\u2014especially if 5 million people had left before the order was implemented.\nThe People\u2019s Liberation Army has sent 450 medical personnel to Wuhan to help out at local hospitals, which are crammed with patients lying in packed corridors. Construction workers are reportedly trying to build a 1,000-bed hospital in Wuhan in five days. The U.S. and other nations are evacuating their citizens from Wuhan.\nA report of 41 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, published in The Lancet , showed that patients were relatively young (median age 49) and fewer than half had an underlying illness. Only 66% had been exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the apparent source of the infection. One patient (2%) had no fever; all had pneumonia; 29% had severe respiratory distress syndrome; and 12% had acute cardiac injury. Most cases may be very mild, facilitating more rapid spread .\nThe corona virus is transmitted by droplets coming into contact with mucous membranes, including the eye. It can persist on surfaces for days. People without fever or symptoms can transmit the illness during the incubation period, which might be as long as two weeks. At present, definitive diagnostic testing is available only from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) .\nIn a severe outbreak, people whose job is not critical may need to stay home. Those who do not have a supply of food, essential medications, or other needed supplies would likely end up in a frantic crowd. Personal protective gear, for people who need to be in contact with the public or care for a sick family member, is already out of stock in medical supply houses. This includes gloves, wrap-around eye protection, and N-95 protective masks\u2014regular surgical masks are probably of little help.\nPanic is never helpful; staying calm is always good advice. But failure to heed previous warnings of the need for robust disaster planning, and complacency about medical technology and governmental resources, has set the stage for potential unprecedented disaster.\nIndividuals need to recognize that they themselves, and not 911 or the emergency room or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, may hold the key to their family\u2019s and their community\u2019s survival. Local authorities need to know that they may be on their own.\nFor now, stock up on supplies; cover those coughs and sneezes; wash hands frequently for at least 20 seconds; avoid crowds; and stay aware, as the situation could change rapidly.\n",

Do e-mail me, I like people! Hi. Doctors and Professors, talk to me. Saturday, 8 February 2020 Corona/C19 is cured so simply Ultrasound\u2014Cancer Cure: Cheap Home Cure to All Cancers Price: \u00a313.41 (excl. VAT) Prints in 3-5 business days Ultrasound\u2014Cancer Cure explores a perspective and revolutionary new treatment for cancer: high-intensity ultrasound, a noninvasive but promising new treatment that is being studied as a way to treat all cancers and could even cure in just one application. Author Dr. Jon Thomason shares research from the Moffitt Cancer Center, which pioneered research into this application of ultrasound, and he explains both how ultrasound works and how, more importantly, it can be used to as a treatment for cancer. Chemotherapy and surgery are not the only options for patients suffering from cancer. Ultrasound is a promising new alternative that could offer a noninvasive treatment without the debilitating side-effects of radiation and surgery. Certificate of registration The US library of congress has just registered 'Ultrasound \u2013 Cheap Home Cure To All Cancers' TX 8-659-428 2002 and 3 medical professors from the Moffitt cancer centre published the single application of High Intensity UltraSound to a cancerous organ, to clear cancer.As it was medically published On earth had to acquire and validated a HIUS device. An 8 W 1 MHz ultrasound massage device is a home beauty device that also functions as a HIUS device. \u00a321.28 Free P&P The original work was done on prostate cancer. I apply the HIUS for 1 minute 1.5\" above a man's penis, and the most prevalent mail specific cancer is cured.It works for all 200 cancers out there. Sir just one prescription of the defective 20 a century cancer medicine, struck ealth the October. As the defective radio and chemotherapy, or massively defective cancer surgery lead to a two year decline to Bio chemically assisted death.I cured a lawyer from the British Council of his late stage inoperable liver cancer. 1 minute of HIUS along the base of the rib cage. The 2016 and the UK Crown C and ourt publish that HIUS was the only legal cancer medicine.Medics dropped biochemical treatments overnight but reverted to more defective chemo and radio therapy, and surgery. Every surgeon who has applied cancer surgery in last 18 years, instantly ceased to be a registered Dr. the same day and subsequent surgical work criminal!It became apparent 2002 that HIUS also clears all viruses on demand. \u00bd minute of e.g. 8 W 1 MHz ultrasound to each side the chest will totally clear Corona.By every medic on earth 2002. 2003 by every Dr. also validated that HIUS cleared all bacterial infections. Including antibiotic resistant infections!Prescription of fungal antibiotics became criminal and defective medicine. Striking off the prescribing Dr. the same day! All subsequent medical practice was criminal medical malpractice.Corona is cleared by HIUS! My friend in New York used high us to clear his HIV AIDs 2012. He was discharged from all AIDs medicine the next week by his GP. I've published the use freely on the Internet.Validated by every AIDs Dr. In the world. Amino acid blockers an anti retroviral treatments were criminal medicine for HIV, even before the drug companies dreamt them up.Every Corona patient in Wuhan, all around the world can be cleared of this week viral infection: SARs was five times as lethal, but was cleared by application of HIUS 2003.So the Chinese doctors already knew of a medically validated a viral cure. 17 years ago! They already had the required validated HIUS Equipment. As did every Dr. Around the world.So biochemical treatments for viruses, criminal medicine for 18 years. Corona is cleared by 1 minute of HIUS. The Chinese panic, is PR from the drug companies.Who all validated the HIUS cure! Which works for all viruses are will ever exist. So were prohibited from the manufacture of cancer drugs from 2002.But every drug company has continued with the manufacture and sale or cancer drugs. In exactly the same way that Has denied they can simply cure all viruses. Without any drug prescription.Both groups struck off their medical registers. Doctors losing Health Insurance and medical registration, making subsequent medical practice totally criminal!The assisting nurses and pharmacists, both groups totally aware that HIUS cured cancer and viruses, were prohibited from assisting with defective medicine like cancer drugs.Both struck off their respective health registers. Continue to work in the health sector then criminal. So Boots and Lloyds are chemist in the UK, have lost all their registered pharmacists.As are every pharmacist in the U.S. or globally. Since cancer was cures 18 years ago, drug company is have announced regular global epidemics. That all fizzle out!As doctors remember that HIUS clears all viral infections. And actually Obey their professional medical oath, and cure the viral infections.2003 Asia had SARs - the five times as fatal as Corona. But suddenly dies out as doctors were reminded they had to use HIUS! Or be struck off.In Wuhan every Dr. has the validated HIUS device. That will cure all Corona infections. Those that have used defective biochemical remedies, the struck off. A legal fine of 90,000,000 Renimbe, and 25 years in high security jail. For every murderous Dr..Who has delighted in medicating their Corono patients to death. From a condition routinely cleared by 1 minute of HIUS.Around the developed world HIUS will clear all Corona outbreaks. I am really are appalled that I have to remind global doctors and of their professional oath. 1know about new medical advances 2use them 3free use of medicine then criminal! 4no research or teaching of defective medicineResulting me every medical academic in the world, the ceased to be medically registered 2002. Even Harvard in Cambridge Medical schools, the struck off 18 years ago!All their graduating medical students, never registered doctors. All other medical practice subsequently, criminal medical malpractice. They it never has health insurance or medical registration.",

Thursday's announcement came after China reported the largest increase in mortality in a day.\nReported by AFP and the AP, the WHO is revising its risk assessment for the corona virus. The corona virus killed 170 people in China.\n\"Our biggest concern is the potential spread of the virus in countries with weaker health systems,\" said WHO official Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus during a briefing in Geneva cited by the WHO. 39; AFP Friday (01/31/2020).\n\"We must all act together to limit the spread \u2026 we can only stop it together,\" he added.\nHowever, Tedros said there is no need to restrict travel and trade with China in order to stem the spread of the virus. The Corona virus is known to spread in 15 countries around the world.\nTedros said the main reason for the statement was not due to what had happened in China. Indeed, the corona virus is spread in dozens of countries.\n\"The main reason for this statement is not because of what happened in China but because of the situation in other countries,\" said Tedros.\n\"This declaration is not a vote of no confidence in China. Instead, WHO continues to have confidence in China's ability to control the plague,\" said Tedros.\nMany countries have warned their citizens not to visit China, some have banned tourists from Wuhan, China, where the virus first appeared.\nThe United States has reported the first case of someone contracting the corona virus. A Chicago man contracted the disease from his wife who traveled to Wuhan.\nThe airline started on Wednesday to cancel flights to China.\nIsrael prohibits all flights from China. Meanwhile, Russia has said it will close its direct border with China.\nIn addition, more than 6,000 tourists have been temporarily detained on cruise ships in the Italian port after two Chinese passengers were isolated for fear that they might carry the virus. The first results of the tests showed that the two people were negative.\n",

Epidemics of infectious disease are generally caused by several factors including a change in the ecology of the host population. Generally, an epidemic occurs when host immunity to either an established pathogen or newly emerging novel pathogen is suddenly reduced below that found in the endemic equilibrium and the transmission threshold is exceeded. The epidemic triangle is essentially an equation. It posits that every outbreak, regardless of its specific traits, is dependent on the interplay between three factors: the pathogen (the agent causing infection), the host (the organism at risk of infection) and the environment (the setting where the infections occur). Every single epidemic \u2014 be it the flu, cholera or even behavioral epidemics like drunken driving \u2014 is the result of a dynamic shift in one of these points of the epidemic triangle, which then causes a domino effect leading to a sudden explosion of new cases.\n\"A rose by any other name would smell as sweet\" is a popular reference to William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet, in which Juliet seems to argue that it does not matter that Romeo is from her family's rival house of Montague, that is, that he is named \"Montague\". The reference is often used to imply that the names of things do not affect what they really are.\nThe whole World is concerned and talking about a deadly virus, derived from that word meaning crown or halo, which refers to the characteristic appearance of the virus particles (virions): they have a fringe reminiscent of a crown or of a solar corona. A corona (meaning 'crown' in Latin derived from Ancient Greek) is an aura of plasma that surrounds the Sun and other stars. The Sun's corona extends millions of kilometres into outer space and is most easily seen during a total solar eclipse, but it is also observable with a coronagraph. Light from the corona comes from three primary sources, from the same volume of space.\nThe news is the coronavirus causing a deadly outbreak in China has been named COVID-19 , the World Health Organization has announced. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the global body, announced the new name at a conference in Geneva this afternoon. It comes almost six weeks after the virus was first identified in the city of Wuhan, China, in late December. Since then it has infected more than 43,000 people and killed 1,018. The virus, which has had various names from simply coronavirus to Wuhan coronavirus, Chinese coronavirus or even snake flu, needs its own moniker because it is just one type of coronavirus.\nThe word refers to a group of viruses which contains those that cause SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). Coronaviruses are so named because their structure has jagged edges which look like a royal crown \u2013 corona is crown in Latin. 'Under agreed guidelines between WHO, the World Organization for Animal Health and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations we had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual or group of people, and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease. 'Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatising. It also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks. A name had been expected since scientists at the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) last week announced they had decided on one.\nThe name COVID-19 has now been approved and will hopefully be used by 'everybody', the WHO said, to avoid stigmatising or confusing names. It also allows for it to refer to the 'entire spectrum of clinical conditions' which the virus can cause, said WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan, meaning it is not specific to certain symptoms. SARS and MERS on the other hand, have names which only refer to the effects they have on the lungs \u2013 the respiratory effects \u2013 and not anything else. The World Health Organization has an international set of rules which scientists must follow when proposing new names for a virus. They must not contain references to certain places in the world, communities, human names or animals because they may cause a 'backlash' or racism. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome is listed as a bad example, as well as Spanish Flu, Lyme disease, Japanese encephalitis, swine flu, bird flu and monkey pox. Other words to avoid are ones which might induce fear, such as 'unknown', 'death', 'fatal' or 'epidemic'.\nSo that deadly epidemic that has caused death of more than 1000 people in China has a name. Streets wear a deserted look in Beijing, a city home to more than 20million people, as people stay home out of fear of catching the virus. Hazmat-wearing laboratory technicians are pictured talking to residents of the city of Linyi, where they are investigating the virus. The danger when you don't have an official name is that people start using terms like China Virus, and that can create a backlash against certain populations.\nHealth bulletins state that someone who is infected with the COVID-19 coronavirus can spread it with just a simple cough or a sneeze. At least 1,000 people with the virus are now confirmed to have died and more than 43,000 have been infected in at least 28 countries and regions. But some media predict the true number of people with the disease could be 100,000, or even as high as 350,000 in Wuhan alone, as they warn it may kill as many as two in 100 cases.\nA coronavirus (now COVID 19) is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. Scientists state that Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. According to scientists, the virus has almost certainly come from bats. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in the city, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was.\nExperts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take long time and huge amounts of money. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public.\n",

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies ] To: catnipman If you were going to \u2018engineer\u2019 a coronavirus in order to weaponize it, a very good place to start would be in altering the envelope proteins - such that the virus could bind to different receptors that the wild-type virus. HIV envelope proteins have a limited repertoire of what they'll bind to, so altering the envelope proteins of coronavirus to make it more like those of HIV would not be a good strategy.\nConversely, if you were trying to engineer new envelope proteins into coronavirus, you might take some of the sequences of HIV envelope proteins (e.g. those sequences that encode a region allowing anchoring/embedding in the lipid envelope) - and then add different sequences to the receptor-binding region of the envelope protein, creating a hybrid envelope protein with only a small amount of HIV sequences.\nThe bottom line is that the sequencing they've done doesn't exclude, nor conclude that genetic engineering was performed on this strain of coronavirus. I am assuming it wasn't genetically engineered, but such a thing is definitely possible. 11 posted on 01/31/2020 9:08:44 PM PST by neverevergiveup To: Bommer\nBecause they were used to treat SARS, it was assumed they may work for this virus. 12 posted on 01/31/2020 9:09:04 PM PST by Brellium (\"Thou shalt not shilly shally!\" Aron Nimzowitsch) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies ] To: Bommer My nightmare scenario is for this to be a bioweapon intended to use a flu virus as a vector to transmit AIDS, which normally requires a blood-to-blood connection.\nIn other words, years after infection by the coronavirus, the victim develops AIDS. 13 posted on 01/31/2020 9:11:19 PM PST by Publius (\"Who is John Galt?\" by Billthedrill & Publius available at Amazon.)

        "content": "The World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) has prepared an advisory document offering guidance and a series of Frequently Asked Questions to help to communicate and distinguish fact from fiction and what is known to still unknown concerning the risk of infection with the new coronavirus (2019 n-CoV), following the outbreak in China and the issue of whether we can share this latest corona virus with companion animals or visa versa .\nDr Michael Lappin, chair of the WSAVA\u2019s One Health Committee, recommends that veterinarians tell owners to: keep their companion animals with them if they are self-quarantined keep cats inside arrange care for any animals left at home if family or friends are hospitalized contact their veterinarian immediately if they have questions or concerns.\nThe WSAVA\u2019s Scientific Committee and One Health Committee have worked together to produce the advisory document, which confirms that there is currently no evidence that pets or other domestic animals can be infected with 2019 n-CoV or that they may be a source of infection to people. They do warn, though, that it is a \u2018rapidly evolving situation\u2019.\nThe advisory also cautions veterinarians against using vaccines against canine enteric coronavirus available in some global markets in the hope that they may offer some cross-protection against 2019-nCoV. There is no evidence for this, as the new virus is a distinctly different coronavirus variant.\nWSAVA President Dr Shane Ryan said: \u201cThere is still much we don\u2019t know about 2019-CoV and, while the priority is to bring the outbreak of the infection caused to people under control as soon as possible, we are concerned for animal welfare with reports of animals being abandoned or killed because their owners fear that they might carry the virus. There is no evidence that this is necessary and we urge our members to ensure owners follow our guidance and keep themselves and their companion animals safe.\u201d\nWSAVA\u2019s Scientific and One Health Committees Advisory Document is printed word per word below.\nWSAVA represents more than 200,000 veterinarians worldwide through its 113 member associations. Its core activities include the development of WSAVA Global Guidelines in key areas of veterinary practice, including pain management, nutrition and vaccination, and the provision of continuing education.\nThe work of WSAVA\u2019s One Health Committee is generously supported by WSAVA Diamond Partner, Purina Institute . WSAVA Scientific and One Health Committees Advisory Document Regarding the New Corona Virus\nAn outbreak of pneumonia in people in China has been drawing worldwide concern about a new coronavirus (termed 2019-nCoV) as a global public health risk. The new coronavirus was identified after notification of pneumonia cases of unknown cause in December 2019, diagnosed initially in the Chinese city of Wuhan, capital of Hubei province. Thousands of cases have already been detected in China, and the disease has been exported by travelers to many other countries. Initially, there was no clear evidence for person-to-person transmission. In the last few weeks, however, person-to-person spread of the 2019-nCoV has been confirmed, as shown by new cases of viral pneumonia among family members and health care providers through close contact.\nIn January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) temporarily named the new virus as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). While more cases are being reported on a daily basis in China and elsewhere, the exact source of the outbreak is still not known, but the origin is believed to be linked to the Huanan South China Seafood Market, a seafood and live animal \u2018wet market\u2019 in Wuhan. Currently, there is no evidence suggesting a specific animal host as a virus reservoir, and further investigations are ongoing.\nCoronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae. Alpha- and beta-coronaviruses usually infect mammals, while gamma and delta coronaviruses usually infect birds and fish. Canine coronavirus, which can cause mild diarrhea and feline coronavirus, which can cause feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), are both alpha-coronaviruses.\nUntil the appearance of 2019-nCoV, which belong to the betacoronaviruses, there were only six known coronaviruses capable of infecting humans and causing respiratory disease, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV (identified in 2002/2003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS-CoV (identified in 2012). 2019-nCoV is more genetically related to SARS than MERS, but both are beta-coronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don\u2019t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS and MERS, we can use the information from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us.\nIn the last few weeks, rapid progresses have been made in the identification of viral etiology, isolation of infectious virus and the development of diagnostic tools. However, there are still many important questions that remain to be answered. The most up-to-date information and advice on human infection can be found on the WHO https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) and the CDC websites ( https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/about/index.html .\nThe most up-to-date information related to animal health and the corona virus is available at https://www.oie.int/scientific-expertise/specific-information-andrecommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus FAQ\u2019s\nIn response to this outbreak, the WSAVA Scientific and One Health Committees have prepared the following list of frequently asked questions with the help of Prof. Scott Weese, University of Guelph, Canada. We are aware of issues related to pet abandonment in China and hope that this information will be of use to veterinarians in dealing with the concerns:\nCan 2019-nCoV infect domestic animals?\nCurrently there is no evidence that pets or other domestic animals can be infected with this new coronavirus. Additionally, there is currently no evidence that pets or other domestic animals might be a source of infection to people with the new coronavirus. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.\nShould I avoid contact with pets or other animals if I am sick?\nDo not handle pets or other animals while sick. Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with 2019-nCoV, several types of coronaviruses can cause illness in animals and spread between animals and people. Until we know more, avoid contact with animals and wear a facemask if you must be around animals or care for a pet in order to protect the pet from the possibility of disease transmission.\nWhat should I do if my pet or other animal becomes ill and was around a person with novel coronavirus?\nIf your pet or other animal becomes ill, call your veterinarian to let them know that you are bringing a sick pet that was exposed to a person with the new coronavirus. Do not take the animal to a veterinary clinic until you have had a discussion with clinic staff. Tell them about any contact the animal may have had with someone with 2019-nCoV infection.\nIf my pet or other animal has been in contact with someone who is sick, can they spread the disease to other people?\nWe do not yet know if animals can get infected. We also do not know if they could get sick from this new coronavirus. Currently there is no evidence that pets or other domestic animals can be infected with this new coronavirus. Additionally, there is currently no evidence that pets or other domestic animals might be a source of infection to people with the new coronavirus. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. What are the concerns regarding pets that have been in contact with people infected with this virus? While this virus seems to have emerged from an animal source, it is now spreading from person-to-person. Person-to-person spread is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. At this time, it\u2019s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people. Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses. Importantly, there is no data to date that dogs and cats can become infected with 2019-nCoV.\nWhat should be done with animals in areas where the virus is active?\nCurrently there is no evidence that pets or other domestic animals can be infected with this new coronavirus. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with 2019- nCoV, several types of coronaviruses can cause illness in animals and spread between animals and people. Until we know more, avoid contact with animals and wear a facemask if you must be around animals or care for a pet. However, people diagnosed with 2019-nCoV should stay away from pets to help protect the pet from the potential for disease spread.\nShould veterinarians start to vaccinate dogs against canine coronavirus because of the risk of 2019-nCoV?\nThe canine coronavirus vaccines available in some global markets are intended to protect against enteric coronavirus infection and are NOT licensed for protection against respiratory infections. Veterinarians should NOT use such vaccines in the face of the current outbreak thinking that there may be some form of cross-protection against 2019-nCoV. There is absolutely no evidence that vaccinating dogs with the commercially available vaccines will provide cross-protection against the infection by the 2019-nCoV, since the enteric and respiratory viruses are distinctly different variants of coronavirus. No vaccines are currently available in any market for respiratory coronavirus infection in the dog. ",

        "content": "For Japan, the last decade exhibited a period of remarkable growth for tourism to Japan. The number of people visiting Japan increased from just 6.2 million people in 2011 to 31.2 million in 2018, which is a faster rate of growth over that period compared to any other major tourist destination. The relaxation of visa requirements, particularly for Chinese citizens, and a drop in the value of the yen made Japan an attractive destination. However, after years of dramatic growth, Japan\u2019s tourism numbers plateaued from 2018 to 2019. The stagnation was mainly due to a decline in South Korean visitors. Tourists from other major sources of visitors like China, Taiwan, and the US continued to climb. The drop in South Korean tourists was due to a trade war between Japan and South Korea. The trade war began in July 2019, with the Japanese government restricting the export of chemical materials to South Korea that are important to the South Korean consumer electronics industry. The tensions between the two countries continued throughout the second half of 2019. In late July, South Koreans started boycotting Japanese products and canceling visits to Japan. This had a huge impact on Japanese tourism. Japanese tourism to South Korea also dropped down, but to a lesser extent. Japan\u2019s tourism industry is not likely to rebound this year even though Tokyo looks forward to receiving a boost from hosting the Olympics, due to a new threat amid the continuing trade dispute with South Korea. The corona virus emerging from China, and which has spread to around 30 countries, could crush Japan\u2019s aim of hosting 40 million visitors in 2020. China, which is the biggest source of tourists to Japan, banned group outward travel in January and flights between Japan and China are sharply down. Hence, Japan\u2019s tourism industry is likely to suffer.",

Their economies have been battered by weeks of quarantine-fueled job losses and soaring unemployment claims, yet health officials warn that lifting stay-at-home orders now could spark a resurgence of COVID-19.\nThe coronavirus has killed more than 190,000 people worldwide, including - as of Friday - more than 50,000 in the United States, according to a tally compiled by John Hopkins University from government figures. The actual death toll is believed to be far higher.\nNew cases are surging in Africa and Latin America as outbreaks subside in some places that were hit earlier.\nIn Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt authorized personal-care businesses to open, citing a decline in the number of people being hospitalized for COVID-19. Those businesses were directed to maintain social distancing, require masks and frequently sanitize equipment.\nStill, some of the state\u2019s largest cities, including Norman, Oklahoma City and Tulsa, were opting to keep their bans in place until at least the end of April.\nAmy Pembrook and her husband, Mike, reopened their hair salon in the northwest Oklahoma town of Fairview after it had been shuttered for about a month.\n\u201cWe\u2019re super excited about going back, but we have caught a little flack from people who say it\u2019s too early,\" Amy Pembrook said. \"We just said we can live in fear for a long time or we can trust that everything is going to be OK.\u201d\nWith deaths and infections still rising in Georgia, many business owners planned to stay closed despite Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s assurance that hospital visits and new cases have leveled off enough for barbers, tattoo artists, massage therapists and personal trainers to return to work with restrictions.\nKemp\u2019s timeline to restart the economy proved too ambitious even for President Donald Trump, who said he disagrees with the fellow Republican\u2019s plan.\nOn Friday, Trump signed a $484 billion bill to aid employers and hospitals under stress from the pandemic - the latest federal effort to help keep afloat businesses that have had to close or scale down. Over the past five weeks, roughly 26 million people have filed for jobless aid, or about 1 in 6 U.S. workers.\nWithout a tried-and-tested action plan for how to pull countries out of coronavirus lockdown, the world is seeing a patchwork of approaches. Schools reopen in one country, stay closed in others; face masks are mandatory in some places, a recommendation elsewhere.\nKids still attend soccer practice in Sweden while they are not even allowed outside in Spain. As governments and scientists fumble around, still struggling with so many unknowns, individuals are being left to take potentially life-affecting decisions.\nIn Georgia, David Huynh had 60 clients booked for appointments at his nail salon in Savannah, but a clothing store, jewelry shop and chocolatier that share a street corner with his downtown business, Envy Nail Bar, remained closed.\n\u201cThe phone\u2019s been staying ringing off the hook,\u201d Huynh said. \u201cWe\u2019ve probably gotten hundreds of calls in the last hour.\u201d\nFour women clutching face masks were waiting outside when the salon opened for the first time since March 26.\n\u201cYes, I am ready to get my nails fixed,\u201d said Alina Davis, a police officer for the local school system, who kept working throughout the crisis.\nMeanwhile, Nikki Thomas is overdue for a visit to her hair stylist, but she\u2019s barely ventured outside her house in the six weeks since she's been working from home. She had no plans to change that now just because of Kemp\u2019s decision.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously extremely stupid and I\u2019m simultaneously exhausted and so angry I can barely see straight,\u201d Thomas, 40, said in a phone interview.\nThe gradual reopenings come as coronavirus testing continues to lag across the United States. To date, according to data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project, just under 4.7 million people have been tested in the country of 330 million people.\nA lack of tests and supplies has hampered the U.S. effort from the beginning. About 193,000 people were tested on Thursday. That\u2019s an increase from the two-week daily average of 163,000, but far less than what public health experts estimate is needed to get a handle on the virus.\nResearchers at Harvard have estimated a minimum of 500,000 daily tests are needed, and possibly much more, in order to safely reopen the economy.\nIn Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer lengthened her stay-at-home order through May 15, while lifting restrictions so some businesses can reopen and the public can participate in outdoor activities like golf and motorized boating during the coronavirus pandemic.\nMichigan has nearly 3,000 deaths related to COVID-19, behind only New York and New Jersey among U.S. states.\nNew York reported its lowest number of daily COVID-19 deaths in weeks on Friday. The state recorded 422 deaths as of the day before - the fewest since March 31, when it recorded 391 deaths. More than 16,000 people have died in the state from the outbreak.\nIn Denver, Mayor Michael Hancock extended the city\u2019s stay-at-home order and non-essential business closures through May 8 just as Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a fellow Democrat, prepared to relax some statewide restrictions next week.\nHealth officials in Colorado ordered the immediate closure of a Walmart in Aurora, a Denver suburb, after three people connected to the store died after being infected with the coronavirus and at least six employees tested positive.\nIn France, the government is leaving families to decide whether to keep children at home or send them back to class when the nationwide lockdown, in place since March 17, starts to be eased May 11.\nIn Spain, parents face a similarly knotty decision: whether to let kids get their first fresh air in weeks when the country starts Sunday to ease the total ban on letting them outside.\nThe slowing of Spain\u2019s horrific outbreak, which has killed more than 22,500 people, made the prospect of letting kids out feasible. For the first time Friday, Spanish health authorities counted more people recovering from the disease in a 24-hour span than new infections.",

Sidi Abdullahi with reference number NCAA/DG/AMS/Vol. 1. /30, put all Airline Operators, Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP) and Aerodrome Operators on that alert.\nIn the 9-point letter sent to the airlines, all operators ara required to carry out the following:\n\u201cPilots in Command (PIC) of aircraft are to report to the Air Traffic Control (ATC) any suspected cases of communicable disease on board an aircraft in line with Nig. CARs 18.8.22.4;\n\u201cIn case of a suspected case of communicable disease on board an aircraft, the aircrew are to fill the aircraft General Declaration (Gen Dec) in line with Nig.

Completed aircraft General Declaration are to be submitted to the Port Health Services (PHS) on arrival at the designated point of entry.\n\u201cSick passengers on board an aircraft are to be required by the crew to fill a Passenger Locator form in line with Nig.CARs 18.8.22.5. The completed Passenger Locator Forms are to be submitted to Port Health Services (PHS) on arrival at the designated point of entry.\n\u201cAirlines are to have onboard the appropriate number of First Aid Kits, Universal Precaution kits and Emergency Medical kits according to the provisions of Nig.CARs 7.9.1.11 and 7.9.1.12.\n\u201cAirlines are to update the knowledge of their crew members in the handling of communicable disease on board an aircraft.\n\u201cCabin crew should follow the operational procedures recommended by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and their airlines\u2019 Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) in handling possible cases of communicable diseases on board an aircraft. They are to ensure that passengers with symptoms of acute respiratory infection exercises cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues and wash hands thoroughly.\n\u201cPassengers should be encouraged by the crew to self-report if they feel ill.\n\u201cAirlines are to contact Port Health Services for clearance before importing human remains into the country.\n\u201cDesignated Points of Entries are to ensure (i) stakeholders collaboration in the handling of a suspected case of communicable disease in line with their respective Public Health Emergency Contingency Plans (PHECPs), (ii) Routine measures, train staff, provide appropriate space, stockpiling of adequate equipment (including Personal Protective Equipment) should be in place at Points of Entries for assessing and managing ill travellers detected before travel, on board aircraft and on arrival,(iii) Procedures and means are in place for communicating information on ill travellers between aircraft and point of entries as well as between POEs and National Health Authorities (iv) Safe transportation of symptomatic passengers to hospitals or designated facilities for clinical assessment and treatment is organised;\n\u201cAirlines and POEs are to report to the Authority in writing any suspected case of communicable disease observed in flight or at any Point of Entry (POE) \u2013 International Airport.\n\u201cThe Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) therefore expects strict compliance to the Standard and Recommended Practices (SARPs) as enumerated above.

Ugly bug, no?\nThere is no evidence that the Corona Virus is spread by Corona Beer, though considerable research continues on this logical connection. If I were not so spooked by Mexico these days, I would take a sabbatical to study it myself. Why is your Spider Sense tingling, Big Red Car?\nI don\u2019t trust the Chinese about anything. I think the Chinese are under reporting the size of the pandemic because of national pride.\nIt is clear this is a huge problem as the virus is being systematically distributed to the world \u2014 now being found in the United States, England, France, Thailand, Australia, Germany, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Nepal, Finland, Cambodia, India, Singapore, and Russia.\nAhh, the wonders and benefits of air travel.\nThe World Health Organization has declared a \u201cglobal emergency threat.\u201d\nChinese President for Life +10 Years Xi Jinping has called it a \u201cdemon\u201d virus, a \u201cdemon\u201d epidemic. [Note: The simple fact that Xi Jinping commented on the Corona Virus tells you something.]\nThe numbers are moving quickly \u2014 quicker than it is possible to report them. There are an admitted more than 10,000 Chinese infected and more than 200 deaths.\nMy Spider Sense says those numbers could be 100,000 infected and 10,000 dead. China has locked down 60,000,000 persons in the Wuhan area. Seems a big move. What\u2019s the Big Deal, Big Red Car?\nThe Big Deal is caused by the lack of real information as to what the Corona Virus actually is.\nSymptoms are said to be cough, fever, shortness of breath, but field reports say it may have very little symptoms and still be communicable.\nBig Pharma says it can produce a vaccine, but it will take a year or more to deliver. They have already been able to grow the CV in the lab \u2014 huge milestone. Meanwhile, they are trying out some promising HIV drugs that they speculate may be effective.\nSo, right now if you get infected, you have to treat the symptoms and ride it out.\nThe other troubling development was the recognition that it could be transmitted from person-to-person. That is not completely novel, but taken with the fact that symptoms may not show up for 14 days, this is a real complication. Perspective, Big Red Car?\nYes, dear reader, we need some perspective, don\u2019t we? Let me share some info as it relates to influenza in the United States. I like to look at the flu numbers because it is almost completely avoidable by receiving a damn flu shot. Hello, America? Flu shots?\nThese US numbers are only for the time period of 1 October 2019 to 20 January 2020. They are illuminating. Total cases of flu: 19-26,000,000 <<< the US population is 330,000,000 Total flu medical visits: 9-12,000,000 Total flu hospitalizations: 180-310,000 Flu deaths: 10-25,000 <<< fewer than 8,000 US military KIAs total in Iraq and Afghanistan\nThis info is based on a mathematical model founded on actual collected data through the US Center for Disease Control\u2019s US Influenza Surveillance System.\nAs you can see, the flu in the US this winter is a Big Deal. Bottom line it, Big Red Car\nSo, here\u2019s the bottom line.\nThe world is dealing with an unknown that is difficult to detect, has a 14-day incubation period, is transmittable person-to-person, may not show its symptoms clearly, and is becoming widely spread around the world. It appears to have a 2% mortality rate.\nCountries are closing borders, evacuating nationals from China, cancelling flights to China, quarantining travelers for 14 days, and monitoring the situation with great concern whilst Big Pharma says it will take a year to develop a vaccine and that is a crap shoot.\nBTW, for you capitalists: The Corona Virus has knocked the Dow down, but it will also drive jobs back to the United States. An ill wind blows good?\nI will not be eating Chinese food this weekend though I cannot imagine I am at risk with sweet-sour soup and a couple of shrimp rolls?\nMy Spider Sense tells me this one is different. Different than SARS (10% mortality rate), MERS, the Swine Flu, Ebola (90% mortality rate). I think China is not leveling with us.\nBe careful out there, amigos. Be very careful. Wash your hands, carry hand sanitizer, be very, very, very careful. Hedge your bets, PRAY.\nBut, hey, what the Hell do I really know anyway? I\u2019m just a Big Red Car. Be well.

In order to minimize the contact opportunities between the samples from infected patients and personnel in the delivery, Antwork used its automatic and unmanned operation mode, and drones from the Terra Drone Group, to accelerate the delivery. The actual transportation process saw a 50 percent increase in efficiency compared with ordinary road transportation. The use of drones for transport also allowed more staff and ambulances to be used in the front-line defense by conserving human and material resources.

Posted on Wednesday, January 22nd, 2020 by Thomas Hughes Share by Email Moderna Inc, Is A Likely Player To Develop Vaccines For Wuhan Virus\nShares of Moderna Inc ( MNRA ) surged more than 6% in premarket trading and may be headed higher. The move is driven by a growing belief it will be a major player in the development of vaccines for China\u2019s latest viral outbreak. The disease, a form of coronavirus, has already claimed the lives of nine people in China and more deaths are expected.\nThe first case of the new coronavirus has been found in the U.S. already. The victim, a male traveler from China, was found in Snohomish County, Washington and is now in isolation. Moderna is already working on vaccines for a number of commonly found illnesses so it makes sense they would tackle this one as well. Vaccines in the pipeline include those for CMV, RSV, hMPV, Zika, and H7N9 flu.\nLabeled the Wuhan Coronavirus, symptoms for most are similar to a heavy cold or onset of pneumonia. So far, more than 400 cases have been diagnosed in China. The disease is highly contagious which makes it of particular concern this week. The Chinese Lunar New Year celebration will begin this weekend, 100\u2019s of millions of people are expected to travel.\nThe CDC is already screening travelers at airports in California and New York. They will be expanding their screens to airports in Chicago, Atlanta and other airports with traffic coming from Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization will convene a panel soon to discuss making the Wuhan Virus a global health emergency. Along with the risk to world health, world leaders are thinking back to the SARS virus and its impact on the global economy.\nModerna Inc, At The Cutting Edge Of Today's Medicines\nModerna Inc is a clinical-stage biotechnology company . Clinical-stage means its vaccines and pipeline of drugs is ready to be or in the process of being tested on humans. It develops therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, and rare diseases based on messenger RNA.\nmRNA therapies are highly-advanced, cutting edge technologies that threaten to upturn the entire drug industry . They use the body as a drug-making machine, the mRNA is the means by which they do it. The mRNA delivers messages directly to cells telling them to produce complex proteins that cost millions to make in a factory.\nThe hurdle for Moderna, and others in the gene-therapy field, is that introducing the new mRNA into the body triggers an automatic response. The response includes shutting down protein production and effectively blocking any positive effects the mRNA may have. On top of that, there is concern that if the mRNA can be delivered and not trigger a negative response, it may not be able to make enough new proteins to matter.\nThe CEO Is Bullish, Clinical Trials Advance\nEven so, there is a lot of work being done. Moderna has 11 drugs in clinical trials right now and 20 development projects in the pipeline. The company has collaborative deals with top-players like Astrazenaca ( AZN ), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Merck & Co ( MRK ), and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.\nShares of Moderna got a boost a week or so ago after the company\u2019s CEO appeared on Mad Money. Bottom line, CEO Stephane Bancel is bullish on Moderna\u2019s prospects pointing out a-key drug is moving into the Phase III stage of trials. What this means is the company has proven its therapies can work, in this case for CMV (a common cold that can kill infants and elderly), now it has to prove they work better than today\u2019s standards.\nThe Technical Outlook Is Bullish For This Risky Stock\nThe technical outlook is bullish. Today\u2019s move began even before the outbreak of the Wuhan Virus and sets a new high. Sparked by the companies pipeline and outlook, this rally could have legs . The indicators support the breakout and suggest there is room for price action to run. The best targets for resistance are at the $24 and $29 levels, advances of 6% and 30% respectively.\nTraders looking to get into this move are cautioned, Moderna is a high-risk growth stock so be extra cautious with position size. Also, price action will probably pull-back to support or consolidate in sideways action before moving higher so there is no need to rush in or chase prices. Patience will pay off. ",

But the deaths are concentrated in Wuhan and neighboring area in Hubei Province, according to worldmeters.info . Here are some highlights from the website.\n97% of the country's total deaths (414) were in the Hubei Province. Mortality rate in Wuhan was 4.9%. Mortality rate nationwide was 2.1%. Fatality rate in other provinces was 0.16%. 4.9% mortality rate... That's fucking high. On the other hand, the country I reside in, Japan, now holds the highest count of corona virus case - 86. But so far, no deaths are reported.\nThis tells that the most important thing is the resource. Sadly Wuhan doesn't seem to have enough despite of they've built a gigantic hospital.

OPERATION CORONA BIO-TERROR A Complex Psyop Perpetrated to Distract,\nEnforce Mandatory Vaccinations and Coerce China to Comply with American Demands State of the Nation Everything Points to Biowarfare Being Used Against China\nby the Western Powers Which Seek to Contain Her\nGrowing Power and Influence in the World Given the multiple and serious woes that China has suffered from during 2019, it comes as no surprise that the Western powers would now resort to bioweaponry. WEAPONIZED CORONAVIRUS : \u201cBioengineered as a self-replicating weapon system\u201d If there\u2019s one last hit to the economy that China doesn\u2019t need right now, it\u2019s a global pandemic that \u2018supposedly\u2019 originated in Wuhan, the sprawling capital of Central China\u2019s Hubei province (see map below with the red marker identifying Wuhan). See how Wuhan is located right in the center of China\u2019s highly productive southeast region\u2014the economic powerhouse of the nation. This strategic location was selected for the biological attack because of the easily engineered vectors of disease dissemination as depicted by the map above. Paralyzing China\u2019s economic and financial sectors is, after all, a primary goal of this essentially Anglo-American black operation. See: Why the coronavirus is a real threat to China\u2019s economy In light of the US-staged Hong Kong protests, U.S. tariff regime against China, threat of economic sanctions against nations working with Huawei, CIA-inflamed Xinjiang conflict involving the Muslim Uyghurs, provocative sailing of US Navy warships through the Taiwan Strait, transparent political prosecution of Huawei\u2019s CFO, ravaging of China\u2019s pig farms by a bioengineered virus, etc., the Chinese government has been under withering attack since 2018. When so many debilitating assaults are suspiciously happening at once, what can China do except deal with them in a manner so as to expose the true culprits. However, China is not likely to do that in the case of this intensifying bio-war being waged by the West. SARS conspiracy theory The original SARS pandemic that took place in China after the turn of the millennium was also well-known in bio-medical circles as a naked act of biowarfare. Like this year\u2019s coronavirus bio-attack in Wuhan, the bioengineered SARS outbreak also involved a highly coordinated campaign of propaganda and disinformation. See: Is the new \u2018deadly China virus\u2019 a covert operation? However, the administration of Xi Jinping is much too concerned about the panic that would inevitably result if the populace was informed of a full-blown bioweapon attack. The precipitating chaos would simply overwhelm the government in Beijing which is already on serious overload because of the endless interference by the Anglo-American Axis. The SARS outbreak that occurred from 2002 to 2003 has already shown that China is not willing to release the hard scientific evidence that proves the premeditated release of a bioengineered coronavirus. The following excerpt from Wikipedia explains some of the background of SARS\u2014the Severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic that took place primarily in mainland China and Hong Kong, but also in Canada and other countries. Excerpt from SARS conspiracy theory Wuhan Coronavirus of 2020 The rapidly spreading Wuhan coronavirus, also known as Novel coronavirus, that was first reported in 2019 has all the hallmarks of yet another bioengineered virus in a U.S. Military laboratory. What follows is a short description form Wikipedia of this Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Time will tell whether this deadly coronavirus was released into the Chinese population with the intent to kill and sicken, scare and intimidate. The intimidation phase of such an ongoing black operation is certainly aimed at the government in Beijing which refuses to be coerced and threatened by the Trump administration. Because the highly disruptive, Western-backed Hong Kong protests have yet to yield the result desired by the U.S. State Department, it was only a matter of time before the C.I.A. implemented Plan B\u2026or is this Plan C or D? KEY POINT: The replication process (see diagram above) of this particular coronavirus, and how quickly it mutates and/or adapts to various pharmaceutical treatment regimens, will reveal exactly how this pathogenic microorganism was bioengineered. Why China? The $64,000 question here is: Why is China always the epicenter for so many strains and variations of coronaviruses, influenzas, pneumonia viruses and other highly contagious infection agents that strike the major commercial centers on southeastern mainland. What\u2019s particularly suspicious about all of these outbreaks in China is that they are each described by the Mainstream Media (MSM) as quite dangerous to human health. The mortality rate in the beginning of these eventual pandemics is especially high, as if by purposeful design of the bioengineers. In this way, the whole world is eventually drawn into a pandemic melodrama that\u2019s certainly designed to fear-monger. Hence, more of these endless distractions serve the specific purpose of taking the attention away from real problems caused by governments everywhere. But it\u2019s the numerous criminal conspiracies at work and shocking scandals that the elites seek to cover up by any means possible. You know it\u2019s a distraction when Drudge hypes it like this. There are relatively few military bioweaponry labs in the world that have the capability to create such a fatal and infectious virus. Thus, when the truth is confirmed about the Wuhan flu, there will be only a few culprits who are behind these assaults against the Chinese people. In reality, should this Wuhan coronavirus outbreak become a full-blown epidemic in China it could represent an attempt to commit genocide. Likewise, if it becomes a bona fide pandemic, it could ultimately be labeled a crime against humanity, perhaps even genocide. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation It\u2019s of paramount importance to understand that there really is a vast and highly organized New World Order conspiracy to foist a One World Government on the world community of nations. See: Is this Bill Gates\u2019 long-awaited excuse to usher in global governance? There are several main pillars of this New World Order agenda, one of which is being stealthily put into place by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Likewise, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg are slowly erecting one of the primary social media pillars as is Tony Dorsey at Twitter and Susan Wojcicki at YouTube. Bill and Hillary Clinton are using the Clinton Foundation to take advantage of poor countries around the world while surreptitiously laying the foundation for future exploitation on a mass scale just as George Soros & Sons are deceitfully creating new societies via geoengineered climate change, multiculturalism and cultural marxism. The crucial point is that all of these high-paid globalists are intimately connected to each other and covertly working to advance the same nation-destroying U.N. agendas. See: PEDOGATE : Epstein cofounded Clinton Global Initiative, Bill Gates hung out with Epstein AFTER conviction Fabricating global crises is at the very core of these various NWO sub-agendas. Two of the \u2018scariest\u2019 manufactured catastrophes are those that severely impact the biosphere (e.g. global warming) and undermine human health (e.g. deadly pandemics). In this way, false pretexts are being cunningly constructed to justify the establishment of an all-powerful One World Government . Toward that end, the NWO globalist cabal knows that they must first sufficiently manufacture consent so that the people demand a totalitarian form of global governance to manage these public health disasters and environmental catastrophes. Multi-billionaires such as Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Mark Zuckerberg and George Soros were all given their fortunes mostly through exorbitant corporate compensation plans, insider trading, currency manipulations, off-shore tax evasion schemes, and other forms of criminal unconscionable enrichment. Once they received those ill-gotten gains, they were completely own by the International Banking Cartel (IBC). The IBC then directs the expenditures of every single dollar given to these made tycoons, most of which are allocated toward carrying out the NWO implementation plan. The pet projects listed on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation website are examples of that nefarious plan. Of course, the whole world now knows that their pet project is their worldwide Super-Vaccination Agenda , where every single person is vaccinated every year, on time, and micro-chipped accordingly. What better way to completely control the global populace? See: India To Prosecute Bill Gates For Using Tribal Children To Conduct Illegal Vaccine Test There is no better way to enforce a mandatory global vaccination schedule than to engineer a frightening pandemic with an exceedingly high mortality rate. Billions of people will then demand the newly formulated vaccine necessary to protect them from such a fatal infection and/or debilitating disease. Hence, before anyone receives such a vaccine, it\u2019s important to know that the process REQUIRED to produce such an effective immunization is literally years from the making, if one is possible at all because of how intricately this coronavirus was bio-engineered to elude proper analysis and necessary experimentation. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite easy for any of the numerous U.S. military bioweapon labs to bioengineer a deadly super-virus and then release it in a city as large as Wuhan, China. Acts of bioterrorism like this are carried out all the time. As a matter of historical fact, the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 actually originated at Fort Riley, Kansas where soldiers reported to the Army\u2019s largest training facility during World War I. The soldiers who were [DELIBERATELY] infected with the H1N1 influenza virus then served as countless vectors of dissemination for the pandemic that ultimately killed as many as 100 million people worldwide. That single US-executed biowarfare operation against humanity was arguably the deadliest depopulation event in human history.\u201d (See: Spanish Flu of 1918 Was Really a Bioterror Attack on Humanity ) \u2014 Intelligence Analyst & Former U.S. Army Officer Conclusion There\u2019s no better way to compel a populace to comply with draconian vaccination regimens than to scare them with the prospect of a deadly pandemic. Governments around the world are constantly under pressure from the New World Order globalist cabal to implement the Super-Vaccination Agenda . Toward that end, the world community of nations has been repeatedly victimized by manufactured measles outbreaks and ever-worsening flu seasons, so they tell us. See: Annual Flu Shot Programs and Staged Measles Outbreaks Are the Central Pillars of the Super-Vaccination Agenda However, there really is much more to this story than meets the eye. Not only was the Wuhan coronavirus surreptitiously disseminated to serve as a major distraction from a rapidly collapsing Global Economic & Financial System , this state-sponsored black operation also represents the worst of predatory capitalism conducted as a means of generating revenue. Much more significantly, this staged pandemic will be cunningly used to exert oppressive international controls on travel as well as impose draconian medical measures which greatly advance the Super-Vaccination Agenda . Lastly, the timing of the deadly virus that ravaged China\u2019s pig farms last year quite predictably triggered a call for the development of a preventative vaccine. What the following news report neglected to state was that the mass slaughter of pigs, in a society that demands LOTS of pork, was cynically planned to manufacture the urgent need for yet another vaccine. See: China\u2019s Pig Farms Decimated by Virus\u2014Was it bioengineered and spread on purpose? The bottom line here is that the Wuhan coronavirus is likely another race-targeting bioweapon strategically unleashed throughout China by U.S. military labs Special Note: People, everything points to this bio-terror attack being the BIG ONE (also known as the global depopulation event we\u2019ve all been waiting for). This coronavirus is moving around the globe so fast, and being hyped by the Mainstream Media with such a vengeance, it\u2019s as though this will be their primary tool for total global lockdown. If the infection rate continues to proliferate into a full-blown pandemic, like The Powers That Be did with the Spanish flu, then this really is the depopulation event many of us have warned about. This highly misguided and naked act of bio-terrorism could even evolve into an ELE, God forbid. There\u2019s no question that 2020 promises to be a year of pervasive and profound transformation. The current state of affairs throughout the world community of nations cannot continue; it\u2019s far too unstable and explosive. Hence, it\u2019s quite likely that there will be a series of global catalysts that will prompt the necessary changes. While some of these apocalyptic calamities may seem terrifying at first, ultimately they will serve to contribute to the ongoing planetary catharsis. Whereas many folks will see all of these End-time crises as being intentionally manufactured by the power elite to save their own skins, REMEMBER, even the Dark Side can only act as the Highest Power permits. Also, that, ultimately, \u201call things work together toward good\u201d .

(See: Always obeying their NWO globalist masters, Australia swiftly develops coronavirus vaccine! ) As it was previously stated, the typical Hegelian Dialectic Problem~Reaction~Solution strategy will now be used to foist a toxic vaccination regimen on the entire planetary civilization. Update 2 The NWO globalist cabal knows that fastidiously bioengineered viruses, especially those which are hardwired to rapidly morph and mutate so as to elude an effective remedy, are the most effective depopulation weapons in their arsenal. See: The bioengineered Spanish flu that killed upwards of 100 MILLION people originated at Fort Riley, Kansas Update 3 Even popular Alt Media platforms are being used to float planted propaganda and false narratives \u2014 PREEMPTIVELY \u2014 in order to deflect any and all attention from this transparent bio-terror attack by the West. See this purposeful headline, which is usually issued by the CIA\u2019s Mockingbird Media , as an example of such a diversionary tactic and strategic misdirection: The Real Umbrella Corp: Wuhan Ultra Biohazard Lab Was Studying \u201cThe World\u2019s Most Dangerous Pathogens\u201d . Update 4 Fear-mongering headlines about China such as this one will only intensify until President Xi Jinping bends to the will of the Trump administration regarding the \u201ctrade deal from hell\u201d : China On Edge Of Chaos: \u201c7 Cities, 23 Million People Under Quarantine\u201d . Oh, and by the way, the headlines now read like this today: \u201cBeijing Calls In Military As Virus Overwhelms Wuhan Hospitals\u201d. Who, pray tell, will travel to China in 2020 in view of these swiftly deteriorating conditions?! Who will want to do business there? Exactly\u2014NO ONE. Which is exactly what the real perps wanted to achieve. Update 5 Will the utter panic being fueled by social media in China be used as a pretext to shut down vast swaths of the Internet? Both Big Tech and Big Social Media have been frenetically looking for ways to terminate the Alt Media . Here\u2019s what the ever-prevaricating New York Times featured today: Panic and Criticism Spread on Chinese Social Media Over Coronavirus . We\u2019re not saying it didn\u2019t happen; only that the Mainstream Media will do whatever is necessary to destroy the emerging Fifth Estate . See: Fifth Estate Looms Larger Than Ever as Alt Media Exposes NWO Agenda and Deep State Treason Update 6 There\u2019s an extremely malevolent aspect to this bio-terror operation: WEAPONIZED CORONAVIRUS : \u201cBioengineered as a self-replicating weapon system\u201d Update 7 Why didn\u2019t the U.S. implement the same type of border screenings as Russia and India? (See: Deadly Chinese coronavirus arrives in US as Russia, India & others boost border screenings ) The southern border, especially in California, is so porous and vulnerable to illegal aliens with deadly contagious diseases crossing over that any enemy could send infected Trojan horses into the Southwest all day long. Update 8 The United States Government is already notorious for recklessly releasing dangerous infection agents and contagious viruses into the national environment, as well as in foreign countries. One of the worst of these bio-terror operations unleashed in the 50 states concerns the multi-decade epidemic known as Lyme disease . For the unaware, the following video expos\u00e9 spells it out in graphic detail: The Officially Ignored Link Between Bioengineered Lyme Disease and the Plum Island Bioweapon Laboratory Update 9 As suspected, the NWO perps are taking this bioengineered pandemic global very, VERY quickly. The United States now has 3 confirmed cases and 63 suspected ones.

While there may be aspects and details that are proven to be fake, that does not mean the entire psyop / black op is a hoax. As the perps often do, they blend grim realities with obvious falsehoods in order to confuse investigative journalists who then promote their own fictitious narrative. This tendency must be resisted until we see how this factually evolves. See: It\u2019s way too early for the Alt Media to call this developing pandemic a hoax . Update 13 And along comes a PhD Toxicologist who really knows what he\u2019s talking about regarding this particular coronavirus. Despite a degree from Duke University\u2019s Department of Pathology, this trained scientist has left the reservation of political correctness and breaks it all down in this informative video: Coronavirus Is Worse Than You\u2019ve Been Told . Update 14 Every bioengineered pandemic, especially those that have gone unidentified and/or unacknowledged, have a specific purpose for the targeted populations and bloodlines. Whereas the Spanish flu was as a full-scale depopulation event, the Epstein-Barr virus released during the 1960s was a stealthy bio-terror attack with a highly hidden agenda. The rebellious Beatniks and Baby Boomers were the explicit target of the EBV stealth virus as their health has greatly suffered since those original bouts of Mononucleosis. Likewise, everything now points to the great likelihood that the present act of bio-terrorism in China was conducted to expose as many people as possible in order to degrade the overall health profiles and undermine the immune systems of the susceptible populations. This is why the Chinese bloodlines were specifically targeted; they have been set up to suffer a similar fate as those who still suffer from EBV Stage IV some 50 years after that bio-crime. This analysis certainly does not preclude the distinct possibility that the Wuhan bio-attack could end up morphing into a major depop event. Only time will tell. Update 15 An essential revisiting of the Spanish flu genocide reveals that it was the prescribed aspirin which turned that influenza into such a mass killer. Therefore, it\u2019s imperative that every person who contracts Wuhan coronavirus understands their treatment plan and is not taking any medicine(s) that can worsen it. Certain drug interactions, in particular, can significantly increase the severity of certain types of flu and their various symptoms. See: BEWARE: Spanish Flu Mortality Rate Soared Because of Doctor-prescribed Medicines Especially Aspirin Update 16 \u2018The Father of the Coronavirus Virus is the CDC\u2019, Brought to China by the C.I.A. Update 17 What\u2019s vital to correctly comprehend throughout this unfolding global drama is that there are multiple scenarios developing in different parts of the world as various covert schemes are being executed by the perpetrators. None of these scenarios are necessarily mutually exclusive. While some of them described in these updates may even appear to contradict each other, they can all be true and/or operative at the same time. For instance, it has been reported that Man Who Pushed SARS Dud Now Pushing New Chinese Virus . That factoid might lead many to believe that the current outbreak is a media-generated hoax, when in reality it could be much worse than what is represented by the MSM. In other words, this complex conspiracy was made quite complicated and confusing on purpose to confound both medical researchers and scientific investigators alike. Update 18 What makes Wuhan coronavirus so challenging to closely monitor and potentially decimating is this: Coronavirus Stealth Strain Bioengineered to Avoid Detection in Carriers Who Present No Symptoms The U.S. military labs have been hard at work over decades perfecting their newfangled bioweapons. What that means is that a previous pandemic \u2014 known or silent \u2014 is craftily utilized to lay the foundation for a future one that, when overlaid, triggers a whole new multi-infection syndrome which is both deadly and difficult to identify, much less treat successfully. There are also multiple chemtrail aerosol formulations that are used to activate different flu pathogens that line the respiratory tract. That\u2019s why so many now complain of both Chemtrail Flu and Chemtrail Syndrome . See: CHEMTRAIL SYNDROME: A Global Pandemic Of Epic Proportions Update 19 Now we know: Why are these 80 scientists now dead? And, why are they all microbiologists?

        "content": "2019-nCoV | Face mask stocks sufficient, more arriving on February 2 \nThe local health authorities have informed that the current stock of surgical face masks acquired by the government is sufficient for the next 10 days and that a restock will be received from a delivery due on February 2. This information was disseminated by the Health Bureau (SSM) director during the press conference held yesterday to provide an update on the status of the coronavirus locally and publicize new measures by the government in response to it. The government has ordered 20 million face masks of which approximately 13 million have arrived in the past few days and been distributed to the population through normal channels. To help the distribution of masks during the first days of the new Lunar Year, the government also enforced a new measure on January 24, lasting until today, that adds the sales of masks at seven public health care centres in addition to the 56 contracted pharmacies across Macau. From January 30, face masks will continue to be sold in batches of 10 to all people presenting a valid Macau ID card or a non-resident worker\u2019s card (commonly referred to as a blue card) at pharmacies for the price of 8 patacas. According to SSM information, it is believed that the arrival of masks can alleviate the registered rise in market demand for masks which resulted in stock rupture and significant price hikes. The bureau said, \u201cresidents do not need to panic or rush to pharmacies for purchasing,\u201d adding also that the quality of the masks being sold at the local pharmacies has been certified to \u201censure that the masks available to the public meet the quality assurance standards.\u201d Questioned by the media about complaints from residents regarding a lack of quality of some of the masks on sale, SSM Director Lei Chin Ion reaffirmed that the bureau can only be responsible for the products acquired by the government in a collaboration between the SSM, the Economic Bureau, and the Consumer Council which are being sold at approved pharmacies and health care centers. The official noted that there are many other products on sale in different establishments for which the SSM cannot guarantee the origin and quality standards. The SSM also reminds residents to observe respiratory etiquette by avoiding covering the nose and mouth with hands when coughing or sneezing, and to instead use their elbow or upper sleeve if no tissue is available. Earlier in the week, the health authorities advised all people to use face masks when entering a place with a high concentration of people, especially when using public transportation. Previously, the health authority said that that the public did not need to wear masks all the time. Rather, wearing a mask was recommended only when visiting medical facilities or institutions, and in circumstances where the mask-wearer has respiratory symptoms or a fever.",

        "content": "Barber shops, nail salons, gyms and a few other businesses reopened in Georgia on Friday as the Republican governor eased a month-long shutdown despite warnings from health experts of a potential new surge of coronavirus infections.\nAs some customers ventured back to these venues, the confirmed number of coronavirus deaths in the United States passed 50,000, according to a tally compiled by John Hopkins University from government figures.\nEven though limited in scope, the reopenings in Georgia and at least two other states marked a symbolic milestone in the debate raging the United States \u2013 and the world -- as to how quickly political leaders should lift economically damaging lockdown orders.\nWith deaths and infections still rising in Georgia, many business owners planned to remain closed in spite of Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s assurance that hospital visits and new cases have leveled off enough for barbers, tattoo artists, massage therapists and personal trainers to return to work with restrictions.\nKemp\u2019s timeline to restart the economy proved too ambitious even for President DonaldTrump, who said Wednesday he \u201cdisagreed strongly\u201d with the fellow Republican\u2019s plan.\nWithout a tried-and-tested action plan for how to pull countries out of coronavirus lockdown, the world is seeing a patchwork of approaches. Schools reopen in one country, stay closed in others; face masks are an obligation here, a simple recommendation there.\nKids still attend soccer practice in Sweden while they are not even allowed outside in Spain. In the U.S. state of Georgia, gyms, hair salons and bowling alleys were being allowed to reopen Friday even as American hospitals still heave with virus emergencies. In other parts of the globe, the prospect of a haircut is still weeks away.\nThere is no simple, one-size-fits-all answer. As governments and scientists fumble around, still struggling with so many unknowns, individuals are being left to take potentially life-affecting decisions.\nIn France, for instance, the government is leaving families to decide whether to keep children at home or send them back to class when the nationwide lockdown, in place since March 17, starts to be eased May 11.\nIn Spain, parents face a similarly knotty decision: whether to let kids get their first fresh air in weeks when the country starts Sunday to ease the total ban on letting them outside. Even then, they will still have to abide by a \u201c1-1-1\u201d rule: no more than one hour per day, within a few minutes walk of their house and with no more than one supervising adult.\n\u201cThe first day is going to be stressful,\u201d said Eva Novillo, who has been confined with her wife and 7-year-old Ema in Madrid for more than five weeks. \u201cWe are going to be hysterical for the kids not to touch anything or not to touch their faces.\u201d\nThe slowing of Spain\u2019s horrific outbreak, which has killed more than 22,500 people, made the prospect of letting kids out feasible. For the first time Friday, Spanish health authorities counted more people recovering from the disease in a 24-hour span than new infections.\nThe imperative to reopen is largely driven by economics, with lockdowns bleeding companies and government coffers of cash. In a trend seen around the globe, roughly 26 million Americans have filed for jobless aid in five weeks, pushing unemployment to levels last seen during the Great Depression of the 1930s and raising the stakes over how and when to ease shutdowns of factories and other businesses.\nShutdown hotels, restaurants, bars and cafes in Germany placed empty chairs in streets and squares Friday to highlight their economic suffering. The prospect of sipping wine on a Paris sidewalk also is still far off: French authorities announced that restaurants, bars and cafes won\u2019t reopen before June.\nFor many of the world\u2019s poor, without social safety nets, idling at home or home-schooling kids with online classes are luxuries beyond reach.\nEven in the world\u2019s wealthiest countries, reopening too much, too fast raises the possibility of new infection spikes that again overwhelm hospital ICUs.\nJapan initially seemed to have controlled its outbreak by going after clusters of infections. But on Friday, Japanese medical experts issued a stark warning that the country\u2019s emergency medicine resources are reaching breaking point amid dire equipment shortages.\nThe coronavirus has killed more than 190,000 people worldwide, including more than 100,000 in Europe and nearly 50,000 in the United States, according to a tally compiled by John Hopkins University from government figures. The true numbers are undoubtedly far higher, and new cases are surging in Africa and Latin America as outbreaks subside in some places that were hit earlier.\nIn Muslim communities, the pandemic is casting a shadow over the holy month of Ramadan \u2014 marked by daytime fasting, overnight festivities and communal prayer. Ramadan begins for the world\u2019s 1.8 billion Muslims with this week\u2019s new moon. Many Muslim leaders have closed mosques or banned collective evening prayer to ward off infections.\nSome U.S. governors have begun loosening up despite warnings from health authorities that it may be too soon to do so without sparking the second wave of infections.\nA major meatpacking plant in northern Colorado that closed because of an outbreak that killed four workers was set to reopen Friday after two-week disinfection, even as some questioned how employees can maintain social distancing inside the facility.\nOn the economic front, few experts foresee a downturn as severe as the Great Depression, when unemployment remained above 14% from 1931 to 1940, peaking at 25%. But unemployment is considered likely to remain elevated well into next year and probably beyond, and will surely top the 10% peak of the 2008-09 recession.\nU.S. President Donald Trump will be holding a signing ceremony Friday for a bill providing a nearly $500 billion infusion of coronavirus spending, rushing new relief to employers and hospitals.

In addition, enVision only requires a very small amount of sample and can work at room temperature and does not require heaters or special pumps, making it very portable.\nIn 2018, Assistant Professor Shao and her team developed patented DNA molecular machines that can recognize genetic material of different diseases and perform different functions. These molecular machines form the backbone of the enVision platform.\nThe novel platform adopts a \u2018plug-and-play\u2019 modular design and uses microfluidic technology to reduce the amount of samples and biochemical reagents required as well as to optimize the technology\u2019s sensitivity for visual readouts.\nTIMELINE FOR DEVELOPMENT\nAccording to a TV interview with MediaCorp Channel 8 in Singapore, Assistant Professor Shao said that the first phase of development and testing will be done using man-made samples, which can be done within a few weeks. The subsequent phase will require actual human samples, which will be more complicated as real human blood and saliva samples contain other compounds.\nThe research team estimates that the new Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) detection kit will take a few months before hitting the market. According to the Ministry of Health, such detection kits must be approved by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) before it is made commercially available. ",

The new Corona-free districts are Durg, Rajnandgaon from Chhattisgarh and Shivpuri from Madhya Pradesh.\nAccording to the ministry officials, the virus outbreak is under control in the country and with the help of a robust surveillance network, a total of 9.45 lakh people are under the surveillance.\nWhile addressing a press briefing, chairman of Empowered Group-1 and Niti Aayog member V K Paul said: \"The lockdown has been effective in slowing the rate at which COVID-19 cases is doubling in India, and it now stands at 10 days.\"\nPaul also made it clear that the data or analysis of cases provided by the government is true and the chances of reconsolidation are negligible.\n\"If we go back to March 21, the cases were doubling in around three days. An important turn came on March 23 after the &apos;Janata Curfew&apos;. The direction changed and the doubling rate increased to five. By then, we had already put in place travel restrictions and had created an environment of social distancing,\" Paul said.\n\"There were some disturbances in between and we went back a little. But from April 6, the doubling time started improving,\" he said, adding that the nationwide lockdown has \"proved to be very timely and beneficial\".\n\"The curve has begun to flatten. Had we not taken the decision of clamping the nationwide lockdown, we would have had around 1 lakh COVID-19 cases by now, as per a reasonable estimate. Now, the outbreak is under control,\" Paul said, adding that these projections are based on the growth pattern at a particular time.\nDirector of National Centre for Disease Control S K Singh said surveillance has been the country&apos;s primary weapon.\nAs on Friday, India conducted 5,41,789 tests. There are at least 272 testing labs in the government network and 87 private labs to conduct the COVID-19 tests.\nMeanwhile, the Centre on Friday said the COVID-19 situation is especially serious in major or emerging hotspot areas including Ahmedabad, Surat, Hyderabad and Chennai.\nFour new interministerial teams have been sent to monitor the COVID-19 situation in Gujarat, Telangana and Tamil Nadu, officials said on Friday.\n\"The situation is especially serious in major hotspot districts or emerging hotspots like Ahmedabad and Surat (Gujarat), Thane (Maharashtra), Hyderabad (Telangana), and Chennai (Tamil Nadu),\" the statement said.\n",

        "content": "Definaction and Some tips to stay from Corona viruses Corona viruses In the very simple word it can be said that, Coronaviruses viruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, the viruses cause respiratory infections which are typically mild, including the common cold and the novel coronavirus causing the current outbreak can be lethal. In cows and pigs they may cause diarrhea, while in chickens they can cause an upper respiratory disease. There are no vaccines or antiviral drugs that are approved for prevention or treatment. The death toll from a coronavirus outbreak in China passed 490 on Wednesday(5/12/2020). Across mainland China, there were 3,887 new confirmed infections, bringing the total accumulated number to 24,324. The name \"coronavirus\" is derived from the Latin corona, meaning crown or halo, which refers to the characteristic appearance of the virus particles (virions): they have a fringe reminiscent of a royal crown or of the solar corona. Apart from human beings, coronaviruses can affect mammals including pigs, cattle, cats, dogs, martens, camels, hedgehogs and some birds.So far, there are four known disease-causing coronaviruses ses, among which the best known are the SARS corona virus and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, both of which can cause severe respiratory diseases. SOME TIPS TO STAY SAFE FROM CORONAVIRUS - 1. Wear gloves before you leave home and keep them on in public spaces. 2. If you have to remove your gloves in a social situation, do not touch your face or eyes afterwards. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water before you put your gloves back on. 3. Wash your gloves daily and avoid wearing damp gloves. 4. Put on a mask before leaving home and avoid using the same mask daily. Stay away from crowds and keep distance from individual people. 5. Do not shake hands or hug people. 6. Replace old bathroom and kitchen towels with clean towels and instruct everybody in your home to use their own towels. Regularly wash all towels and make sure to keep them dry. 7. Be mindful of not touching your face and wash your hands immediately after touching any object intended for public use. 8. Do not share spoons or cups. Wash all food and kitchenware thoroughly between meals and avoid restaurants that have poor hygiene practices. 9. Do not buy, slaughter, or consume any live animal or fish until it is known what species was the source of the virus.",

The question is, how to better protect our selves and our loved ones from possible infection? The answer or I should say part of the solution is in washing hands often, The CDC recommends washing hands often in order to reduce the risk of infection. Think about how many things we touch in a single day. The gas pump and the credit card machines, the elevator buttons, all of the buttons at the self checkout at the grocery store. The grocery cart, door handles, faucets, our cell phones, computer keys, handles, money, we touch and handle things in the store all the time. The list goes on and on and we don't even think about the fact that infection is easily spread this way.Chaplain Paul was also quoted saying, If you or someone in your family is dealing with the flu then it wouldn't hurt to have that person wear a surgical mask and gloves. This helps to reduce the spread of infection in hospitals. If you or some one in your family works in a nursing home or hospital setting then have them remove their shoes when they return home. Use bleach wipes to disinfect shoes. Wipe down all can goods, bottles and containers before bringing them into your home.Chaplain Paul was also quoted saying, wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands often, as a Community Chaplain I see all to often how easy infection spreads in a hospital setting. Remember try not to cough or sneeze into your hands, stay home if you are sick. Do not visit anyone in a hospital or nursing home setting if you are sick or even have a cold. Above all pray for God's guidance, protection and love in these matters and remember what proverbs 3:5-6 teaches, Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your paths.",

        "content": "A week ago, we published details that raised questions about the source of the Wuhan novel coronavirus, specifically questioning the official theory for the spread of the Coronavirus epidemic, namely because someone ate bat soup at a Wuhan seafood and animal market as a fabricated farce.\nThe real reason behind the viral spread, we suggested, was that a weaponized version of the coronavirus (one which may have originally been obtained from Canada ) , was released by Wuhan's Institute of Virology (presumably accidentally ) , China's only top, level-4 biohazard lab, which was studying \" the world's most dangerous pathogens .\"\nAt the time we summarized the series of dots and asked \"real reporters\" to connect them: One of China's top virology and immunology experts was and still works at China's top-rated biohazard lab, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which some have affectionately called the real Umbrella Corp . Since 2009, Peng has been the leading Chinese scientist researching the immune mechanism of bats carrying and transmitting lethal viruses in the world. His primary field of study is researching how and why bats can be infected with some of the most nightmarish viruses in the world including Ebola, SARS and Coronavirus, and not get sick. He was genetically engineering various immune pathways ( such as the STING pathway in bats ) to make the bats more or less susceptible to infection, in the process potentially creating a highly resistant mutant superbug. As part of his studies, Peng also researched mutant Coronavirus strains that overcame the natural immunity of some bats; these are \"superbug\" Coronavirus strains, which are resistant to any natural immune pathway, and now appear to be out in the wild. As of mid-November, his lab was actively hiring inexperienced post-docs to help conduct his research into super-Coronaviruses and bat infections. Peng's work on virology and bat immunology has received support from the National \"You Qing\" Fund, the pilot project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the major project of the Ministry of Science and Technology.\nOf course, that is all ancient history and Zero Hedge was permanently banned from Twitter for raising such a conspiracy theory about a publicly-searchable person working a publicly-searchable place.\nBut, bygones being bygones, we moved on... until today when no lesser entity than The White House began asking questions about the origin of the deadly coronavirus.\nAs ABC News reports, the director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in a letter to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, requested that scientific experts \"rapidly\" look into the origins of the virus in order to address both the current spread and \"to inform future outbreak preparation and better understand animal/human and environmental transmission aspects of coronaviruses.\"\nSpecifically, ABC News' Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton asked the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease about concerns that stem from misinformation online that the novel coronavirus could have been engineered or deliberately released .\n\"There's always that concern ,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci said.\n\"And one of the things that people are doing right now is very carefully looking at sequences to see if there's even any possibility much less likelihood that that's going on . And you could ultimately determine that. So people are looking at it, but right now, the focus is on what are we going to do about what we have.\"\nThe White House has good reason to question the official story as evolutionary biologist Dr. James Lyons-Weiler of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge , showed and explained how the coronavirus' genetic sequence - which has been publicly released by China - contains a unique \"middle fragment\" encoding a SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) spike protein that appears, according to his genomic analysis, to have been inserted into the 2019-nCoV virus using \"pShuttle\" technology. This technique can only be done in a lab, as it has never occurred naturally in nature.\n\u201cThis isn't a 'conspiracy theory', it is a scientific, medical theory,\u201d says Del Bigtree, the Emmy-winning producer and founder of non-profit Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN).\n\u201cIts foundation is based on sound science, logic, and research, and the mainstream media needs to be asked whether it is going to pursue this link to SARS instead of trying to censor anyone who is trying to pursue truth via scientific fact .\u201d\nOne additional, major reason we suspect this line of logical reasoning could be correct - as conspiratorial as it may seem - is that Chinese authorities have launched a full-scale crusade to disprove the fact that this deadly virus was man-made.\n\"Conspiracy theorists don't believe in science. I hope that the national professional department will investigate and give us an innocence,\" Shi Zhengli, a director at the Wuhan Institute of Virology - the only P4 level biosafety laboratory in China - responded to Caixin on February 4.\nFaced with external doubts and accusations, on February 2nd, Shi Zhengli responded angrily in the WeChat circle of friends:\n\" The new coronavirus in 2019 is a punishment for uncivilized living habits of human beings by nature . It doesn't matter. I advise those who believe and spread rumours of bad media, believe in the so-called academic analysis that Indian scholars do not rely on, and close your mouth. \"\nAdditionally, as The Washington Times reports, one ominous sign, said a U.S. official, is the that false rumors since the outbreak began several weeks ago have begun circulating on the Chinese Internet claiming the virus is part of a U.S. conspiracy to spread germ weapons.\nThat could indicate China is preparing propaganda outlets to counter future charges the new virus escaped from one of Wuhan\u2019s civilian or defense research laboratories .\nAs a reminder, it was discovered that Shi Zhengli had participated in a study published in Natural Medicine on November 9, 2015, about a disease that can be caused by a SARS-like coronavirus (SHC014-CoV) found in Chinese horseshoe bats .\nThe researchers used the SARS reverse genetics system to generate and identify a chimeric virus. In simple terms, this chimeric virus consists of the surface protein of SHC014 and the backbone of the SARS virus. The chimeric virus can infect human respiratory cells, demonstrating that the surface protein of SHC014 has the necessary structure to bind to key receptors on cells and infect cells. Chimeras can cause disease in mice, but they are not lethal. Studies have shown that viruses currently circulating in bat populations could potentially trigger the potential risk of SARS-CoV (SARS virus) outbreaks .\nWe are sure this is all just a coincidence - Wuhan epicenter... Only P4 facility in China... A lab investigating bats infected with genetically engineered Coronavirus... Coronavirus infected Bats... Chimeric bio-engineered viruses.... and that is probably why The White House is now asking authorities to investigate the source of the disease.\nOf course, when Zero Hedge suggested the same thing, highlighting key personnel in the Wuhan lab that were publicly acknowledged as responsible for that research, we were immediately banned by Twitter. We look forward to reading Buzzfeed's article decrying The White House for daring to ask questions about the origin of this deadly pandemic.\n* * *\nCorrection: After publishing this article, we were contacted by Dr. Lyons-Weiler who requested that we strike through the terms expert virologist. He also would like to emphasize that he stated a hypothesis, has not stated 100% certainty about the origin of this virus and that analyses are ongoing. ",

Sky Today, we learn that a prison in the United Kingdom is experiencing an outbreak of the coronavirus after a prisoner was brought over from Thailand two weeks ago.\nAccording to Thai authorities , there are only 33 people infected in the nation of 69 million souls, meaning that the individual extradited from Thailand won the coronavirus lottery.\nIt is highly unlikely that Mr. Rumble, the prisoner extradited to the UK, could have come into contact with an infected person if indeed there are only 33 cases in Thailand.\nThe Thai government is clearly lying, and so are UK authorities. Mr. Rumble's extradition was planned, and the objective is to sow fear in the population of Scotland and Northern Ireland, to prevent the end of the Union and the re-ignition of The Troubles.\nIf the Scottish people are to vote to break off from Westminster, they would only do so in the hopes of rejoining the European Union, an extremely unlikely event if the people can be made to fear open borders.\nThe fact that the Wuhan coronavirus is now in a prison in the UK means that this virus can no longer be contained, it can only be mitigated.\nWhen British bodies start dropping on the streets, that's when the people will forget Brexit and think of nothing but the danger that foreigners pose to their lives.

Frazier\u2019s life story would have delighted Abraham Lincoln, who was always thrilled when people from humble backgrounds achieved success through grit and determination. As a youngster, Frazier was fired up to do well and to do good by Thurgood Marshall, the great civil rights lawyer who won the landmark case before the Supreme Court that ended legal school segregation, and by his own father, who raised him and his siblings to work hard, aim high, maintain one\u2019s integrity and, especially, prize education. Thanks to the civil rights movement, Frazier had opportunities that hadn\u2019t been available to his father, who, Frazier points out, would also have been a CEO were it not for racial barriers.\nSpecial Guest \u2013 Jon Rappoport!

I can\u2019t recapitulate all the relevant findings every time I write a new piece. This article is a kind of summary of where I stand, at this moment. A rather crowded snapshot. Judging from the history of epidemics that turned out to be duds\u2014West Nile, bird flu, SARS, Swine Flu, and so on\u2014and judging from my research on these frauds\u2014I see no reason to jump the gun and say, \u201cThis one is different.\u201d Every time one of these threatening clouds passes across the sun, all sorts of people in both the mainstream and alternative press make dire predictions, ranging from \u201cthis looks like a global pandemic,\u201d to \u201cthe virus is a bio-weapon and will kill millions,\u201d to the ever-popular, \u201cthis is THE BIG ONE.\u201d And then, when the dust clears, and the dud is exposed, amnesia about having made those predictions sets in.\nHow the new coronavirus will finally get a proper name It has infected thousands of people, closed borders and put parts of China into lockdown. But the virus causing the outbreak of illness does not yet have a proper name. It has been referred to as the coronavirus. But that is the name of the group of viruses it belongs to. It has also been given the temporary title 2019-nCoV. But just saying that is a mouthful. A group of scientists has been grappling behind closed doors to find a proper term. Now they have told the BBC they are close to announcing it. So why has it taken so long? \u201cThe naming of a new virus is often quite delayed and the focus until now has been on the public health response, which is understandable,\u201d says Crystal Watson, senior scholar and assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \u201cBut there are reasons the naming should be a priority.\u201d\nHour 2 \u2013 Outside The Box With Ty Bollinger! It\u2019s time to go Outside The Box again with Ty Bollinger! What will we be talking about today? National Health Emergency Declared Today (Friday, Jan. 31, 2020), President Trump declared that the novel coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the United States. Also yesterday, under the guidance of the CDC, the White House Coronavirus Task Force announced a 14-day quarantine for Americans who recently visited Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. This will begin at 5pm ET tomorrow (Sunday). The 195 evacuated Americans (including a group of U.S. government workers and private citizens) will remain at a military base in Southern California until mid-February. The U.S. government has not issued a quarantine like this in over 50 years. On Thursday, the W.H.O. declared that the coronavirus is a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern\u201d (PHEIC). India has reported its first case . Russia has closed part of its border with China, and more than 7,700 cases have been reported, with 170 deaths.

The government\u2019s chief information officer, Victor Lam, unveiled the e-tag at a press briefing this afternoon, saying that any Hong Kong residents who have been to Hubei in the past 14 days must undergo home quarantine of 14 days, a measure the new electronic bracelets are meant to ensure. The tag is paired to a person\u2019s smartphone \u2014 using Bluetooth Low Energy, or BLE, technology \u2014 and is plugged into the mains at the wearer\u2019s home.\nFears thick \u2018death\u2019 smog over Wuhan confirms China is burning coronavirus bodies Eerie footage of Wuhan engulfed in a thick fog has fuelled concerns the death toll inside coronavirus -hit China is \u201chigher\u201d than what\u2019s been officially reported. Clips appear to show the city in a mysterious haze which residents say has \u201ccome out of nowhere\u201d. The videos have led to concerns that the smog is the result of smoke from crematoriums burning coronavirus-infected bodies \u201c24 hours a day\u201d. It comes a day after the National Health Commission in China ordered all coronavirus fatalities to be cremated, with burials and funerals banned, to prevent to spread of disease. Chinese nationals voiced their concerns on social media, suggesting the death toll could be \u201cunthinkably higher\u201d than reports if incinerators are running all day. Wuhan, like many Chinese cities, has a high pollution rate and there is no hard evidence to confirm that the smog is anything to do with bodies being burned. However, that hasn\u2019t stopped people speculating about the increased pollution, with one Twitter user writing: \u201cIncinerators are running 24 hours a day.\nGun owners aren\u2019t happier, don\u2019t sleep better at night Despite claims that owning a gun makes a person feel safer and sleep easier, gun owners don\u2019t actually sleep any better than non-gun owners, according to a new study by University of Arizona researcher Terrence Hill. Gun owners also aren\u2019t any happier than those who don\u2019t own guns, Hill found in a second study. That\u2019s surprising, he says, given that gun owners often say that their guns make them feel safe, secure and protected, and those feelings are generally associated with happiness . The findings help researchers better understand the relationship between gun ownership and personal well-being, an area where research is currently lacking, said Hill, an associate professor of sociology in the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences. \u201cWe want to understand gun owners\u2019 subjective experiences,\u201d Hill said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand when guns promote individual well-being, if at all, and that will add to the discussion of the role of guns in our society.\u201d\nPopular Diet Pill Linked to Cancer Last week, the FDA issued a warning that the weight loss drug lorcaserin hydrochloride (sold under the brand name Belviq) was associated with an increased risk of cancer. The drug was designed to increase feelings of fullness. While the studies are ongoing, the initial data suggests a connection between the diet pill and cancer. Researchers don\u2019t yet know the mechanism and can\u2019t say definitively whether there is correlation or causation, but one thing is clear: people taking the weight loss drug are more likely to develop cancer. The research is just recently underway, even though the drug was approved by the FDA way back in 2012. The decision was a relatively controversial one, given that lorcaserin only showed a 3.3% improvement over the placebo group. There was also concern that lorcaserin could cause heart valve issues, but there was not enough data done to prove it one way or the other. Still, the FDA\u2019s Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee voted 18-4 \u2013 with one abstention \u2013 in favor of approving the drug. It was also not the first time that lorcaserin has been before an FDA review panel.\nRemember Friends, The Power to Heal is Yours!

Representatives from the Israeli emergency medical services\u2019 organization Magen David Adom pack boxes of protective gear, responding to a request by Chabad to help communities in China amid the coronavirus outbreak, February 2020. Credit: Courtesy.\nAt a press conference in Tel Aviv on Sunday, Dai Yuming said that he felt \u201cbad and sad\u201d over the \u201cerrors to limit or even ban entries of Chinese citizens\u201d into Israel \u201cbecause it actually recalled me the old days, the old stories that happened in World War II, the Holocaust. Many Jewish were refused when they tried to seek assistance. Only very, very few countries opened their doors. One of them is China. I hope Israel will never close their door to the Chinese. In the darkest days of the Jewish people, we didn\u2019t close the door on them. I hope Israel will not close the door on the Chinese.\u201d\nDai\u2019s comments could not have been more outrageous.\nThe outcry that they unleashed in the press and on social media spurred the Chinese embassy in Israel to express regret. In a statement issued to the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Beijing\u2019s diplomatic mission basically claimed that its representative\u2019s words had been misconstrued.\n\u201c[W]e would like to clarify that there was no intention whatsoever to compare the dark days of the Holocaust with the current situation and the efforts taken by the Israeli government to protect its citizens,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe would like to apologize if someone understood our message the wrong way.\u201d\nReally. As though it would have been possible to interpret it as anything but what it was: an accusation that Israel was turning its back on victimized men, women and children under threat of annihilation in their country of origin, and a plea for the Jewish state and its citizens to remember how that particular type of rejection felt during World War II.\nThe chutzpah is startling, though not surprising, given the regime that Dai serves. You know, the one that commits Nazi-like atrocities against members of its society with impunity\u2014and without batting an eyelash. Ruthie Blum/JNS\nThese barbaric acts include the holding of more than 1 million Muslims in concentration camps, where they are subjected to torture, forced organ removal and abortions , among other medical \u201cexperiments.\u201d\nTalk about the wok calling the kettle black.\nIndeed, on the one hand, Dai was engaging in the all-too-common practice of singling out Israel for condemnation while the rest of the world\u2019s countries, particularly his own, not only have been scrambling to contain the deadly virus, but are adopting policies to keep it from continuing to permeate borders. On the other, he was being a loyal Communist diplomat, spewing strategic propaganda with a purpose, part of which is to deflect from some inconvenient truths.\nAmong these is Beijing\u2019s desperate attempt to downplay the number of its citizens who have contracted the virus and lie about the death toll. This is clear from the way in which huge swaths of the population are forbidden from leaving their homes without face masks\u2014which have all but run out due to the demand that outweighs the supply\u2014and arrested violently by police if they fail to do so.\nIn stark contrast, Israel is trying to be both proactive and productive. Where the former is concerned, Chinese citizens landing at Ben-Gurion International Airport are sent back home (or elsewhere), and Israelis returning from China are required to remain under self-imposed house quarantine for two weeks.\nAs for the latter: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has tasked Israel\u2019s Institute for Biological Research and Health Ministry with developing a vaccine for the coronavirus. Of course.\nMeanwhile, at the request of Chabad in China, Magen David Adom \u2014Israel\u2019s national emergency and ambulance service\u2014sent 2,000 face masks and 200 full-body protection kits to the People\u2019s Republic. Natch.\nDai, his embassy staff and the regime in Beijing should be bowing to Israel, not pretending to rue outlandish remarks about the Holocaust.",

He said that NIAID is working on a vaccine, although it will take about three months until they can begin testing it in humans.\n\u201cWe just have to make sure we are fully prepared [since] Infectious diseases will continue to arise in the human species. And we have to be essentially perpetually prepared. \u201c\nIt is still unclear how long the virus will be active in China, where so far more than 30 million people in the Wuhan, China area have been in quarantine.\nSaturday was reported that the United States government is preparing a charter flight this weekend to evacuate US citizens and diplomats from Wuhan.\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced on Saturday that it will move a qualifying event from Wuhan, China, to Amman, Jordan, for concerns about the outbreak.\nJohn Catsimatidis is an investor in The Hill.",

More than 10,000 people have been infected in the past two months and, of those, at least 213 have died (as of the end of the day on Friday)[1]. All in all, a pretty big impact for a pretty tiny virus. Speculation regarding the longterm economic impacts of the Wuhan coronavirus continues apace with experts predicting potentially significant and lasting damage to (at least) China\u2019s economy. The availability of instantly available information\u2014a stream of \u201cdata\u201d addressing the spread of the virus, new cases, speculation on modes of transmission, efforts to contain it\u2014has likely magnified its impact materially. On the positive side, that information is absolutely critical to public health officials efforts to track and contain the spread of the virus. At the same time, the easily available but not-always-reliable information stream has exacerbated the response and the panic surrounding spread and risk of infection. Interestingly, while the virus is a cousin of the SARS virus, and while there is a world of information available regarding the spread, containment and trajectory of SARS, little or none of that real data seems to be filtering into either public or market response. The evident impact that the Wuhan virus is having foreshadows greater risk to world stability arising from other more and less deadly viruses in the future. As the human population expands, it will undoubtedly encounter new viruses and will have to address the risk of exposure and illness in a thoughtful and more targeted fashion. It seems unlikely that humans can rely on that these exposures will obtain on a once every decade and a half time frame. ~~ David M Walsh 1: Veiga, Alex. \u201cStocks sink on fears virus outbreak will dent global economy.\u201d The Seattle Times (Seattle) 31 January 2020.

Multi cellular body cells will only divide in this way, if they have a non native inflated cell structure.Both bacterial and viral infections turn on the enzymes to make sells inflated. Viruses then copy their own genome, bacteria are copied by the over helpful you an immune system, and given a minimal cell wall.As I told Sheffield University 2001, ultrasound sets off nuclear fusion in liquid water. 1H2O+US->He2++O++3e-+E2With inflated cells in the human body, external application of high intensity ultrasound will cause the cell to experience molecular nuclear fusion. 2H2O+P+HIUS->He+O+E2Every registered Dr. In the world had to acquire a HIUS device, an validate the new medicine. It was a physical cure to all viruses and cancers out there.Doctors who did not validate the new medicine, ceased to V registered doctors on their first prescription of the defective cancer and viral drugs from the 20th century.With MS are was outbreak of 2003, I sent the idea of giving an immune drip of interleukin 2 and 4, to infected patients.

Doctors protest, totally incorrectly, that they can not cure viruses.Year each and every registered Dr. on earth has a validated that HIUS clears cancers and viruses.

Yet somehow 2020, drug company is will suddenly announce a new or bacterial epidemic. Probably in Asia again!That HIUS clears all viral and bacterial infections. Prescribing biochemical drugs to Corona are infected patients, is fatal medical malpractice.Striking off the Dr., and support staff. Who will then all undergo criminal trial for first degree medical murder. And obviously be struck off from all medical activity for life.Dangerous murderers. Not health givers! So Corona is curable at home. And and drug companies hate it. A one session physical cure to all human diseases. No drugs or Dr. Involved.If Xi Jinping, the Chinese emperor, does not want to go down in history as a bigger mass murderer then even Mao se T'ung, he must ensure that every Dr. In China uses HIUS.To totally clear Corona in a day.

The State Department issued a Level 4 Travel Advisory for China (do not travel). The CDC is recommending that travelers avoid all non-essential travel to China, and UC President Janet Napolitano issued a directive requiring UC limit non-essential UC-related travel to China. CDC Guidelines for investigation have been expanded to include recent travel to mainland China in people with severe disease (see below). A single case of transmission between close household contacts has been reported in the United States. Today the first Bay Area case has been reported, in Santa Clara County. Details are not available. Declaring a public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar today said the president has imposed a temporary ban on entry for foreign nationals who have been to China in the last 14 days. Effective February 2, U.S. citizens returning from mainland China would be subject to health screening and up to 14 days of quarantine. There remain at this time no cases in Alameda County and no deaths or severe disease in the United States. While it is still unknown what proportion of people become severely ill, the majority of people hospitalized internationally are older or have significant underlying medical conditions. UC leadership throughout the system is holding regular conference calls including medical, environmental health & safety, administrative, and emergency management leadership and UC Berkeley senior leaders continue to work closely together to coordinate response and support the campus health and safety. In addition, planning is underway to schedule an informational session by UCB infectious disease experts regarding this emerging infection. UHS continues to see a lot of influenza and people with milder respiratory symptoms concerned about coronavirus. Please be reminded that these infections are prevalent in our community at this time, as is common this time of year. The best protection is handwashing (hand sanitizer works too!) and vaccination (for the flu), and please do stay home if you are ill. Based on the revised CDC Guidelines, please call your healthcare provider (UHS Advice Line for students at (510) 643-7197) immediately if you are ill and fall into one of the following categories: symptoms (fever >100.3F AND cough/difficulty breathing) AND travel to mainland China within the 2 weeks before symptoms start OR contact with a proven case This does NOT mean you have coronavirus, but it means you should put on a mask and get assessed; if you have influenza, we can also offer treatment. Strict CDC guidelines determine who can be tested for coronavirus. Finally, while the CDC informs us that the risk of the virus to the U.S. general population is low, we understand that these can be anxious and stressful times. We encourage all members of the campus community to support each other and look out for each other.\nFor additional information see our FAQ on Coronavirus .

        "content": "After I wrote yesterday's rant, I decided to spend some time with a few friends that I had not seen in some time We sat down and chatted away at the local Tim Horton's and we covered a wide range of subjects... Someone had alerted me that former NBA Los Angeles Lakers player, Kobe Bryant, and his daughter, had just died in a tragic helicopter crash in California, and we all discussed that for a while... But the subject quickly turned to the \"Corona Virus\" and many sitting at the table had the look of shock and fear... They talked openly about what we were all going to do if the \"virus\" came and started killing people locally here in central Canada, and apparently many were indeed brainwashed by the lies coming from the Jew spew media, which especially troubled me.... I tried my best to calm many of their fears and explained some truths about the \"virus\" and that there was no need to panic.... After I left the group, I knew that I needed to continue to show some real truths here at this blog about this \"virus\" just to have people realize that the fear mongering out there is just to have people panic and cry out for their crooked governments to do something to \"ease\" their fears!\nWell, I came across the following report, from the Waking Times website, at www.wakingtimes.com, that is entitled: \"8 Things To Consider Before Panicking About The Coronavirus\" and indeed gives some valid points to show that people should think about before they allow themselves to fall victim to the hysteria and panic about this \"virus\" Here in fact is that article for everyone to see right here, and I have my own thoughts and comments to follow:\n8 THINGS TO CONSIDER BEFORE PANICKING ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS January 25, 2020\nPhillip Schneider , Staff Writer Waking Times If you read the news, you\u2019ve likely heard about the \u201cdeadly\u201d coronavirus in China. You\u2019ve probably seen videos of sick people and heard about the impending doom that our great nation faces if we don\u2019t do something about this grave threat coming from China. But have you ever thought about why we\u2019re hearing so much about this virus, despite it affecting only a relatively small number of people in another country? Who benefits from a mass media hype around the Coronavirus?\n1. This Story is Getting Massive Hype No one can deny the incredible hype that this story is getting. But, why? Nearly every major news outlet is front-paging the news about the virus. NBC warns of the rising death toll, CNN frightens us with \u201cdiving\u201d stocks due to coronavirus fears (the DOW dropped by 0.6% while other stocks like Bowing grew by 1.7%), the Drudge Report sounds the alarm on the spreading outbreak triggering the quarantine of 56 million people, but China\u2019s state run communist newspaper, the People\u2019s Daily, reports only 41 total deaths from coronavirus and 34 cured and released, with the total number of confirmed cases to date at 1287 . Yet, every new development is serious front page news. CNBC released an updating map of those affected by the virus. In China, it looks like they are absolutely swamped with illness, however, to say that the true number of cases is minuscule compared with China\u2019s population of 1.4 billion would be the world\u2019s greatest understatement of the century. Is the media simply reporting justifiably on a virus that could potentially affect millions of people, or do they have ulterior motives? 2. Nobody Knows Where the Virus Came From So, where did the virus come from anyway? Some speculate it originated in snakes , or previously from bats or contact with other animals in an open-air food market in Wuham, but if that\u2019s true, is there no connection to the fact that the Chinese government opened up a new biolab in the same city, allegedly tasked with studying the \u201cworld\u2019s most dangerous pathogens\u201d? Even the science journal Nature was concerned with the facility prior to its operation in 2017 . So, did the Chinese government accidentally or intentionally release the virus? Did it end up in bats, then snakes, then humans? Why were they working on studying this virus in the first place, and who benefits from its release?\n3. The Media Makes Top Dollar from Your Fear Along with America\u2019s other biggest go-nowhere news story of the week, Trump\u2019s impeachment process, the media rakes in huge sums of money from reporting on medical fear stories. Media executives know that people will tune in to watch a deadly virus sweep the globe. The fear that you experience from thinking about the potential for mass quarantine and death, paralyzes and keeps most people locked into consuming more fear-inducing coverage. Hence, more moola for the fat cats at CNN, NBC, etc. Bad news is good for business, and while statistically speaking you should be far more concerned for your safety every time you get into an automobile, nothing gets clicks like fear and panic. 4. Governments Always Seek More Control from Virus Scares What is the logical conclusion for a population of fearful and paralyzed individuals with no experience combatting a new and deadly virus? Giving the authorities more power, of course.. Let the government forcefully inoculate you and your family, allow the medical-industrial complex to take more of your hard-earned money, and watch silently with the fear that standing up for your rights might lead to the destruction of the human race. 5. This Happens Every Few Years and Pushes Important Issues to the Back Page It isn\u2019t hard to find examples of medical hysteria in the past, either. Think back to Ebola , the Swine flu, the regular flu , measles, SARS, or even the plague . Every few years, the media ramps up its coverage of a new virus that often harms a very insignificant number of people. The medical establishment calls for more control, governments call for more control, and important stories get vigorously back-paged. As a nation, we end up wasting valuable time on a non-issue that was never going to matter to begin with, the only net-result being a marked increase in fear and stress.\n6. The Coronavirus Doesn\u2019t Affect You Chances are pretty solid that you won\u2019t even meet someone who was affected in any way by the coronavirus. Statistically, it makes no sense to worry about the virus when you likely know someone personally who was or will be affected by poverty, the drug war , junk food -induced diabetes, opiate addiction, cancer, heart-disease, the looming national debt, war, a lack of clean food or water, stress, taxation, unconstitutional no-knock SWAT raids , pollution , depression, etc. Focusing all of your attention on this new fear is illogical when you consider that we live in a world of daily threats and dangers anyhow. And by the way, spoiler alert\u2026 none of us make it out of here alive. Furthermore, those who are dying from the virus are not actually dying from the virus, but rather from health complications resulting from having the virus and a compromised immune system, like pneumonia. If the national media genuinely wanted you to be safe, they would be running wall-to-wall coverage of how to naturally boost your immune system and get your body into a state of maximum health, but they rarely mention this fact. 7. The Institutions Who Benefit from Coronavirus Hype are Incompetent and Dangerous The institutions, including the CDC, vaccine companies, and media who benefit from coronavirus hype, are incredibly incompetent and dangerous. One might even go so far as to call them diabolical. We all know about the infamous and highly-publicized syphilis experiments that began in the 1930\u2019s, and CDC director Dr. Branda Fitzgerald who was forced to resign in early 2018 after she was caught buying shares of Merck, a major vaccine company that the CDC is supposed to oversee. There\u2019s no shortage of medical corruption in the U.S., both historically and contemporarily, if you look hard enough. Already the pharmaceutical industry is \u2018 racing to develop a vaccine ,\u2019 which when coupled with government mandates equals insane revenue.\n8. Grainy Videos of Dead and Sick-Looking People Are Being Used to Scare You To top it all off, much of the evidence we\u2019re getting from the media is sketchy at best. Earlier, the Daily Star ran a photograph of two men in lab coats, one of which was lying on the ground. The photo is extremely grainy and out of focus. Meanwhile, what are we supposed to make of it? There\u2019s no context here or proof that the photo is really what they say it is. Yet, it was featured in all caps on the drudge report. \u201cDOCTORS COLLAPSE\u201d, it says along with a plethora of other headlines. \u201c Experts fear too late for China \u201d \u201c Everyone will get infected \u201d \u201c Simulation Predicts 65 Million Could Die \u201d Anyone who\u2019s been paying attention could have predicted the rise of the coronavirus and know what the outcome will be. Mass hysteria and collective fear will be used to further erode individual liberties and stoke allegiance to the medical industrial complex. By simply being aware, however, that fearing all the news is illogical, while continuing to focus on your health and wellness, you automatically subvert this attempt at mass control.

And sadly there are already so many idiots out there falling for it, and I have personally seen it for myself!\nYes, there are now supposedly \"81\" victims of this \"deadly\" virus as of the time I am filing this report, primarily in and around the Chinese city of Wuhan, but again that number is so minor in comparison to other diseases out there... But the criminals that run our Jew spew media and our crooked governments cannot let a good \"epidemic\" go to waste\nI for one will continue to find the real truths about this \"virus\" and have them posted at this blog when available... I will not fall for the hysteria however, because as a man of science and logic, I am seeking facts and truth rather than fiction..\n",

        "content": "China\u2019s acting ambassador to Israel came under well-deserved fire this week for invoking the Nazi genocide of the Jews to criticize Jerusalem\u2019s preventive measures against the spread of the coronavirus.\nAt a press conference in Tel Aviv on Sunday, Dai Yuming said that he felt \u201cbad and sad\u201d over the \u201cerrors to limit or even ban entries of Chinese citizens\u201d into Israel \u201cbecause it actually recalled me the old days, the old stories that happened in World War II, the Holocaust. Many Jewish were refused when they tried to seek assistance. Only very, very few countries opened their doors. One of them is China. I hope Israel will never close their door to the Chinese. In the darkest days of the Jewish people, we didn\u2019t close the door on them. I hope Israel will not close the door on the Chinese.\u201d\nDai\u2019s comments could not have been more outrageous.\nThe outcry that they unleashed in the press and on social media spurred the Chinese embassy in Israel to express regret. In a statement issued to the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Beijing\u2019s diplomatic mission basically claimed that its representative\u2019s words had been misconstrued.\n 7, 2020 1:26 pm 0 The Palestinian Street Has Lost Faith in Abbas JNS.org - The Arab League\u2019s decision to support Palestinian Authority (PA) leader Mahmoud Abbas\u2019 rejection of Donald Trump\u2019s peace plan...\n\u201cWe would like to clarify that there was no intention whatsoever to compare the dark days of the Holocaust with the current situation and the efforts taken by the Israeli government to protect its citizens,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe would like to apologize if someone understood our message the wrong way.\u201d\nReally? As though it would have been possible to interpret it as anything but what it was: an accusation that Israel was turning its back on victimized men, women, and children under threat of annihilation in their country of origin, and a plea for the Jewish state and its citizens to remember how that particular type of rejection felt during World War II.\nThe chutzpah is startling, though not surprising, given the regime that Dai serves. You know, the one that commits Nazi-like atrocities against members of its society with impunity \u2014 and without batting an eyelash.\nThese barbaric acts include the holding of more than a million Muslims in concentration camps, where they are subjected to torture, forced organ removal, and abortions , among other medical \u201cexperiments.\u201d\nIndeed, on the one hand, Dai was engaging in the all-too-common practice of singling out Israel for condemnation while the rest of the world\u2019s countries, particularly his own, not only have been scrambling to contain the deadly virus, but are adopting policies to keep it from continuing to cross borders. On the other, he was being a loyal Communist diplomat, spewing strategic propaganda with a purpose, part of which is to deflect from some inconvenient truths.\nAmong these is Beijing\u2019s desperate attempt to downplay the number of its citizens who have contracted the virus and lie about the death toll. This is clear from the way in which huge swaths of the population are forbidden from leaving their homes without face masks \u2014 which have all but run out due to the demand that outweighs the supply \u2014 and arrested violently by police if they fail to do so.\nIn stark contrast, Israel is trying to be both proactive and productive. Where the former is concerned, Chinese citizens landing at Ben-Gurion International Airport are sent back home (or elsewhere), and Israelis returning from China are required to remain under self-imposed house quarantine for two weeks.\nAs for the latter: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has tasked Israel\u2019s Institute for Biological Research and Health Ministry with developing a vaccine for the coronavirus. Of course.\nMeanwhile, at the request of Chabad in China, Magen David Adom \u2014 Israel\u2019s national emergency and ambulance service \u2014 sent 2,000 face masks and 200 full-body protection kits to the People\u2019s Republic. Natch.\nDai, his embassy staff, and the regime in Beijing should be thanking Israel, not pretending to rue outlandish remarks about the Holocaust.",

At this time, diagnostic testing for 2019-nCoV can be conducted only at CDC.\nTesting for other respiratory pathogens should not delay specimen shipping to CDC. If a PUI tests positive for another respiratory pathogen, after clinical evaluation and consultation with public health authorities, they may no longer be considered a PUI. This may evolve as more information becomes available on possible 2019-nCoV co-infections.\nFor biosafety reasons, it is not recommended to perform virus isolation in cell culture or initial characterization of viral agents recovered in cultures of specimens from a PUI for 2019-nCoV.\nTo increase the likelihood of detecting 2019-nCoV infection, CDC recommends collecting and testing multiple clinical specimens from different sites, including all three specimen types\u2014lower respiratory, upper respiratory, and serum specimens. Additional specimen types (e.g., stool, urine) may be collected and stored. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a PUI is identified regardless of time of symptom onset.

A novel corona virus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. It was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China and now spreading to USA, Canada, Australia etc. globally. 2019-nCoV is a beta-corona virus, like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ), all of which might have their origins in bats. The virus is named due to its shape of a crown with protrusions around it and hence is known as coronavirus. 2019 \u2013 nCoV, noval corona virus Signs and Symptoms of novel (new) corona virus (nCoV): About 3,000 persons have been confirmed till now and about 100 deaths from this virus infection, majority of these are in China. For confirmed 2019-nCoV infections, reported illnesses have ranged from infected people with little to no symptoms to people being severely ill and dying. Symptoms as per CDC.gov can include: Fever Cough Shortness of breath Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, if a corona virus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract (your windpipe and your lungs ), infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Prevention and Treatment of n-CoV: So, how to prevent it and what are the treatments available? Sadly, there is currently no treatment or vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. Help from source: WHO (World Health Organisation) Frequently clean hands by using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick and avoid direct unprotected contact with live animals. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. The consumption of raw or under-cooked animal products should be avoided.

        "content": "Dr. Don Harte, noted chiropractic activist and former Libertarian State Senate candidate, is \u201cextremely concerned about unsubstantiated reports of flu deaths, along with lack of public health response to Chinese viral threat.\u201d\nDr. Harte says, \u201cIt seems that our so-called public health officials are deliberately creating fear, and hoping for panic. They are ginning up fears of the flu, combined with a possible corona virus epidemic.\n\u201cI am deeply concerned about what others may be relieved about,\u201d Dr. Harte admits. \u201cReports are coming in of corona virus vaccines being rushed to completion and then production, via new technology.\u201d\nDr. Harte declares, \u201cNew technology seems exciting to some, but in Medicine, it\u2019s Russian roulette. Who knows the ramifications, both in safety and efficacy, of this totally novel vaccine for a novel virus? The regular vaccines create enough serious health problems.\u201d\n\u201cA fascinating, and scary part of this blossoming health problem is that CDC officials are saying, at least for the moment, that influenza, the flu, is a far more serious threat to Americans than the corona virus. What we have here,\u201d comments Dr. Harte, \u201cis fear from the corona virus being used, very deliberately, to increase fear of the flu virus, and, thereby, increase sales of the mostly ineffective and definitely risky flu vaccine.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps the most serious issue,\u201d Dr. Harte notes, \u201cis the believability of the CDC. It has \u2018cried wolf\u2019 far too many times, and continues to do so. For years, the CDC has claimed that the flu kills 36,000 a year in this country. Last flu season, all of a sudden, they claimed 82,000.\u201d\n\u201cWe can only know,\u201d Dr. Harte says, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on in China and around the world with the new corona virus through news reports. We all know, from personal life experience, that no one we knew ever died from the flu, while everyone we know has had the flu, many several times. Only the already very sick and feeble ever end up in the hospital. Yes, boys and girls, the CDC is lying. Their quasi-statistical trick,\u201d according to Dr. Harte. \u201cis combining flu deaths with pneumonia deaths. Take away pneumonia, and you\u2019re left with a few hundred deaths a year in a nation of 320 million. The obvious conclusion? Influenza, the flu, is not a dangerous, fatal disease.\u201d\nDr. Harte warns, \u201cWhen the corona vaccine comes out, watch out for an all-out fear campaign, from state, federal and international sources. If that vaccine will be as ineffective and dangerous as the flu vaccine, I wouldn\u2019t trust it.\u201d\n\u201cFinally,\u201d explains Dr. Harte, \u201cthe best way to avoid the flu, the corona virus, or any infectious disease, is to get healthy. Eat well, exercise, rest appropriately, and get your nervous system free of interference by regular chiropractic care. Your nervous system runs your immune system, so take care of it! The best way to get the flu is to get a flu shot.\u201d Dr. Harte wonders, \u201cIt might work the same way for the coming corona virus vaccine. So why do it?\u201d\nDr. Don Harte, former medical student, is a principled, traditional chiropractor serving Marin and the Greater Bay Area since 1981. He is an activist in the struggle for free speech for chiropractors. Dr. Harte was named 2006 \u201cChiropractor of the Year\u201d by the World Chiropractic Alliance (WCA).

        "content": "Story by Celia Farber with research contributions from Tracy Beanz\nPart one of an UncoverDC Investigation\nIt\u2019s breathtaking how we have all become self-invented virologists; how strong our opinions are on \u201cviruses,\u201d and what they have in mind for us. It\u2019s never good. I am known for \u201cdenying\u201d the horrors attributed to HIV, which was projected to kill 90 million Americans by 1993, and my denialism brought violent retaliation\u2014but if you check the numbers, I was correct. So were many others, all similarly destroyed for the sin of countering wild fear in an age of viral-mania.\nFear drives markets, and HIV is now a trillion-dollar industry. The level of HIV (measured by questionable technologies) has remained a steady line in the US population since they began measuring. It has not \u201cgone up.\u201d Africa, predicted to be \u201cwiped off the map,\u201d has instead seen a population explosion the same size as the entire US population; over 350 million, since the mid-1980\u2019s.\nThey (the globalists) have been gunning for the next AIDS for a long time.\nBird flu fizzled, SARS, MERS\u2014all of them fizzled. Now we have a new monster, and we are calling it \u201ccorona,\u201d instead of its actual name which is 2019 n-CoV, also known as the \u201cnovel\u201d coronavirus. This is indeed a new nightmare, but not necessarily for the reasons we are being told.\nTracy Beanz and I have been studying the \u201cCorona Situation\u201d, as I will call it, and we are ready to separate some wheat from some chaff. Please know that \u201cviruses\u201d are the most dangerous geo-political pieces on the chess board. Globalists know this and have known it since AIDS.\nClassical virology, along with classical virolog ists , were destroyed by AIDS and displaced by industries of population control and control of the earth\u2019s resources. That said, let\u2019s look closely at the \u201cCorona Situation\u201d. The story is directed by mass media, and therefore, we must navigate via media \u201cevents.\u201d However, before we can say anything intelligible, we must go back, and set the stage. We must tell the back story, and separate media stories from what is actually happening.\nChina just locked down 14 million people. Only China can do something on that scale. Someone should tell Bernie Sanders\u2019 lusty socialists that this is precisely what their revered ideology can deliver. That said, we have to presume there is an enormous problem in China. What is the nature of it?\nWhat our Creator calls a \u201cvirus\u201d verses what the mass globalist media, UN, Bill Gates, or Laurie Garret call a \u201cvirus\u201d are very different. In many cases, \u201cviruses\u201d are technological artifacts, \u201cseen\u201d in the lucrative tests patented to \u201cdetect\u201d them, lacking any real scientific rigor or model to find out what- left to their own devices- and without trillion dollar geopolitical warfare and industry, they might actually do to cells.\nViruses are, with few exceptions, benign, harmless, sometimes even helpful. The notion that we must declare \u201cwar\u201d on them emerges from the post federal reserve military industrial complex, central to which, is the CDC\u2014a military organization. Some recommended reading: Fear Of The Invisible by Janine Roberts. Roberts revealed that \u201cretroviruses\u201d are in fact helpful DNA messenger systems working to protect us against a barrage of toxic threats.\nThe idea that \u201cviruses\u201d (especially RNA viruses) have extreme pathogenicity, super-evil intention, high intelligence, and capacity to spread via human contact, is the single greatest concept a globalist controller has at his disposal. So, we proceed with respect for nature , and begin with a quote from Rudolph Steiner, that perfectly addresses the spiritual battle we face.\nIn 1914, Rudolf Steiner said\n\u201cPeople today are haunted by a fear we can compare with the medieval fear of ghosts. It is the fear of germs. \u2026 The modern age has lost this belief in the spiritual world; it believes in material things. It therefore has a fear of material beings, be they ever so small\u2026.Germs flourish most intensively when we take nothing but materialistic thoughts into sleep with us\u2026(or) live in the center of an epidemic or endemic illness, and (tend) to think of nothing but the sickness all around, filled only with a fear of getting sick\u2026.If this fear can be reduced, even a little by, for example, active love and, while tending the sick, forgetting for a time that one might also be infected, the conditions are less favorable for the germs\u2026.If people were given thoughts that lead them away from materialism and spur them on to active love out of the spirit, it would serve the future of humanity better.\u201d\nPresence of the Dead on the Spiritual Path, May 5, 1914\nRudolf Steiner and Germ Ghosts,\nDr. Kelly Sutton\nThis is important. Viruses have become negative deities in a secular world. If there is a unifying global religion, it is the faith in the necessity of fearing \u201cemerging\u201d viruses, pandemics, \u201cnovel\u201d diseases and so forth. Hype, speed, media, guilt, globalism\u2014all of this breaks down foundational epidemiology, which depends on slowness and rigor. With all these new \u201cviral outbreaks,\u201d we can\u2019t distinguish between the media\u2019s movie and reality. Generally lacking? Viral purification, reliable gold-standard testing, causation modeling, and Koch\u2019s Postulates ; four principles that must be met before you can state that an organism causes a disease.\nSo, what do we know for sure?\nCoronaviruses are a family of common cold viruses. They were detected in the 1960\u2019s and have likely been \u201caround\u201d since the dawn of mankind. There are said to be seven of them. They all cause cough, fever, headache, and respiratory issues. None have ever been considered highly lethal, though it\u2019s hard to separate them from common pneumonia, which is the leading cause of death from infectious disease in the world.\nThe most famous corona-associated illness is SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.) Another, less famous, was called MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.) MERS was thought to have originated in camels. For SARS, which \u201cemerged\u201d in China in 2002 and set off its own panic industrial complex, the final statistics were 8,437 cases in 30 countries, 813 deaths. For MERS, identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, they were 2,494 cases in 27 countries, with 858 deaths. This, despite the fact that Saudi farmers kissed their camels in defiance of government orders to practice \u201ccamel avoidance.\u201d\nFrom a 2012 BBC report , this delightful bit:\nIn recent days, Saudi Arabia has urged people to wear masks and gloves when dealing with camels, to stay away from raw camel meat and camel milk, and not to go near sick animals, the newspaper Gulf News reports . But some people have refused to listen to the government\u2019s advice, posting videos and sending messages in support of camels.\nIn one video , a man stands between a pair of camels and asks it to sneeze. \u201cLook at me! Sneeze, sneeze! They say there\u2019s Corona in this,\u201d the man says, while hugging and kissing his two camels. Then he shakes one of the camels\u2019 heads and says, \u201cShe says no. Is there Corona in you? She says no.\u201d\nIn a 2005 paper, coronavirus was described in children hospitalized with respiratory tract infections in the Netherlands, where 9.3% of 300 specimens tested positive for human coronavirus. None died. Ah, you say, but this was not the novel Corona virus. This is true, and the significance of that we will get to shortly.\nPneumonia is the leading cause of death in adults and children in rural China, and the fourth leading cause of death overall. As biochemist Dr. Dave Rasnick points out in a recent interview, 2.8 million to 17 million Chinese die of pneumonia every year.\nStill, the narrative about the new coronavirus (2019 nCoV) is this: A \u201cstring of mysterious pneumonia cases\u201d appeared in the city of Wuhan, population 11 million, thought (for reasons never explained) to be associated with a seafood market, selling a variety of animals, including live ones. I am not clear what makes one pneumonia \u201cmysterious\u201d but not another, in China.\nAccording to factcheck.org : \u201cOfficials reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization on Dec 31\u2026.By Jan. 7, Chinese authorities had isolated 2019 nCoV as the cause of the disease, and shared the genome a few days later. This allowed other countries to test for the virus, and for scientists to begin devising treatments and investigating how the outbreak began.\u201d\nThe WHO declared the Corona outbreak a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d on January 30th. There are reports of mass cremations, of people being arrested, imprisoned for shooting video inside hospitals; but there is also seemingly state sanctioned video of brave doctors tearfully bidding their families goodbye to march off into certain death on the Corona battle front. It\u2019s never been more important to use the word \u201costensibly\u201d in front of every \u201cfact\u201d we believe we see on our screens.\nThe media landscape is this: legacy media are scolding \u201cconspiracy\u201d theorists for spreading \u201cfalsehoods\u201d about the novel coronavirus. Chief among them? That it is a biological weapon that \u201cescaped\u201d a level 4 lab or was possibly stolen by Chinese spies working at level 4 labs in Canada. Said conspiracy theorists, many of them, are citing a draft paper, now retracted, that claimed there were four \u201cHIV inserts\u201d in the nCoV genome; a genome which China shared as soon as it was sequenced. For more information on genomes, you can find that interview mentioned above in a link at the bottom of this piece.\nDr. Francis Boyle of The Council for Responsible Genetics has been featured on InfoWars and other outlets with his theory that this is a bio-weapon, with a fusion of HIV, SARS, and synthetic vectors. He is coining the term \u201cdeath scientists,\u201d scientists working with the weaponization of organisms, who seek out pathogens to DNA splice, enhance, and reverse engineer with vaccines. \u201cThe whole synthetic biology field has been financed by The Pentagon, for biological warfare purposes,\u201d he told Owen Shroyer, pointing out that there is a BSL-4 lab in Wuhan.\nMy point does not necessarily conflict with his: My point is that none of this goes on in nature. The Globalists\u2019 evil is precisely that they impose upon nature their own dark works. The effect is to displace that which is nature, creation, which aims always at life, with something that aims always at death.\nThis is, in my mind, the great danger.\nI don\u2019t deny that any weaponized pathogen could cause a \u201cpandemic.\u201d I deny that a coronavirus as seen in medical literature past and present shows any signs of sudden death pathogenic impact, and possibly even more so one that was briefly reported to contain \u201cHIV\u201d. As a scholar of twenty years on the topic of HIV, I speak from a position of some stature.\nThe other conspiracy theorists are being derided over the notion that corona scare is a prelude for a vaccine that already exists. Here it gets interesting. The best way to find truth in this arena is to look at the admonishment and derision in mainstream media and investigate the opposite. There is always a very precise way you are meant to respond to viral terror campaigns, to be a good person, appropriately aware of the threat.\nA January 25th USA Today article scolds : \u201cFollowing the outbreak of a respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus in Wuhan, China in December and the announcement of the first American case Jan. 21, several groups and individuals are circulating false rumors on Facebook about the mystery pathogen . Numerous posts claim the virus has been patented \u2014 and some even suggest, incorrectly, that the virus was made in a lab and a vaccine already exists. \u201cThe new fad disease called the \u2018coronavirus\u2019 is sweeping headlines,\u201d one Facebook post , taken from Twitter, reads. Another, which was shared by others , and is part of a series of false coronavirus posts, proclaims that the virus is \u201c\u2018new\u2019 yet it was lab created and patented in 2015 (in development since 03\u2019). In fact, there is no vaccine yet available for the new coronavirus, which for now goes by the unwieldy moniker of 2019 novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV. And there is no patent related to the new virus, either.\u201d\nThis makes it sound like no vaccines exist for any coronavirus. In fact, the US developed a vaccine for SARS, and it was used in China. To wit, from HowStuffWorks :\n\u201cIn 2004, U.S. researchers successfully gave a SARS vaccine to mice in a trial. The researchers later exposed these mice to the actual SARS vaccine; they found that these mice had very few virus particles in their lungs compared to mice who never received the SARS vaccine. This type of vaccine is much safer than other vaccines that are commonly used, as it uses DNA, rather than killed forms of the actual virus, such as in the conventional flu vaccine .\nIn China, in 2004, researchers successfully vaccinated people with the SARS vaccine. They found that there were very few side effects associated with the vaccine. Researchers claim that an effective and approved SARS vaccine takes three to five years to produce. There is hope, therefore, that if there is another SARS outbreak in the future, the world will be well-equipped with an effective vaccine [source: SciDevNet ].\u201d\nOn Del Bigtree\u2019s show The Highwire , scientist James Lyons-Weiler from The Institute for Applied Knowledge stepped forward and said he had analyzed the new Corona virus\u2019 entire genetic sequence and found a \u201cweird element.\u201d He said:\n\u201c I \u2019ve analyzed the entire genome sequence of this and compared to the entire genome sequence of all the other coronavirus\u2026.There is this weird element that doesn\u2019t belong there. I have found that it actually did match a vector technology that was from the 1998, that was the first time it was published in the National Academy of Sciences. This victor technology is a mechanism by which molecular biologists insert new genes into viruses and bacteria. It\u2019s really unusual to find a vector technology in a virus that is circulating among humans. So one thing we can say for certain is this particular virus has a laboratory origin. It should not be in the wild. If you take that sequence and compare it to other proteins that it encodes we find that it is actually a SARS protein that was put into coronavirus for the purpose of making the vaccine work better.\u201d\nI would implore you to visit Dr. Lyons-Weiler\u2019s website and take a read through some of the research done into this recent outbreak. Eye opening, for sure. There will be more we address here. Much more, in fact.\nPut simply, the SARS scare led to a SARS vaccine. The new coronavirus has a \u201cweird element\u201d that is an \u201cinsert,\u201d or \u201cvector technology\u201d that is a \u201cSARS protein,\u201d that was supposed to make the vaccine work better. The mystery is, why is a coronavirus, a family of viruses which cause respiratory distress but are not commonly fatal, (basically cold viruses) and have been around seemingly forever, suddenly causing China to shut down, leading to global panic?\nI found five words in a PLoS paper from 2006, that worried me. The paper is called \u201cVaccine Efficacy In Senescent Mice Challenged with Recombinant SARS-CoV Bearing Epidemic and Zoonotic Spike Variants\u201d . The five words are: \u201c\u2026 pathological changes in the lungs.\u201d Never mind that it worried me, it worried the authors of the paper. They wrote:\n\u201cThe researchers created vaccines based on SARS-CoV S and SARS-CoV N by taking the genes coding for those proteins and inserting them into another type of virus particle that acted as a delivery vehicle. They injected mice with these vaccines and then tested whether the mice generated an immune response against the specific SARS proteins, which they did. The next step was to work out whether mice injected with the vaccines would be protected against later infection with SARS-CoV. The researchers found that mice injected with vaccine based on SARS-CoV S were protected against later infection with a standard SARS-CoV strain, both in the short term (eight weeks after vaccination) and the long term (54 weeks after vaccination). However, the vaccine based on SARS-CoV N did not seem to result in protection, and, worryingly, caused pathological changes in the lungs of mice following virus challenge.\u201d (emphasis added)\nIf we are looking at a bio-lab catastrophe here, it seems likely the catastrophe was caused by genetic tampering gone wrong. What happens to Chinese people, vaccinated with SARS vaccine, who are then re-exposed to a coronavirus? Is this what is making this coronavirus so deadly? Or, is it deadly? Is it deadly only in Chinese? Have any non-Chinese died? The literature on 2019 n-CoV does not reflect catastrophic pathogenicity that would explain events in China. We must also factor in that we don\u2019t know what the true death toll is, nor can we know who to trust. We are dealing with the nation of China; a communist authoritarian society not well known for truthfulness in information, especially when that information could be detrimental to their image.\nIn a paper titled Corona Virus Panic, David Crowe, who hosts a podcast called The Infectious Myth, and heads the largely ignored think tank \u201cRethinking AIDS,\u201d established in the early 90\u2019s to give voice to the many scientists objecting to Robert Gallo\u2019s infectious HIV/AIDS hypothesis, the following puzzling facts were cited about actual Corona cases:\n\u201cThe symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec 1, 2019. None of his family members developed fever or any respiratory symptoms. No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases. \u201d\nCrowe has broken down cluster groups exposed to 2019 n-CoV. In an email to UncoverDC, he said:\n\u201cIn one paper trying to establish a transmission chain, one of the important people in the chain, who did get quite sick, tested negative despite 18 different samples being tested in various ways. While her son, the 10-year-old, was positive without clinical symptoms. \u201d\nIn another paper trying to establish a transmission chain, three German employees tested positive after meeting with a healthy Chinese woman whose first symptoms were on the plane back to China. Two of those three had no major illness. The third had something similar to a flu, took 3 days off work (not knowing at this time about the Chinese woman\u2019s diagnosis), took no special precautions, and came back to work the same day the Chinese woman informed the company she\u2019d tested positive.\u201d\nWell that\u2019s interesting.\nEither the test is useless, or Germans are immune.\nAt Factcheck.org, I found this:\n\u201cMost corona viruses that infect humans are relatively benign and cause mild respiratory diseases such as the common cold,\u201d said Susan Weiss, a corona virus researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, in a phone interview.\u201d\nThe reported case fatality rate of 2019 nCoV is around 2-3%, as compared to 10% for SARS. There have been a handful of cases in the United States, people returning from China, and one transmission between a married couple in close proximity. All so far have had mild symptoms and recovered.\nAgain, according to Fact Check.org:\n\u201cInitial reports indicate that while healthy people can fall seriously ill, deaths are largely confined to older folks and those with pre-existing conditions such a diabetes, Parkinson\u2019s disease and liver cirrhosis.\u201d\nFrom reporting, this does not appear to be a \u201clevel 4\u201d pathogen. Neither particularly infectious nor particularly pathogenic. But why then, would China elect to quarantine 14 million and shut down its own economy? Something is very, very wrong here.\nI happened upon\u2014who else\u2014Laurie Garrett (CFR, Bill Gates\u2019 favorite author) on a talk show the other day, setting us straight about coronavirus. She was honest enough to admit coronaviruses are one of two common families of cold viruses, then she advised the usual precautions: hand washing, gloves, and avoidance of human contact. When asked about that part by one of the hosts, a change came over her. Her voice became louder, and she grew extra animated when she said, in an almost irritated tone of voice: \u201c We call it social distancing.\u201d\nWe do ?\nHow many millions of dollars in Globalist slush funds did it take for them to produce that little gem of social engineering?\nNone of the deferential hosts challenged her on the long list of plagues she has peddled that failed to materialize, including AIDS, Bird Flu, SARS, Zika\u2013\nHere\u2019s a classic Laurie Garrett lede, from a 2005 article in Foreign Affairs titled The Next Pandemic?\n\u201cScientists have long forecast the appearance of an influenza virus capable of infecting 40 percent of the world\u2019s human population and killing unimaginable numbers. Recently, a new strain, H5N1 avian influenza, has shown all the earmarks of becoming that disease. Until now, it has largely been confined to certain bird species, but that may be changing.\u201d\nAnd this graph is also a classic:\n\u201cIn short, doom may loom. But note the \u201cmay.\u201d If the relentlessly evolving virus becomes capable of human-to-human transmission, develops a power of contagion typical of human influenzas, and maintains its extraordinary virulence, humanity could well face a pandemic unlike any ever witnessed. Or nothing at all could happen. Scientists cannot predict with certainty what this H5N1 influenza will do.\u201d\nYes, Laurie, we note the \u201cmay.\u201d It\u2019s one of your favorite words. A great many things \u201cmay\u201d happen, but media ought to devote itself to what has happened.\nJohns Hopkins University has launched a \u201cvisualization tool,\u201d to help you see all the countries where Corona cases turn up. The CDC has also \u201c\u2026launched its own state and global maps to show the location of confirmed cases.\u201d\nAnd what\u2019s more? Every single detail of the script for this corona \u201cpandemic\u201d was foreshadowed in the CDC-backed Soderberg propaganda film Contagion , in 2011: The virus originates from Hong Kong. People keel over dead. It came from bats. The CDC recommends \u201csocial distancing.\u201d It is feared to be a biological weapon. It trashes \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d and people who peddle \u201cherbs\u201d and \u201csnake oil\u201d on the internet. Public quarantines are imposed. It was filmed literally on the grounds (Druid Hills) of CDC headquarters in Atlanta, EIS officers were script consultants, as well as CDC, and Laurie Garrett, Lawrence Brilliant, the WHO, W. Ian Lipkin and a host of other plague luminaries. Scientists praised the ghastly movie\u2014even Paul Offit loved it.\nIt was produced by Jeffrey Skoll\u2019s Participant Productions \u201cdedicated to entertainment intended to spur social change.\u201d And its budget was a whopping $60 million.\nThere are many ways to interpret the mass quarantine in China. Most media, and NIH\u2019s Anthony Fauci, have taken Chinese action as an indication of a coming \u201cpandemic.\u201d But the Chinese are already suggesting the worst is over\u2013that early detection and \u201ctimely quarantine,\u201d while waiting out the incubation period will end the crisis. Zhong Nanshan, described as a \u201crenowned Chinese respiratory expert,\u201d has said the death rate can be expected to drop soon . Unlike HIV, the Chinese themselves have promised this will not be rolled out as a \u201cforever virus\u201d, but rather, as Nanshan says, \u201cThose without clinical symptoms do not actually have the disease.\u201d That means it likely won\u2019t become a parallel monetary system, like the HIV industry.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the trillion dollar HIV industry isn\u2019t getting in on the action. A combination of two anti-HIV drugs is being used to treat novel corona patients, which is alarming, as it could peg highly toxic drugs to a lung related illness that scientists, by their own admission, don\u2019t have really any answers about . That is worrying many scientists in the field, and many of them are sounding the alarm. We\u2019ve already established that up to 17 million Chinese die of pneumonia (as opposed to \u201cmysterious pneumonia\u201d) every year. I still do not understand what made these pneumonia cases stand out, leading to the lock-down and the global panic. HIV drugs are certainly not indicated as first line treatment for pneumonia.\nGlobalists like global diseases and pandemics. They love contagion and nothing else. Environmentally induced illnesses don\u2019t interest them at all. All their conferences, grants, NGO\u2019s, galas\u2013 all of that depends upon contagion as religion. A curious and off-putting faith in the invisible viral deity\u2019s capacity to do supernatural things we can\u2019t see yet.\nNobody should listen to a word Anthony Fauci says, that much is certain. He has yet to come clean that none of his propaganda about HIV\u2019s sexual spread has panned out, never mind its lack of purification, pathogenicity, etc. A 10-year study was done that Tony Fauci would prefer we never mention. Known as the \u201cPadian study,\u201d it was a study to see how infectious HIV was. The focus was on HIV antibodies. In the study were 175 \u201cdiscordant\u201d couples, one HIV positive, one HIV negative. The couples had sex freely and often unprotected over a 10 year period. No seroconversions were observed. Padian has express fury at \u201cdeniers\u201d who cite her study as proof the HIV theory is wrong. But the study is hard to deny or erase from history. All they can ever do is destroy the messengers.\nWe don\u2019t know what is going in in China\u2014not yet. It\u2019s clear that something is very wrong, and that it has lots of people, from government bureaucrats to the citizens experiencing these conditions in China, to our elected officials, and even the CDC, confused. The only question is, what exactly are they confused about? Does anybody have the script or are we working from a tear in the globalist\u2019s tightly spun fabric?\nOr better to say: Straight-jacket.\nThis is a continuing series from UncoverDC.

So far 3 cases of this virus have been reported in Kerala. WHO has released the virus to the International Emergency. As the corona virus continues to wreak havoc, movement has been completely halted in many cities of China to prevent the virus from spreading. At the same time, the most affected Wuhan has been completely sealed. There is an atmosphere of fear among people about this virus. Every small update related to this virus can make you aware. Images Source : thesun.co.uk\nLet\u2019s know where these dangerous viruses came from and what are the symptoms and prevention? Also how did it get its name. Where did this virus come from?\nSeveral types of research have been reported so far regarding this virus. According to CNN, a doctor associated with an NGO working on environment and health has said that if you look closely at the genetic sequence of the corona virus, it looks close to the bats. A study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention also reported that according to the data found so far, the corona virus has been seen in bats before.\nChinese scientists had warned about the \u2018epidemic\u2019 outbreak a year ago, and research is going on continuously in China about the diseases caused by bats. Even Chinese scientists had warned a year ago that the corona virus could spread through bats in China. The special thing is that this warning was also issued by the scientists of Wuhan. How the name Corona got :\nWhen the Sun feels eclipse, that is, during the eclipse, when the Earth completely covers the Sun, then the sun stops appearing in the form of a sphere, but its rays show the light spreading everywhere, which is rapidly changing the universe. Looks extinct in It can also be understood in such a way that it becomes a structure similar to a sunflower flower. Which is black from the middle and soft rays of light are spreading around its circle, like the petals of sunflower. This light of the sun spreading around the shadow of the earth is called corona. For this reason, the virus was named Corona because it has a similar shape to that of Corona. Actually, the virus is round and has stained branches of proteins like the corona of the earth on its surface. Which feels spread in every direction. How to protect yourself from coronavirus\nThe most important thing is that if you consume sea food, then it should be avoided immediately, because the main source for the emission of corona virus is still being attributed to sea food. Since no vaccine has yet been developed to prevent coronavirus, caution is the best way to prevent it.\nWHO\u2019s standard recommendations for the general public to reduce exposure to and transmission of a range of illnesses are as follows, which include hand and respiratory hygiene, and safe food practices: Frequently clean hands by using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water; When coughing and sneezing cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue \u2013 throw tissue away immediately and wash hands; Avoid close contact with anyone who has fever and cough; If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early and share previous travel history with your health care provider; When visiting live markets in areas currently experiencing cases of novel coronavirus, avoid direct unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals; The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, milk or animal organs should be handled with care, to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices.",

DOH said severe cases may cause pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and sometimes lead to death.\nDuque said coronaviruses can be transmitted \u201cvia aerial droplets\u201d or through coughing and sneezing.\n\u201cGlobally, novel coronaviruses emerge periodically in different areas, including SARS in 2002 and MERS in 2012. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. As surveillance improves, more coronaviruses are likely to be identified,\u201d the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement last Jan. 9.\n2019-nCoV\nLast Jan. 9, the WHO said the then-\u201cmysterious virus\u201d was an unknown strain of coronavirus. It was suspected that the virus originated in a seafood market in Wuhan, China.\nThe virus then spread to other Asian countries including Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hongkong. It has also already reached the United States of America.\n\u201cInitially, the said disease was thought to be transmitted through animal contact but recent reports show human-to-human transmission,\u201d Duque said.\nReports said the virus is being linked to wild animals being sold in food markets in Wuhan City.\nHowever, WHO Country Representative to the Philippines Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe emphasized that \u201cat this point in time, there are still a lot of unknown issues\u201d surrounding the new virus.\n\u201cWe are not sure of the source of the virus\u2013where they came from\u2013an animal meat or another source. We believed that there may be human-to-human transmission. The situation at this point in time, we still need to [better] understand the mode of transmission and what needs to be done specifically for management,\u201d Abeyasinghe said.\n\u201cWe are in the early stage of trying to understand how severe this infection is and how many deaths that it will likely cause.\u201d\nAllaying fears\n\u201cThe WHO or the Chinese Ministry [of Health] until now has not located the source of the virus,\u201d Health Undersecretary Rolando Enrique Domingo said.\nHe allayed fears concerning the new strain of coronavirus, saying its manifestations are not that \u201csevere\u201d compared to SARS and MERS-CoV.\n\u201cFirst of all, what we see now with the 2019-nCoV \u2026.for most patients, it\u2019s not fatal. There have been reports of 17 fatalities out of more than 540 cases\u2013meaning 97 percent of the patients have mild disease or recovered,\u201d Domingo said.\n[There are now 26 deaths and 830 infected as of this posting.]\n\u201cLike any other illness, like any other flu, talagang ang nakikita rin natin dito na meron talagang potential na magkaroon ng complications and even result in death would be those who are weaker, mga immunocompromised, may mga sakit na iba, mga matatanda, saka s\u2019yempre mga bata (Like any other illness, like any other flu\u2013 we are seeing that those who have the potential to have complications and even result in death would be those who are weaker, immunocompromised, who have pre-existing medical condition, elderly people, and children),\u201d Domingo said.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said SARS \u201chad caused a worldwide outbreak in 2002 to 2003 with 8,098 probable cases including 774 deaths.\u201d In the Philippines, \u201c10 probable cases with two deaths\u201d were recorded during the outbreak, the WHO said.\nDomingo said they only suspect a person of being infected with 2019-nCoV infection if:\n1. There is a history of travel to China, particularly to Wuhan;\n2. The patient has worked in a hospital in Wuhan;\n3. The patient has had contact with someone diagnosed with 2019-nCoV;\n4. There are signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection or fever.\n\u201cSo, kailangan kumpleto naman \u2018yung rekado na iyon bago natin masuspetsa na meron tayong infection ng bagong virus na ito (So, these criteria need to be present before we suspect that we have an infection of this new virus),\u201d Domingo said.\nDomingo noted that it is currently the flu season in the Philippines.\n\u201cOtherwise, halimbawa sipon, lagnat, ubo lamang naman, pero hindi naman tayo pumunta sa Wuhan, China (for example, it\u2019s cold, fever, or cough and we did not go to Wuhan, China), then we have to realize that it\u2019s also flu season in the Philippines now. January, February is flu season, and it\u2019s probably the common flu that you have,\u201d he added.\nDuque, meanwhile, said that illnesses caused by coronaviruses are \u201cessentially self-limiting conditions\u201d and one may recover immediately if coupled with \u201csupportive treatment,\u201d adding that strengthening the immune system is very important.\nPH ready\nDomingo assured the public that the DOH is ready to manage cases of 2019-nCoV if ever it is detected in the country.\n\u201cWe have the infrastructure and we have the system ready. It\u2019s really just a matter of activating it. Ever since SARS, meron na tayong quick-response system na gagawin (we have a quick-response system in place). In this case, nagkakaroon lang ng konting (there are a few) modification kasi (because) from SARS to MERS-CoV to novel coronavirus for 2019,\u201d he said.\nAbeyasinghe advised the public to practice good personal hygiene and cook food thoroughly.\n\u201cWhat WHO is advocating together with the DOH is you practice good hygiene. Use soap and wash your hands, particularly if you are having signs of acute respiratory infection. Practice cough etiquette\u2013use tissue or handkerchiefs so that you prevent droplet spread,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis coronavirus\u2014 we\u2019re still not sure of the source of it so as the case of other coronaviruses \u2013we are saying, ensure that your food is properly cooked because it could be coming from animal meat. If you are handling animal meat, make sure if you are handling raw meat, wash your hands, clean your cutting boards, so that there is no possibility of contaminating other fresh food.\u201d\nThe DOH said it is closely coordinating with WHO and China Center for Disease Control for updates regarding the latest developments on the 2019-nCoV.",

        "content": "China is facing accusations from the world community of suppressing and playing down the coronavirus outbreak and the scale of infections which some reports say now I as high as 90,000 while the official Beijing figure is just 1,975.International media reports have said cited a nurse treating coronavirus sufferers in China who claims 90,000 people have already been infected.A nurse wearing a protective suit and face mask treating the sick in Wuhan has claimed that 90,000 people have already been infected by the coronavirus.However, the nurse's report has been viewed almost two million times on YouTube. In the footage, she warns people not to go outside and to refrain from celebrating the Chinese New Year.The animal virus epidemic originated in China, where it has infected more than 1,970 people and killed 56, and has spread worldwide.International critics are saying that the China is censoring the numbers and sanitising videos from the internet.China's President Xi Jinping has already warned of 'grave situation' as killer coronavirus accelerates.American cities are on high alert as two coronavirus cases are confirmed in Chicago and Washington while 1,000 Americans have been told to evacuate Ground Zero in Wuhan.Canadian authorities on Saturday confirmed the first case of coronavirus - a man in his 50s from Toronto.The countries which have reported these cases include Singapore, Malaysaia, South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Australia, Nepal, France, Canada, the US, Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.But the Global Times revealed that vital resources, including masks and goggles, were urgently needed.The accusations of a cover-up echo the furore surrounding the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic in 2002 when the government concealed the existence of the illness not just from the outside world but from its own people.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Saturday declared a virus emergency in the city of 7.3 million, extending school cancellations until February 17 and cancelling all official visits to mainland China.China has quarantined three cities in an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus -- encompassing a total population of some 35 million people.Other reports say several cities are under lockdown with a combined population of 47 million including Wuhan, Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi, Jingzhou, Zhijiang, Qianjiang, Xiantao, Xianning, Huangshi, Dangyang, Enshi, Xiaogan.Jingmen and Shantou.Reports say that Wuhan continues to be under complete lockdown. Police have been stationed at the borders of Wuhan to block the roads preventing any sort of movement into the quarantined city.The city's pharmacies have been swamped by people wanting to stock up on medicines.",

At the same time, countries have been requested to be ready at all times to deal with this deadly virus. The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the coronavirus is also catching people who have never been traveled to China.

        "content": "As Bloomberg's Richard Breslow writes this morning in a note lamenting that there is \"little obvious\" about this market, \"some days it\u2019s best just to let things play out for a little while. Economic numbers that came out overnight haven\u2019t hurt. Very dovish comments by a senior Bank of Japan official. Upbeat comments by the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. And then the big one, hopeful comments concerning potential progress in dealing with the virus outbreak. And the market has taken off. \"\nIndeed, at roughly 3:40am ET, futures surged as much as 30 points, rising to 3,335 and surging just shy of the Jan 22 all time high of 3,337.50, after the following Reuters headline hit: CHINESE TV: RESEARCH TEAM AT ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY HAS FOUND AN EFFECTIVE DRUG TO TREAT PEOPLE WITH THE NEW CORONA VIRUS\nEven though Reuters itself said it has not confirmed the veracity of the report, it was enough to unleash a case of viral (or is that virus) optimism, with futures filling the gap back to all time highs, as algos bought first and asked questions, well never. And in typical broken market fashion, two hours later, when a WHO spokesperson, asked about a coronavirus treatment breakthrough, said there are no known effective therapeutics against the virus, futures barely dipped, or to summarize Dow futs up 300 point on unconfirmed optimism, and down 50 on reality.\nWhat is notable is that Chinese state media first covered this yesterday but was largely ignored by mainstream media; the report got a second wind this morning today however after traders focused on the fact that over 900 people have recovered from the coronavirus, which some took for evidence the treatment is becoming more effective, while ignoring that the 500 or so deaths reported so far is likely are greatly underrepresented number by China which has been burning the vast majority of casualties to literally eliminate the evidence.\nOptimism was also boosted by a separate Sky News report which said U.K. scientists made significant progress for a vaccine by reducing a part of the normal development time from \"two to three years to just 14 days\"; the scientist added that it will be in animal models by the beginning of next week, and the next phase will be to move from early animal testing into the first human studies, which could happen in \"months\", with the report adding that the vaccine will be too late for this current outbreak but it will be crucial if there is another one . though human trials wouldn\u2019t begin for a few months ; at roughly the same time news hit that Chinese researchers have applied for a local patent on an experimental Gilead drug that they believe might fight the coronavirus.\n\"Traders have taken the view that the situation is now more likely to be under control and hopefully the spread of the health crisis will be stemmed,\" said David Madden, market analysts at CMC Markets.\nBut what is the reality on any vaccine? Stated simply, it would take months of trials before anything legitimate got off the ground. In short, nothing that hit overnight provides any indication the world is remotely closer to having an effective means to slowing the current pandemic, but all algos cared about was the optimism that was unleashed by the reports, and lo and behold, we are back to all time highs.\nMeanwhile, stocks also rallied on bad news, as expectations of more central bank stimulus lifted world stocks to their highest in more than a week on Wednesday with the MSCI global benchmark rising 0.3%, helping investors look past a mounting coronavirus death toll and policymakers\u2019 concerns for the disease\u2019s economic impact.\nThe unconfirmed report and the stimulus expectations offset at least partly the news that the virus\u2019s death toll had killed 500 and sickened 25,000.\nSo as a result of both good and bad news, futures on all US indexes turned sharply higher and Europe's Stoxx 600 Index rebounded after a string of reports on possible vaccines or treatments for the deadly pathogen. Contracts on the S&P 500 Index climbed as Tuesday\u2019s the surge in tech stocks continued in premarket trading for Apple and Nvidia. Gilead Sciences edged lower after jumping this week on speculation over its antiviral drug.\nData also showed euro zone and UK business activity accelerated last month, though the figures are now meaningless as the surveys were collected before the coronavirus spread much beyond China. The concerns for economic growth were reflected in signals from the Bank of Japan and the Monetary Authority of Singapore that they were ready to ease policy. BOJ Deputy Governor Masazumi Wakatabe pledged not to rule out any option, including lowering already-negative interest rates; meanwhile in Thailand, the central bank unexpectedly cut rates to a record low 1.0% as the economy has been hard hit by the Coronavirus.\n\u201cClearly... all the central banks are ready to act if necessary,\u201d said Justin Onuekwusi, a portfolio manager at Legal & General Investment Management.\nEarlier in Asia, stocks notched their first back-to-back daily gain in two weeks and headed for their best two-day gain in almost two months as investors assessed earnings releases in the region and the latest status of the coronavirus outbreak, even as quarantines were set up in the Chinese base of iPhone maker Foxconn, at land borders with Hong Kong, on a cruise ship off Japan and U.S. military bases. The region\u2019s benchmark MSCI Asia Pacific Index jumped as much as 0.8%, with most markets trading in the green. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index had its best two-day advance since June, while the ChiNext Index rose another 3% in a continued rebound after the post-holiday slump. Japan\u2019s Topix index advanced as Mitsubishi Corp. and Itochu Corp. climbed after reporting quarterly earnings that beat estimates. China (PBOC) is also likely to lower its key rate on Feb. 20, sources told Reuters. while Thailand unexpectedly cut interest rates.\nIn rates, 10-year Treasury yields rose three basis points to 1.637% while German yields rose 4 bps to a one-week high. Sovereign bond curves across Europe bear steepened, though Treasuries were harder hit by the sell-off.\nIn FX, the dollar was roughly unchanged even as 10Y yields rose, while the Australian dollar led gains in G-10; the franc led declines against the greenback with the yen holding little changed after erasing an earlier gain. The pound extended gains after better- than-forecast services U.K. PMI, which also led money markets to price out expectations for BOE rate cuts to less than 25bps\nIn commodities, crude oil headed for its first gain in six sessions in New York trading: Brent crude also bounced 2.5%, after losing 16% since Jan. 21. It was supported too by expectations OPEC and its allies would cut output to offset lower demand.\nEconomic data include mortgage applications, trade balance and Markit services PMI. Qualcomm, Boston Scientific and General Motors are due to report earnings.\nMarket Snapshot S&P 500 futures up 0.8% to 3,324.50 MXAP up 0.8% to 168.04 MXAPJ up 0.8% to 544.32 Nikkei up 1% to 23,319.56 Topix up 1% to 1,701.83 Hang Seng Index up 0.4% to 26,786.74 Shanghai Composite up 1.3% to 2,818.09 Sensex up 0.9% to 41,169.64 Australia S&P/ASX 200 up 0.4% to 6,976.05 Kospi up 0.4% to 2,165.63 STOXX Europe 600 up 1% to 422.48 German 10Y yield rose 2.6 bps to -0.373% Euro down 0.05% to $1.1038 Brent Futures up 3% to $55.57/bbl Italian 10Y yield unchanged at 0.785% Spanish 10Y yield rose 2.6 bps to 0.295% Brent Futures up 3% to $55.57/bbl Gold spot down 0.01% to $1,552.78 U.S. Dollar Index unchanged at 97.96\nTop Overnight News from Bloomberg: The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak climbed toward 500 as confirmed cases worldwide almost 25,000. Hong Kong announced plans to quarantine travelers coming from the mainland, while thousands remained stuck on cruise ships Chinese researchers have applied for a local patent on an experimental Gilead Sciences Inc. drug that they believe might fight the novel coronavirus outbreak The euro area\u2019s private sector expanded at a faster- than-anticipated pace in January, providing a foundation for economic growth to accelerate in the course of the year, with a composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index rising to the highest since August The Bank of Thailand cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low as the coronavirus outbreak, a stalled government budget and bad drought imperil economic growth, while most other monetary policy makers have stuck to expressing concern and signaling a willingness to act on risks from the virus. Australian central bank Governor Philip Lowe reinforced expectations that policy makers will refrain from more interest- rate cuts Poland became the first emerging-market sovereign to get paid for borrowing in euros via a syndicated bond deal OPEC+ officials gathered in Vienna for a second day of debate on the impact of the coronavirus, a process that could result in an emergency ministerial meeting where Saudi Arabia would push for an oil-production cut\nAsian equity markets were positive across the board as the global rebound filtered through to the region after having underpinned the major indices on Wall St and pushed the Nasdaq to a fresh record high . ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) were both higher after taking impetus from stateside peers with tech and commodity-related sectors the outperformers in Australia but with gains limited by resistance at the 7000 level and with gold miners suffering as investors shunned safe-havens, while gains in Tokyo were exacerbated by a weaker currency. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.3%) notched respectable gains as the bargain hunting resumed in the mainland, unfazed by softer Caixin Services and Composite PMIs, continued increases in the number of coronavirus cases and the PBoC skipping open market operations in which it noted that current liquidity is ample and can fully meet market demand. Finally, 10yr JGBs extended on this week\u2019s pullback from the 153.00 level and following the bear-steepening in USTs in which T-notes retreated below 131.00 as the gains across stocks sapped safe-haven demand.\nTop Asian News Singapore Dollar Tumbles After MAS Flags Scope for Decline Hong Kong Will Quarantine Travelers Coming From Mainland China China Virus Shuts Airbus Plant, Hitting Narrow-Body Jet Output Thailand Cuts Interest Rate as Virus Outbreak Hurts Economy\nEuropean equities are firmer across the board [Eurostoxx 50 +1.0%] following a tame open, as risk sentiment was bolstered by unconfirmed reports that a research team at a Chinese university has found an \"effective\" drug to treat people with Coronavirus . Moreover, reports via Sky News suggested that a team of UK scientists reduced the normal development timeframe for a vaccine to 14 days from 2-3 years, but crucially, the report noted that the \u201cvaccine will be too late for this current outbreak, but it will be crucial if there is another one.\" Nonetheless, bourses have held onto gains with sectors staging a complete turnaround from the open. European sectors now largely reflect risk appetite with defensives lagging cyclicals (ex-healthcare). Movers this morning are mostly orientated around earnings - with DAX heavyweight Siemens (+0.5%) initially opening with earnings-induced losses in excess of 1.5% before conforming to the overall gains in the German bourse. On the flip side, Imperial Brands (-7.8%) rests at the foot of the pan-European index following a profit warning in which it now forecasts a circa 10% drop in H1 profits. Other earnings-led movers include Smurfit Kappa (+7.8%), Barratt Developments (+3.3%), Danske Bank (-0.7%), Novo Nordisk (+1.5%) and Infineon (+9.0%). Elsewhere, Adidas (+1.0%) and Puma (+0.2%) shares opened lower to the tune of around 2% after US peer Nike noted that the coronavirus outbreak is expected to have a \u201cmaterial impact\u201d on its Chinese operations. Adidas\u2019 CEO also echoes some comments from Nike in which it sees a negative impact on its Chinese business, but stopped short of giving details or extent of impacts.\nTop European News Vodafone Warns of 5G Delays if Huawei\u2019s Share Capped Beyond U.K. U.K. Services Rebound More Than Expected in Post-Election Bounce ABB Says Coronavirus Threatens China\u2019s Already Fragile Recovery Romania\u2019s Orban Faces Confidence Vote He Doesn\u2019t Mind Losing\nIn FX, the Dollar is holding up firm in the face of a marked pick-up in sentiment surrounding China\u2019s coronavirus based on media headlines suggesting that scientists and researchers may be closer to finding a vaccine than previously anticipated. The reports have boosted the YUAN for obvious reasons, with Usd/Cnh retreating from around 7.0100 to sub-6.9750 and below the 200 DMA (6.9905) not to mention the PBoC\u2019s 6.9823 overnight Usd/Cny mid-point fix. However, the Greenback is forging gains at the expense of safer havens, like the YEN, EURO, SWISS FRANC and GOLD, with the DXY clinging to 98.000 and on course to keep its head above a key Fib retracement level (98.011), barring any bad miss via ADP, final Markit PMIs and/or the non-manufacturing ISM. JPY/CHF/EUR/XAU - As noted above, all weaker vs the Buck and overall on a broad unwind of FTQ premium/positioning, as Usd/Jpy climbs further above 109.50, Usd/Chf reclaims 0.9700+ status, Eur/Usd retreats from near 1.1050 to just under 1.1025 and Usd/Xau retests support circa Usd 1550/oz after briefly tripping stops on a break of Tuesday\u2019s low (Usd 1549) to trade a whisker below Usd 1548. AUD/GBP/NOK/SEK/NZD/CAD - The Aussie has extended post-RBA gains with the aid of commentary from Governor Lowe reinforcing a wait-and-see stance on top of the more encouraging Chinese outbreak news. Aud/Usd has now climbed firmly back above 0.6750 to revisit late January peaks (0.6777), while Aud/Nzd has rebounded over 1.0400 to the detriment of Nzd/Usd that has not been able to regain a sure grip on the 0.6500 handle in wake of somewhat mixed NZ jobs data. Conversely, another handsome UK PMI beat vs consensus has boosted Sterling across board, as Cable hovers close to best levels of the wtd (1.3070) and Eur/Gbp sub-0.8450 following rather contrasting Eurozone services PMIs. Elsewhere, the Scandi Crowns have rebounded alongside risk appetite and the Norwegian Krona especially fuelled by a strong recovery in crude prices whereas its Swedish counterpart is being partially hampered by poor hard data offsetting an upbeat services PMI. Similarly, the Loonie is not deriving that much from the aforementioned bounce in oil ahead of Canadian trade data and a speech from BoC\u2019s Wilkins, albeit with Usd/Cad nearer the base of a 1.3299-62 band. EM - Most regional currencies have tracked Yuan and high-beta peer appreciation, but the SGD and THB have both been subject to dovish MAS and Thai CB vibes in the form of guidance and an unexpected 25 bp ease respectively, while the Try is still on the defensive due to geopolitical factors. Conversely, SA Government backing for COSATU proposals to cut Eskom debt have given the Zar and extra fillip.\nIn commodities, WTI and Brent futures have extended on overnight gains amid the aforementioned reports of seemingly constructive coronavirus headlines. WTI and Brent front-month futures hit fresh 2020 lows (of ~49.30/bbl and 53.70/bbl respectively) in light of a larger than expected headline API inventory build (+4.18mln vs. Exp. +2.8mln). Thereafter, prices clambered off worst levels before piggybacking on the virus headlines which, if true, could significantly improve the demand outlook for the complex. Elsewhere, OPEC\u2019s JTC will convene for the second day of discussions later today after the technical committee reportedly did not discuss production cuts yesterday but will revisit the topic, according to delegates who noted it studied between 200-400k BPD impact on oil demand from the coronavirus. Reports also note that OPEC numbers suggest a circa 400k BPD demand impact for around six months from the coronavirus, although these forecasts are highly contingent on how long the epidemic lasts alongside any prolonged effects. Analysts at ING note that a 500k BPD of additional OPEC cuts in Q1 and a rollover of current cuts in Q2 (through to end-June) should be almost enough to balance the oil market, assuming the OPEC figures are correct and factoring in supply disruptions in Libya. Next up, traders will be eyeing the weekly DoEs with headline crude forecast to print a build of 2.831mln barrels, according to Reuters Estimates. Elsewhere, spot gold conformed to the overall risk appetite as prices briefly dipped below 1550/oz before encountering stops just below the figure. Copper continues yesterday\u2019s sentiment-led rebound as the red metal almost wipes out a bulk of last week\u2019s losses.\nUS Event Calendar 7am: MBA Mortgage Applications, prior 7.2% 8:15am: ADP Employment Change, est. 158,000, prior 202,000 8:30am: Trade Balance, est. $48.2b deficit, prior $43.1b deficit 9:45am: Markit US Services PMI, est. 53.2, prior 53.2; Markit US Composite PMI, prior 53.1 10am: ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, est. 55.1, prior 55\nDB's Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap\nWith coronavirus fears continuing to ease, the last 24 hours have been kind to risk assets once again. The latest numbers show 24,324 cases and 490 deaths as of this morning versus 20,438 and 425 this time yesterday but the fact that there appears to be a slowing in independent incidents in countries outside of China and a slowing in the rate of transmission in cases outside of Wuhan province appear to be making investors more comfortable for now. While this could change, our conclusion was that these were the conditions that needed to be satisfied for markets to feel more at ease following DB\u2019s client call with a virus expert on Monday. For those that missed it the replay details can be found here (link here).\nAs for markets, coming off the back of 8 sessions where by the S&P 500 flipped between gains and losses, yesterday\u2019s +1.50% return means the index is up +2.23% in the last two sessions. The NASDAQ also rallied +2.10% yesterday - a new record high and the biggest gain since August - and the DOW +1.44% which means all three indices are back in positive territory YTD again. Also worth noting was the +4.11% surge for the NYSE FANG index meaning the index is up an impressive +9.10% in the last two sessions. Even copper \u2013 which had been on a 13-session losing run \u2013 finally joined the party, rising +1.40%.\nAt a micro level it was the incredible +13.73% surge for Tesla which really grabbed the spotlight yesterday though. That means the stock is up +36.35% over the last two sessions and 112% this year already. More impressive still is the 435% rally from the 2019 lows. With a market cap of nearly $160bn that also puts the company in between the nominal GDPs of Ukraine and Kazakhstan. For what it\u2019s worth Tesla isn\u2019t in the S&P 500 but a quick look at the index would mean it would be around the 50th largest and would have added roughly 13pts to the index this year. Incidentally, the electric car maker may soon be eligible to join the index now that it is close to posting four straight quarters of profits \u2013 the only requirement the company was short.\nThe more macro focus yesterday was the results of the Iowa caucus and following \u201cinconsistencies in the reporting\u201d we\u2019ve finally had an update overnight. At the time of writing, 71% of the vote has been made official. Currently South Bend Mayor Peter Buttigieg is leading among delegates with 26.8%, followed closely by Senator Sanders with 25.2%, then Senator Warren with 18.4%, and Vice President Biden at 15.4%. This would be a very disappointing result for Biden, who came into the night polling in second place. Mayor Pete became the winning Moderate and while the results are not final, they stand to show the current break in the Democratic primary between the Left (Sanders + Warren = 43%) and the Moderate (Biden + Buttigieg + Klobuchar = 56) wings. Markets are not likely to react strongly to the democratic primary until you see the more Left candidates\u2019 numbers climb higher.\nPrior to this President Trump addressed the nation in his 2020 State of the Union, however there wasn\u2019t a huge amount to report. Trump previewed his 2020 general election pitches; touting a strong economy on the back of deregulation, renewed trade deals, and lower corporate taxes, promising continued focus on immigration reforms, and pushing plans on health care changes. Staying with Trump, yesterday Gallup\u2019s latest approval rating put the President at 49%, which is the most since he took office.\nBack to markets and a quick glance at our screens this morning shows the positive momentum has continued into Asian markets with Chinese bourses leading the advance \u2013 the CSI (+1.13%), Shanghai Comp (+1.25%) and Shenzhen Comp (+2.63%). The Nikkei (+1.42%), Hang Seng (+0.47%) and Kospi (+0.58%) are also making gains. In FX, the Singaporean dollar is down -0.75% this morning as the country\u2019s central bank said that it sees room for more easing. Elsewhere, futures on the S&P 500 are down -0.12% and Brent crude oil prices are up +1.30% overnight even as Saudi Arabia\u2019s push for deeper output reductions to combat the drop in consumption received resistance by Russia. As for overnight data releases, China\u2019s January Caixin services PMI came in at 51.8 (vs. 52.0 expected) bringing the composite to 51.9 (vs. 52.6 expected).\nLooking ahead to today, whether the positive risk momentum continues may depend on the data. Of particular note are the ISM non-manufacturing and ADP employment change prints. The consensus expectation is for the headline in the former to tick up slightly to 55.1 however it\u2019s the employment component which will also be watched closely given payrolls is due at the end of the week. Our economists have highlighted that this series was up a little over three points in December from its September low of 51.7. Thus, further improvement would be a positive sign given that the services sector accounts for nearly 84% of private payrolls. With respect to the ADP employment survey, it has missed the initial BLS prints over the past couple of months by fairly wide margins. Market participants may therefore want to discount somewhat its signal.\nBack to yesterday where, in other markets, there was also a decent bounce back for European equities where the STOXX 600 rallied +1.64%. More interesting were some of the comments at a corporate level regarding the impact of the coronavirus. Oil giant BP suggested that one-third of global oil demand is under threat while Carlsberg mentioned that it\u2019s breweries in China remain closed. Pandora also flagged the risk to its lucrative Asia business. Adding to these comments, one of the key Apple suppliers in China, Hon Hai, slashed its sales growth forecast range overnight to 1% - 3% (from 3% - 5% earlier). Walt Disney also said overnight that it expects the Shanghai park closure alone to reduce profits in the current quarter by $135m, assuming it is shuttered for two months, while the loss from closing of the Hong Kong park would likely add another $40m. In bond markets yesterday the risk-on sentiment saw yields move sharply higher. Indeed 10y Treasury yields backed up +7.2bps while 10y Bunds were +4.3bps higher. Brent and WTI oil retraced over 2% intraday gains to finish down -0.90% and -1.10% respectively as demand concerns mount while Gold edged down -1.31%. In credit, US HY spreads finished 11bps tighter.\nIn other news, yesterday\u2019s data was mostly an afterthought in the US. The final core capex orders reading was revised up one-tenth to -0.8% mom while durable goods ex transport were unrevised at -0.1%. Meanwhile, factory orders were reported as rising +1.8% mom.\nFinally, to the day ahead, where this morning the focus will be on the remaining PMIs in Europe with final January services and composite prints due.

        "content": "IBM Business Partner Evanston Technology Partners and Cylera , recently partnered together to address new challenges facing hospitals, providing asset management and cybersecurity protection, through a newly formed joint Healthcare Asset Operations Center (HAOC) solution that provides healthcare delivery organizations a way to continuously manage, optimize, and secure critical medical devices, including ventilators and supporting healthcare assets such as IoT, operational technology (OT) and network connected devices. \"Hospitals and healthcare providers are rapidly adding new medical devices, ventilators, and the like, to their network at a frenetic pace, equipment at risk for cybersecurity compromise,\" said Emmanuel Jackson, Founder & CEO, Evanston Technology Partners (ETP), a certified, Minority Business Enterprise.\nHealthcare delivery organizations globally have been challenged historically with the ever-increasing demand of connected medical devices that are in need of continuous management; add a global pandemic into the mix and the risk is exacerbated exponentially. As Ralph Ramsey, Global Associate Partner at IBM Security Services for Healthcare and Life Sciences, states \"the combination of cyber threats and lack of situational awareness has created the perfect storm atop of what will inevitably be a huge lesson learned for many healthcare organizations. Not only in managing the next crisis, but the role of enabling technologies that will be relied on in a variety of public health emergencies.\"\nA consequence of meeting the COVID-19 pandemic at such a rapid pace is that government officials and healthcare organizations are unable to balance demand, cybersecurity and the inventory management of all the new devices being added daily. \"This absolutely has an effect on saving lives given the shortage of life-saving equipment that must be deployed to the next hot-spot,\" Ramsey added.\n\"During a crisis, the private sector, cities, and states need to work together to get devices and resources to the areas of most need. It is critical to have a comprehensive management solution of network-connected devices that will assist healthcare organizations in tracking inventory, as well as allowing organizations to assess their device capabilities and security posture,\" said Tremayne Smith, Chief Information Security Officer at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. \"Being able to secure and easily share information from these systems, as we have learned to do with electronic health records, will allow us to support our communities and save lives, which should be the ultimate goal during an emergency response.\"\nThese risks and consequences propelled leading hospital systems to approach Evanston Technology Partners to develop what today is being announced today as the Healthcare Asset Operations Center (HAOC) Solution.\nETP's Healthcare Asset Operations Center (HAOC), powered by IBM and Cylera, will provide a comprehensive overview of the availability and security of network-connected healthcare assets and medical equipment, following the guidelines of the CDC's Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Capabilities. The HAOC will help healthcare providers effectively manage and maintain these critical medical devices and resources to prepare and respond to medical surge events, such as the ongoing COVID- 19 pandemic.\n\"Healthcare organizations are challenged with enormous visibility and security gaps during the COVID-19 response given increased patient care needs, medical device requirements and the growth of targeted threat actors looking to take advantage of the current situation. Hospitals not only need actionable operational intelligence, but they also want the means to efficiently monitor their environment to the minute and dynamically respond to any changes,\" said Timur Ozekcin, Co-founder and CEO at Cylera. \"A unified solution provides the best of multiple approaches to solve a broad range of operational and cybersecurity issues during the COVID-19 crisis and beyond.\"\nThe HAOC solution is designed to safely and remotely provide hospitals real-time operational intelligence, inventory monitoring, and cybersecurity of critical medical devices and equipment which are of vital need during a public health emergency. These medical devices include ventilators, infusion pumps, imaging devices and laboratory equipment. The HAOC enables bidirectional situational awareness between public health agencies and healthcare providers to help identify and eliminate inefficiencies around unused or underutilized assets. Thus, allowing comprehensive management across distributed locations to securely facilitate effective preparedness and response while minimizing roadblocks to patient treatment.\nThe HAOC solution is available now.\nEvanston Technology Partners has developed financing models with our partners to offer financing and delayed payments of 3 to 12 months.\nABOUT EVANSTON TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS\nEvanston Technology Partners (ETP) is a cybersecurity services company.

Fauci described the circumstances as challenging. \u201cCompanies that have the skill to be able to do it are not going to just sit around and have a warm facility, ready to go for when you need it,\u201d Fauci said, speaking on a panel Tuesday hosted by the Aspen Institute and moderated by STAT\u2019s Helen Branswell.\nFauci said it would be at least a year before a coronavirus vaccine would be available. However, that timeline assumes a large pharmaceutical manufacturer does step up to help make the product.\nThe vaccine being developed by the NIH and Moderna uses mRNA technology and is being funded by the Oslo, Norway-based Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. CEPI is funding three other efforts to develop a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. None of those partners, however, have the kind of commercial facilities that major pharmaceutical makers have and that would be capable of making the product in bulk.\nJohnson & Johnson has announced it is interested in developing its own coronavirus vaccine. On Tuesday, the company\u2019s vaccine division, Janssen, said it would partner with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services to develop that vaccine.\nIn a statement, the agency\u2019s director, Rick Bright, said \u201cspeed is crucial to saving lives and reducing further spread of the virus. Janssen is a proven partner with a flexible, rapid, vaccine platform.\u201d\nMajor drug makers, including Merck and GlaxoSmithKline, have stepped in to manufacture vaccines for previous public health emergencies. The vaccine against Ebola recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration and European regulators was manufactured by Merck.\nAt other times, however, companies have responded in public health crises to develop vaccines, only to have those crises fade and to be left with the enormous sunk costs of having to develop products for which there was no longer a market.\n\u201cWhen we were doing this with Ebola, it was a major vaccine company that got burned who\u2019s now pulling out of that,\u201d Fauci added, without naming the company. \u201cIt is going to be a challenge to be able to get a major company to do that.\u201d\nSpeaking alongside Fauci at the event was Ron Klain, who served as Ebola czar in the Obama administration and who echoed concerns that drug makers may be wary of getting involved again.\n\u201cI don\u2019t work for the companies, I\u2019m not like a drug company fan,\u201d Klain said, \u201cbut there\u2019s no question that a lot of them lost a lot of money trying to produce an Ebola vaccine.\u201d\nThis story was originally published by STAT, an online publication of Boston Globe Media that covers health, medicine, and scientific discovery.

        "content": "Based SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody Test with Time to First Result of 14 Minutes By HospiMedica International staff writers Posted on 24 Apr 2020 Image: Siemens\u2019 Atellica Solution immunoassay analyzer (Photo courtesy of Siemens Healthineers) Siemens Healthineers (Erlangen, Germany) has developed a laboratory-based total antibody test to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood. The test, which detects both IgM and IgG, has demonstrated specificity and sensitivity of greater than 99%. The total antibody test will provide a clear view of a patient\u2019s disease progression by identifying individuals infected with the virus who have developed an immune response to the virus, even if they were asymptomatic or never diagnosed with the disease. The test will add to Siemens\u2019 robust diagnostics portfolio currently aiding in the prognosis, treatment and follow up of COVID-19 patients, such as its molecular Fast Track Diagnostics (FTD) SARS-CoV-2 test kit. The test will be available on Siemens\u2019 Atellica Solution immunoassay analyzer, which can run up to 440 tests per hour2 and will enable a result in just 14 minutes. In addition, the serology test also is expected to be available on the company\u2019s expansive installed base of ADVIA Centaur XP and XPT analyzers, which deliver up to 240 tests per hour, with a result in 18 minutes. The availability of this test on these industry leading platforms will ensure more patients are tested in a shorter time. Siemens anticipates availability of the total antibody test by late May 2020. The planned expanded production in the company\u2019s manufacturing facility in Massachusetts, USA will accommodate more than 25 million tests per month in June and beyond. The company is pursuing Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well as the CE Mark. Comparable tests for Siemens Dimension Vista and Dimension EXL systems will also be pursued in the coming weeks to further expand clinical reach. In addition, the company intends to develop an IgG test to provide flexibility for testing needs as the pandemic evolves. \u201cSiemens Healthineers is working diligently to address the need for high-quality tests in the fight against COVID-19. This test is being designed with the precision and controls, sensitivity and specificity that laboratories have come to expect from our immunoassay tests,\u201d said Deepak Nath, PhD, President, Laboratory Diagnostics, Siemens Healthineers. \u201cI am especially proud of the dedication of our colleagues involved in development of this test\u2014many of whom are based at the epicenter of the pandemic.\u201d ",

        "content": "CORONA-VIRUSES; HISTORY,CAUSES,SYMPTOM,TREATMENT,VACCINE,PRECAUTION,THREATS By PROF WAQAR HUSSAIN\n Corona virus emerged in Wuhan city of China in December 2019 and within a month, it spread profusely, infecting about three thousands people and killing 80.The plight of 110 million population of Wuhan is deplorable where hospital are teeming with patients and medical stores have run short of medicine,death is reigning and panic has gripped the entire area.People have stored food items and hidden in their homes.Apart from China, the Corona virus has crossed the boundaries and has entered in 20 countries.By each passing day, Corona fever is becoming pandemic and its fear is hanging like sword of Damocles over the entire global population.As there is no vaccine available to combat the Corona virus so there is Hobson's choice to keep away from it and this is only possible by knowing the details of Corona virus and precautionary measures.\n Corona fever is caused by a group of corona virus of f amily Coronaviridae.It cause disease in bird, mammals, and man. In human, corona virus causes respiratory infection often mild and rarely acute and lethal. Corona is a Latin word meaning crown, when virus is observed under electron microscope; a fringe of large bulbous surface projection create an image of royal crown. Corona-viruses were first discovered in 1960s in chicken and two type of virus in human; suffering from influenza. There are many types of viruses that have been identified so far ; For example, SARS.CoV in 2003; HCoV NL63 in 2004; HKU1 in 2005; MERS-CoV in 2012 and 2019 nCoV in 2019. Most causes respiratory track infection.\n In recent Corona virus crisis, a novel strain of Corona-virus 2019 nCoV was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China. Wuhan is a city with 110 million population. So far 25 death have been reported and 547 confirmed cases.National Health Commission daily report of 26th, Janauary says 2744 cases and 80 deaths. Wuhan virus has 70% genetic similarity with SARC-CoV. It is suspected that this virus originated from snakes or bat.Out of the first 41 people infected; two -third had link with Huanan Seafood whole sale market , which also sold live animals. It shoes that virus probably transmitted from animals. Other countries that have confirmed cases are: Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong , United States, Singapore, France, Nepal, Sri lanka, Cambodia,Australia, Malaysia, Canada,UK( WHO did not confirm it)\n Virus enter cell and virus particle is uncoated and RNA genome enter cytoplasm. Genome attaches to ribosome for translation. RNA genome make new copies using host cell machinery,thus increase in number. Its incubation period is for 2-14 days. There are two test to identity corona virus; first one is PCR Nucleic Acid Testing in which DNA of virus is detected. Second is \"crown morphology\" of corona virus is seen through Electron Microscope.The Minister of state for Health Zafar Mirza admitted that we have not enough facilities to identify and screen corona virus.So, we must be extra careful and should adopt measures to keep it at a bay.\n As far as ts treatment is concerned ,no vaccine is available so far . Suspected person is advised to wear mask. US CDC prescribed that patient should take flue medication, drink fluid and take rest.When its vaccine will come in market?This questions peeps in every mind. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH (NIH) is hooping for human trial of medicine by April 2020. Chinese Centre of Disease Control and Prevention CCDC has started developing vaccine against noval Coronovirus. Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovation ( CEPI) is funding three vaccine projects and hope to have a vaccine by jun 2020.So, at this stage, \"precaution\" is the best \"vaccine\"..\n Its symptom includes;Fever, coughing, breathing difficulty,in sum, flu like manifestation.Precautions are the more viable and practical solution to keep safe.It incledes: Regular hand washing; covering mouth and nose as it is air born disease ( spread by air); avoid close contact with person showing respiratory illness as it is contagious disease( spread by touch); doctor should use bunny suit (protective clothing from head to toe); keep away from pet animals; cook food completely especially meat or eat fruit and vegetables; avoid touching eye,nose or face of anyone; put vicks or oil in nose and try to breath through nose;keep moistened throat; and avoid catching flue.\nAnother question that comes in mind is about its mortality rate? China say 4% patient dies; WHO say 25% get serious illness; and most of the neutral observers have calculated mortality rate of 10%.It means one out of ten kick the bucket and nine get well.\n There is a looming threat about its colossal damage.Dr Sallaudin Qadri said that any virus can become pandemic if four factors are available.If it is a new type of virus; it can be transmitted from animal to human; human body can develop a disease and virus can spread from human to human. Unfortunately, all four factor are there.So, the world community should fight it on war footing. Pakistan is said to have five cases; three(Chines) in Services Hospital Lahore and two in Nishtar Hospital Multan. But these cases are not officially confirmed.But it is imminent need of the time to first screen the people coming from china from all corridors; air port, sea port and land route. Second, a massive awareness campaign is to be launched in print,electronic media and social media.Third if there is any confirmed case, he should be kept in quarantine. But one fact should be kept in mind, it is winter season and one often gets flue but every person getting cold should not be labelled with Corona virus before proper investigation.As anxiety of disease worsen the malady many fold. There is formula in medicine; two and two is not four, it is twenty two.It means if one get sick and then get anxious about it, the disease will not be in tune of 4 but it will increase to 22 . Further there is maxim: 'cat has nine lives\" meaning it is difficult to kill a cat, being tough.But in another adage, it is said:\" care killed a cat\" . It shows how dangerous it is anxiety that it killed sturdy nine lives having cat.So avoiding worry and anxiety is also a \"treatment.\"\n",

        "content": "Last week, the World Health Organization said it may take 1\u200c8 months to get the corona virus vaccine for widespread use. First, we must understand the characteristics and behavior of the virus on the host body.\nLet\u2019s find out why it takes so much time, despite the worldwide community\u2019s efforts to produce the vaccine.\nSince the first half of January, China has fully shared information about the RNA sequence of this virus, from which the whole world began to research and develop vaccines.\nIn late January, the virus was first successfully cultivated outside of China, at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia. This is an important step, because for the first time researchers in other countries have access to a live virus sample. Thanks to this, they began to understand the characteristics of the virus, which is another important step in the development of vaccines.\nSo far, it takes 2 to 5 years to develop vaccines. But with global efforts, as well as lessons learned from previous corona vaccine developments, the researchers hope to develop this vaccine in a much shorter time.\nWhy do we need to cooperate?\nNot only one research institute has the capacity and equipment to develop a vaccine.\nFirst, we must understand the characteristics and behavior of viruses on the host (human).\nNext, we have to prove that the test vaccine is safe and that we can create the right immunity of the body, not the wrong immunity that harms the body. Only then can the pre-clinical experiments be started on animals.\nVaccines that have been pre-clinical tested successfully will be tested by other institutions capable of testing the human body.\nIt will be decided by who, where to proceed. In general, it is best to test these vaccines in areas where outbreaks are occurring.\nFinally, if a vaccine is judged safe and effective, it will need to be legally approved. Then there must be a cost-effective way to produce the vaccine so that it is ready to be distributed.\nEach of the aforementioned steps of the vaccine development process presents many challenges.\nSome challenges\nIn order to determine the characteristics of the virus, then the preclinical test vaccine trial first needs to isolate the virus, followed by cultivating a larger amount of virus so that the scientists have enough virus for further research . This includes virus culture in the laboratory under security and aseptic conditions.\nThe next challenge is to develop and validate virus biological samples. This will be an animal model that tells us how corona virus works in the human body.\nFrom the results of the SARS outbreak in 2003, which is a \"family\" of the new corona virus, the scientists have a lot of experience to study this virus. For SARS, the researchers used the ferret-model animal as the experimental biological model. The two new strains of SARS and corona virus have the same gene codes of about 80 - 90%, so the ferret test results can be used as a starting point for further study of the new corona virus.\nIf the virus mutates, what will the vaccine do?\nIt is very likely that the new corona virus will evolve (mutate). As a virus in an animal\u2019s body, it can mutate when it spreads from the first animal host to the next host, then spreads from animals to humans.\nInitially it was not spread from person to person, but now it is spread from person to person very quickly. Spread from person to person demonstrates that the virus is undergoing a stable step, which is part of the mutation process.\nMutation processes can still change in different parts of the world for a variety of reasons. One of the reasons is population density. Population density affects the number of people infected with the virus and the number of chances for the virus to mutate. Exposure to other corona viruses may also affect the ability of the population to infect, resulting in the emergence of different strains of the virus, similar to the condition of seasonal flu.\nTherefore, it is essential that we continue to work with the latest versions of the virus to have the greatest chance that the vaccine will work.\nAll this work needs to be done under strict quality and safety conditions to ensure global legal requirements and safety for researchers as well as the community.\nChallenges ahead\nAnother challenge is producing proteins from viruses to develop experimental vaccines. These proteins are specifically designed to enable an immune response when activated, allowing a person\u2019s immune system to fight the next time the virus is attacked.\nFortunately, recent scientific advances in understanding the viral proteins as well as their structure and function have helped the vaccine research and development work take place globally at a rapid pace. significantly fast.\nDeveloping a vaccine is a huge task, not an overnight result. But if everything goes according to plan, this time we will shorten the time compared to before.\nWe have learned a lot from the SARS outbreak, and the knowledge of the global scientific community gained from SARS vaccination efforts has given us a good start to developing vaccines. Please prevent new corona virus this time.",

        "content": "The death of the Chinese doctor, who tried to warn against an outbreak of the Corona virus, has sparked an unprecedented wave of popular anger and sadness in China. Li Wenliang died of being infected with the Coronavirus, which he contracted while treating patients in the central hospital in Wuhan, China, the center of the virus's spread. Wenliang sent a letter in December to his colleagues in the medical field, warning of a virus that was thought to be the SARS virus. But the police were instructed to \"stop publishing false comments\" and were investigated for \"spreading rumors.\" The news of Wenliang's death was greeted by a torrent of grief on the Chinese social networking site Weibo - but that grief soon turned into anger. Wireless Mouse Notebook Computer Business to Wired Gaming-Mouse Mice PC Laptop US $10.89-40% buy now US $6.53 https://megabonus.com/y/51Rjw\nThe Chinese government is facing charges of underestimating the seriousness of the virus and trying to cover up its spread. Doctor Wenliang's death sparked these accusations and sparked talk of a lack of freedom of expression in China. The China Anti-Corruption Commission said it will open an investigation into a number of cases, \"including that of Doctor Wenliang\". The Chinese government had previously admitted to \"deficiencies\" in its handling of the virus, which has so far killed 636 people and infected 31,161 throughout China. According to a local news website, Wenliang's wife will give birth in June. Corona virus: a race against time to develop a vaccine Corona virus: how does it affect the body? What was the reaction of the Chinese fans? Chinese social media has caught on with anger at the government to a degree that the country has never seen in recent years. \"Wuhan government owes Dr. Li Wenliang an apology\" and the label \"We want freedom of expression,\" topped the label. However, these two markings were soon subject to censorship. When the BBC conducted a search on WIPO on Friday, hundreds of thousands of comments had been deleted, leaving only a few remaining. Commenting on a Weibo website, one of them wrote: \"We are not about the death of a person who has reported wrongdoing. We are talking about a hero.\" How was the death announced The exact moment of Dr. Wenliyang's death is shrouded in mystery, but the first time that government media windows announced his death was yesterday, 13:30 GMT. But one of those windows that announced his death came back and said that Wenliang was placed on life support devices from outside the body, which helped keep the pulse running. Informed journalists and doctors said government officials intervened and instructed the official media to change their sayings and say instead that Doctor Wenliyang was still undergoing treatment. But early Friday, it was reported that the doctors had not been able to save Wenliyang and that he had died at 02:58 am. What did Wenliang do? On December 30, ophthalmologist Wenliang sent a message to his colleagues during a group chat on a Chinese communication, warning them of the virus outbreak, and advised them to wear protective clothing to avoid infection. What Wenliang did not know at the time was that the illness he was talking about was the Coronavirus. Wenliang was working at the outbreak in December when he noticed seven cases he had first suspected of being infected with the SARS virus - which struck a global epidemic in 2003. Four days later, officials from the Public Security Bureau visited him and asked him to sign a letter stating his accusation of \"making incorrect comments\" that resulted in \"a serious disruption of public order.\" Wenliang posted his story on Weibo, describing how he had suffered from a cough on January 10, before he developed a fever and was taken to hospital where he was diagnosed with the Corona virus on January 30. What is the situation in China and around the world? On Friday morning, Chinese President Xi Jinping told his US counterpart Donald Trump that China is \"fully confident and capable of defeating the epidemic.\" China has taken more stringent measures to try to control the outbreak of the virus. The capital, Beijing, banned group banquets at parties such as birthdays and others. Other Chinese cities have restricted the number of family members allowed to leave the house daily. ",

Industry prioritise health of crew and members\nGuy Platten, the Secretary General of ICS commented:\n\u201cThe shipping industry will always prioritise the health of our crew and members of the public above all else. We have recommended that all our members across the world follow the WHO measures. As an industry, we fully understand the importance of playing our role in halting the spread of viruses.\u201d\n\u201cBy implementing the measures in their entirety, we are avoiding the needless closure of any port. Shipping can continue to be the conduit for 90% of world trade, ensuring the steady supply of medicine, food and fuel for consumers worldwide. We are thankful that the WHO has avoided a knee jerk reaction, which would do nobody any favours.\u201d\nAdvice provided to shipowners highlights the need for: Exit screening at ports in the affected areas to detect symptomatic travellers and prevent the exportation of the disease. This includes checking for signs and symptoms and keeping confirmed cases under isolation and treatment. Implementing health information campaigns to raise awareness on how to receive assistance if someone is showing symptoms. Collaborating with public health authorities for case management on board ships, should a traveller with symptoms be detected. ICS in safeguarding public health\nThe ICS takes its responsibilities on safeguarding public health extremely seriously. It has shared WHO guidelines to its members on how best to reduce the possibility of the spread of 2019-nCov.\nResults of following the guidelines\nThe trade body has urged all members to fully adopt the guidelines. Doing so avoids the unnecessary closure of ports, that facilitate 90% of global trade, including the transportation of medicines that underpin the health industry, as well as food and fuel supplies.\nShould the WHO recommendations change with the closure of specific ports for medical reasons, we would recommend that the port in question and shipowners follow this advice.

Screening points have been set up at all major ports of entry. Every aspect of the system is highly functional and this is not a condition from within, so it should be easier to deal with,\u201d he said.",

A medical professional sprays disinfectant into the air while transporting a patient in Tijuana in a photo provided anonymously to KPBS in April 2020.\nIn March, the Mexican government insisted that Mexico would be spared the worst of the coronavirus pandemic because of its to its early implementation of social distancing.\nBut as the weeks passed, and California\u2019s own curve flattened, the situation in Tijuana has become dire and deadlier than the situation in San Diego.\nAs of Friday, 110 people have died in Tijuana. Across the state of Baja California, 163 people are now dead from the virus. Yesterday was the deadliest day in Baja, 37 people died. The number of infected continues to rise, with 1,161 confirmed coronavirus cases in Baja California. The city of Ensenada is now on almost total lockdown.

There are currently just 10 ventilators still available in Tijuana.\nA hospital worker in Tijuana sent KPBS a note describing conditions at Clinica Veinte, which has seen a huge influx of COVID-19 patients and is now building a tent to handle the overflow. She says officials are being very secretive about the true number of patients, and that she\u2019s sure people have died while waiting for ventilators.\nTijuana is a huge producer of ventilators and other medical equipment, but much of that equipment is sent abroad, leading to conflict between Baja California Gov.

Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames. \n\nUnder global trade law, Mexico is prohibited from buying many of the products it makes before they\u2019re shipped abroad.\nThat has changed somewhat in recent days, after Bonilla threatened to shut down factories that weren\u2019t contributing somewhat to Mexican efforts to handle the virus.\nBut with Mexican factories along the border playing a central part in the global supply chain, and workers there continuing to fall ill during the pandemic, every day Mexico\u2019s factories remain open and without necessary safety precautions, is another day that the pandemic worsens in the country.\nDoctors there, many already sickened, fear that the situation, already critical, will soon overwhelm the country\u2019s hollowed-out health care system.",

This is accompanied by concrete recommendations to the more than 190 member countries in order to limit the spread as far as possible. So far, more than 8,100 people worldwide have been infected, most of them in China.\nWHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus thanked the Chinese authorities for their exemplary handling of the virus at the announcement of the decision in Geneva and emphasized that the step should not be understood as a vote of no confidence in China.\nThe number of infections outside of China is still relatively low, said Tedros. But you don\u2019t know what damage the virus would do in a country with a poor health system. The main worry is that the virus could spread to such countries. Last week, the WHO had refrained from classifying the outbreak as an international health emergency.\nThis is the time for facts, not fear.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in the same boat,\u201d said Tedros. The virus can only be stopped together. \u201cThis is the time for facts, not fear.\u201d\nAmong other things, the WHO now recommends that countries with less developed health systems should be supported. In addition, the work on drugs and vaccines should be accelerated, knowledge and data shared and rumors should be dealt with. At the same time, the WHO does not recommend any restrictions on trade and travel.\nWHO members are obliged to coordinate their measures. \u201cIf each country imposes its own measures, this can be the recipe for disaster \u2013 for example, economically,\u201d said WHO emergency coordinator Michael Ryan. WHO is given special competencies, but its recommendations are not legally binding.

With 317 new diseases reported by the authorities in the severely affected province of Hubei in central China on Thursday, the total number rose to more than 8100 worldwide.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, 8096 people fell ill and 774 died of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in 2002/2003. The new virus, which is related to the Sars pathogen, has so far killed 170 people.\nThe number of people demonstrably infected with the new virus rose rapidly to more than 8,100 worldwide. Two weeks ago, only 40 cases were counted.

        "content": "German version News of the corona virus epidemic is currently making it into the press before the coal phase-out and the impeachment proceedings against the US president. The World Health Organization is discussing the declaration of a worldwide health emergency so as not to be accused of having acted too hesitantly and belatedly - as in the case of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014. The Chinese health authorities lock down more than 40 Million citizens in their cities and cancel the most important new year holidays to show that they have everything under control and, above all, that they are working transparently, responsible and cooperatively, in contrast to the SARS virus outbreak in 2003.\nThe virologists are giving long interviews about similarities and differences to the SARS virus with many \"could\", \"if\" and \"must\" formulations, with which they above all testify to their own importance, since they can no more predict the course of events than the German Robert Koch Institute, whose task at the moment is to reassure the German public that everyone is prepared and nobody needs to worry. Even as very few cases have been detected in Europe and Germany now, the whole thing is still taking place mainly in the \"Far East\". But thanks to globalization, the perceived distances have apparently shrunk, as has the time lag between an event and its media presentation.\nWhat a new epidemic promises It seems that everyone is rushing to catch this new infectious disease, already announced as a \"pandemic\", to forget for a moment the climate crisis, the Libyan crisis and the Brexit crisis. And all the players have their own interests at stake. A new epidemic promises new research funds, new resources for vaccines and medicines development, new prevention activities, new jobs and new experts panels and conferences, and a welcome change from the often boring and tedious routines of everyday work for a functioning healthcare system. This, however, should actually be exactly what it is all about: strengthening the daily work of the health system so that all people in need can be helped in case of need.\nIf always an emergency has to be declared first, so that the question of continuous monitoring of health hazards comes up, at some point nobody believes that surveillance should be part of the routine tasks (and cannot be delegated to a \"rapid reaction force\") to prepare a health system for such situations. And if only one \"new\" virus triggers the alarm, the scandal of the avoidable victims of well-known killers such as measles or tuberculosis becomes smaller and smaller - as currently shown by the comparison between the 6,000 confirmed fatalities of the measles outbreak in the DR Congo since 2019 and the 132 current deaths caused by the new corona virus globally, most of them in the 11 million metropolis of Wuhan.\nThe daily management of global health threats is neglected WHO currently complains of acute \"donor fatigue\" in the fight against measles in Congo and lists weak health systems, logistical difficulties and malnutrition of the population as co-factors of the epidemic. Here sits the dilemma of such \"disaster health policy\", as it is currently evident in the Corona case: in the simulation of an activist system of global health security policy that prioritizes events because this allows attention, resources and significance to be mobilized while neglecting the day-to-day management of global health threats.\nIf global (and also German) health policy was really serious about its commitment to universal health coverage, then the difference would have to be made here: Despite all the necessary attention to potential global health threats, today more than ever it is a matter of structurally strengthening local basic health systems, which are also necessary to cope with epidemics in an emergency. This was demonstrated in the Ebola crisis in West Africa, and it will be shown again if the corona virus proves to be much more dangerous than it fortunately still looks at present.\n\"Pandemics teach us that all human beings are born equal and therefore mortal in the same way. In line with this, the danger of a global pandemic can only be averted if the concept of \"health for all\" is finally realized and the simple truth is recognized everywhere in the world that every public health system is only as strong as its poorest patient\".\nFrom: The host is always the stranger of Satya Sivaraman. The journalist, author and filmmaker lives in different places in South and Southeast Asia and is media consultant of the \"People's Health Movement\".",

        "content": "Death toll rises again, China begins drug trials Corona virus outbreak explains: Death toll rises again, China begins drug trials Google + Robert Rodriguez / CNET China has been fighting the outbreak of pneumonia that was first found in downtown Wuhan in December 201 9 for over a month. The flood of diseases is caused by a novel corona virus called 2019-nCoV, which has now infected over 34,000 Chinese citizens and has claimed more than 720 lives. The disease was first reported on New Year's Eve and in the World Health Organization. The interim month was associated with a family of viruses known as \"coronaviruses\", with the same family, which is responsible for SARS and the respiratory syndrome in the vicinity East as well as some cases of cold is responsible.\nThere are no approved treatments for coronaviruses, but on February 6, China enrolled a small number of patients in a clinical trial with Remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug from the American pharmaceutical company Gilead that has not yet been approved for use but proved to be promising in laboratory studies. \"While there is currently no antiviral data for remdesivir showing activity against 2019-nCoV, the data available in other coronaviruses gives us hope,\" Gilead said in a statement.\nOn January 30, a special WHO committee declared an emergency in the area of \u200b\u200bpublic health to be internationally worrying. Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed outside of China, including the United States, where leading agencies around the world are beginning to restrict travel and enforce quarantines to prevent the spread.\nOn February 4, two well-known telephone manufacturers announced that they would change their plans at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, \u200b\u200bwhich begins on February 24 . LG will withdraw from the exhibition and attend while the Chinese company ZTE holds a press conference scheduled for the show.\nOn February 5, Chinese state media reported that a newborn was diagnosed with 2019-nCoV only 30 hours after birth. Unlocking the potential for mother-child transmission. Viruses can be transmitted across the placenta, but experts say it is too early to say whether this is the case with the novel corona virus, which is \"unlikely\" to be transmitted in the womb.\nOn February 7, Li Wenliang, the 34-year-old Chinese doctor who talked about increasing cases of pneumonia in an online chat room in the early days of the outbreak, died from the effects of the 2019-nCoV infection.\nThe situation is developing rapidly. We've put together everything we know about the novel virus, what's next for researchers, and what steps you can take to reduce your risk.\nNow Playing: Deadly Corona Virus Detected in the United States\n1:41 What is a corona virus?\nCoronaviruses belong to a family known as Coronaviridae and look like spiked rings under an electron microscope. They are named after these spines, which form a halo or \"crown\" around their viral envelope.\nCoronaviruses contain a single strand of RNA in the envelope and cannot multiply as a virus without penetrating living cells and hijacking their machinery. The spikes on the virus envelope help corona viruses bind to cells, which gives them a way to open the door with C4. Inside, they transform the cell into a virus factory and use their molecular conveyor belt to produce more viruses, which are then transported out of the cell. The virus progeny infect other cells and the cycle starts again.\nThese types of viruses typically occur in animals, which range from farm animals and domestic animals to wild animals such as bats. Some are responsible for diseases like colds. When jumping to people, they can cause fever, respiratory problems, and inflammation in the lungs. In immunocompromised people, such as the elderly or people with HIV-AIDS, such viruses can cause serious respiratory diseases that lead to pneumonia and even death.\nExtremely pathogenic coronaviruses have been outbreaks of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome) in the past two decades. These viruses were easily transmitted from person to person. SARS, which occurred in the early 2000s, infected more than 8,000 people and resulted in nearly 800 deaths. MERS, which emerged in the early 2010s, infected nearly 2,500 people and resulted in more than 850 deaths. Where did the virus come from?\nThe virus appears to have its origins in Wuhan, a Chinese city about 950 kilometers south of Beijing, where more than 11 million people live. The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sells fish as well as meat from other animals, including bats, snakes, and pangolins, was involved in the spread in early January.\nThe renowned medical journal The Lancet published a comprehensive summary of the clinical features of patients infected with the disease, which date back to December 1, 2019. The very first patient identified was not exposed to the market, suggesting that the virus may have come from another place and was marketed there.\nChinese authorities closed the fish market on January 1.\nMarkets have been involved in the emergence and spread of viral diseases in previous epidemics, including SARS and MERS. A large majority of people who have confirmed that they are infected with the new corona virus have been in the Huanan Seafood market in recent weeks. The market appears to be an integral part of the puzzle, but researchers continue to test and research the original cause.\nIn an early report published on January 22 in the Journal of Medical Virology, snakes were suspected to be the most likely wildlife reservoir for 2019-nCoV, but the work was stopped only a day later on January 22 January, thoroughly refuted by two other studies Here is a study that refutes the evidence for the snake as a #Coronavirus reservoir. Suspected that the closest coronavirus relatives are found in bats (bats were also seen as a reservoir for SARS in 2003).  \"We haven't seen enough evidence to point to a snake reservoir for the Wuhan corona virus (2019- nCoV), \"said Peter Daszak, president of the non-profit EcoHealth Alliance, which examines the relationships between human and animal health.\n\"This work is really interesting, but when we compare the genetic sequence of this new virus with all other known coronaviruses, all of the closest relatives are from mammals, especially bats. It looks like we haven't got any closer to the markets, to know the natural reservoir of this virus. \"\nAnother group of Chinese scientists uploaded a paper to the preprint website biorXiV after examining the viral genetic code and comparing it with the previous SARS corona virus and other bat corona viruses , They discovered the profound genetic similarities: the virus shares 80% of its genes with the previous SARS virus and 96% of its genes with bat coronaviruses. It is important that the study also showed that the virus can enter and kidnap cells in the same way as SARS.\nAll good scientific knowledge builds on previous discoveries \u2013 and there's still more to learn about the basic biology of 2019-nCoV before we know exactly which animal vector is responsible for transmission \u2013 but early signs are the virus similar to bats. A January 28 New York Times report suggested that the Chinese horseshoe bat could be a culprit. How many confirmed cases have been reported?\nThe authorities confirmed over 34,000 cases on February 7.\nIn the United States, 12 cases were confirmed: six in California, two in Illinois and one each in Washington, Wisconsin, Massachusetts and Arizona. Canada has four confirmed cases.\nA cruise ship stationed in front of the Japanese port of Yokohama was quarantined after it was found that a passenger traveling on board was infected with 2019-nCoV. On February 6, Japan confirmed that 61 people on the ship had tested positive for the novel corona virus.\nOver 27,000 people were suspected on February 7. According to CGTN a Chinese media service, the number of recovered patients in China has risen to over 2,000.\nHere is the current breakdown: China: 34,582 confirmed cases (Hong Kong: 26; Macau: 10) Singapore : 30 confirmed cases South Korea: 24 confirmed cases [19659041] Taiwan: 16 confirmed cases Australia: 15 confirmed cases USA: 12 confirmed cases [19659041] Malaysia: 12 confirmed cases Vietnam: 10 confirmed cases United Arab Emirates: 5 cases Canada: 5 confirmed cases India: 3 confirmed cases Cases Philippines: 3 confirmed cases Gro United Kingdom: 2 confirmed cases Italy: 2 confirmed cases Sri Lanka: 1 confirmed case Tibet: 1 confirmed case Sweden: 1 confirmed case Belgium: 1 confirmed case\nYou can use this practical online tool to track the spread of the virus . It collects data from various sources, including the CDC, WHO and Chinese health experts. (Note: Our reports and tracking tool may differ.) How many deaths have been reported?\nAs of February 7, the death toll was 724.\nOne death was recorded outside of China. A man who traveled to Wuhan in January and returned to the Philippines died on February 1. A second death outside of China was reported Tuesday after a 39-year-old man died in Hong Kong. How do we know that this is a new corona virus?\nIn short, science!\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention sent a team of scientists to Wuhan to collect information about the new disease and test it on patients in hopes of isolating the virus. Her work published in the New England Journal of Medicine on January 24, examined samples from three patients. Using an electron microscope that can resolve images of cells and their internal mechanics and examine the genetic code, the team was able to make the novel corona virus visible and genetically identify it.\nUnderstanding the genetic code helps researchers in two ways: it enables them to create tests that identify the virus from patient samples, and it gives them potential insight into how to create treatments or vaccines.\nIn addition, the Peter Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia, was able to identify and breed the virus in a laboratory using a patient sample. They announced their discovery on January 28th. This is considered one of the biggest breakthroughs in the development of a vaccine, giving laboratories the opportunity to assess health authorities and provide expert information, as well as to identify the virus in patients suspected of harboring the disease. How does the corona virus spread?\nThis is one of the main questions that researchers are still working hard to answer. The first infections may have been the result of an animal-to-human transmission, but it was confirmed in late January that human-to-human transmission had occurred.\nThe University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy reported that health workers in China had been infected with the virus in late January. This was a remarkable turning point during the SARS epidemic, as health workers who moved between countries could help spread the disease.\n\"The biggest problem is hospital outbreaks that have occurred with SARS and MERS corona viruses,\" said C. Raina MacIntyre, professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales. \"Careful triage and infection control is required to prevent these outbreaks and to protect health workers.\"\nAccording to a BBC report citing Chinese officials, there is some evidence that the virus can spread before symptoms appear . The incubation period \u2013 when the virus accumulates in the body \u2013 can last from one to 14 days without a patient realizing that he is infected. However, it must be emphasized that experts are still not sure how contagious this period is.\nOn February 5, Chinese state media reported that a newborn was diagnosed with nCoV 30 hours after birth in 2019, which opens up the possibility of mother-to-child transmission. Viruses can be transmitted through the placenta, but experts say it is too early to say whether this is the case with the novel coronavirus, which is \"unlikely\" to be transmitted in the womb. How does the world fight spread?\nIn Wuhan, authorities hurried to build a thousand-bed hospital to treat coronavirus patients as the province struggles with hospital bed shortages. It started admitting patients on February 4th.\nChina closed Wuhan to reduce the spread of the virus and canceled the transportation that left the city at 10:00 am on January 23. Travel restrictions were extended to four other cities (Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi and Zhijiang), and on January 24, eight other cities announced restrictions that affected more than 35 million people.\nRestrictions were enforced for China during a busy travel season, when citizens typically travel on Lunar New Year. Major Public Events The Chinese capital Beijing was canceled, and both the Forbidden City in Beijing and Disneyland in Shanghai were closed on January 25th. All restrictions and closings will apply indefinitely.\nThe scale of global efforts to contain the disease is immense . Hong Kong closed many public institutions on January 28, preventing travel between mainland China. The United States announced extensive border control measures at 20 ports of entry and was considering canceling flights to and from the Wuhan outbreak epicenter. Esports tournaments have been postponed, Shanghai and Hong Kong Disneyland have been closed, women's Olympic soccer tournaments have been postponed completely, and McDonald's has closed thousands of places across China where the virus is spreading.\nBritish Airways suspended all flights to and from mainland China \"for the next few days\" on January 29, a spokesman confirmed by email. American Airlines and Delta will also discontinue flight to mainland China, but Delta will be offering flights to customers wishing to leave China by February 5. Australian carrier Qantas announced that flights from Sydney to Beijing and Sydney to Shanghai will be discontinued on February 9. The New Zealand airline Air New Zealand discontinued daily flights to Shanghai on February 1st.\nCruise ships announced on February 7, Royal Caribbean that entry would be denied for \"all passport holders in China, Hong Kong and Macau regardless of their residence\". It is also impossible for anyone to travel to China, Hong Kong or Macau in the 15 days before boarding. and anyone who has come within two meters of someone from China, Hong Kong or Macau 15 days earlier; and everyone with fever or low blood oximetry. Norwegian Cruise Line will deny entry to anyone who has traveled to China, Hong Kong and Macau within 30 days of the cruise and anyone who has a passport from these locations.\nOn January 31, US Secretary of Health Alex Azar declared a public health emergency referring to the nation's intent to protect and respond to the outbreak while finding that \" the risk to Americans remains low. \"Australia and Japan followed. On February 4, the UK Department of State and French Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned citizens to evacuate China to reduce the risk of infection. How contagious is the corona virus?\nA widely used Twitter topic by Eric Feigl-Ding an epidemiologist at Harvard University, suggests that the new coronavirus is based on a metric poorly known as a \"thermonuclear pandemic level\"\"r nothing\" (R0) value. This metric helps determine the basic reproductive number of an infectious disease. In the simplest sense, the value refers to how many people can be infected with the disease by a person. It has been criticized many times before\nInfectious diseases such as measles have a remarkably high R0 value from 12 to 18. The SARS epidemic of 2002-2003 had an R0 of around 3. A handful of studies that modeled the outbreak of 2019-nCoV gave a similar value, with a range between 1.4 and 3.8, but there are large differences between studies and models trying to test the R0 of the novel coronavirus due to d he can predict constantly changing number of cases.\nIn the early stages of understanding and spreading the disease, it should be emphasized that these studies are informative but not final. They give an indication of the potential of the disease to move from person to person, but we still don't have enough information about how the new virus spreads.\n\"Some experts say it's the most infectious virus ever seen \u2013 that's not true,\" said MacIntyre. \"If it was highly contagious (more contagious than influenza, as suggested by some), we should have seen hundreds, if not thousands, of cases outside of China now that Wuhan is a major transportation hub.\"\nChina has suggested that the virus can spread before symptoms appear. In The Conversation of January 28, MacIntyre wrote that there was no evidence to support these claims, but that children and teenagers could be contagious without symptoms. This also reduces the impact of airport screenings, as the disease is native, but there is no evidence that it can spread insidiously. Should You Be Worried?\nAs the virus spreads, it is easy to get caught up in the fear and alarmism that is rife on social media. There is misinformation and misinformation about the effects of the disease where it spread and how. Experts are still warning that the virus appears to be mild, especially when compared to other viruses such as influenza or measles.\nCNET has reviewed some rumors and myths that have spread. WHO declares public health emergency\nOn January 30, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency that raised international concern about the outbreak of the coronavirus. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the organization is working with national and international health partners to manage the outbreak.\nThe WHO also issued recommendations to prevent the virus from spreading and to ensure a \"measured and evidence-based response\". \"To the people in #China and to everyone affected by this outbreak, we want you to know that the world is with you\"\u2013 @DrTedros # 2019nCoV\n\u2013 World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) January 30, 2020\nAn Emergency Committee on the Ebola Epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo met in the fall. Key strategies and commitments to strengthen and protect against the spread of the disease were presented at the meeting.\nOn Thursday, search giant Google announced that it would partner with WHO to help spread information about its results page. Today we started an SOS alert with @WHO to make resources about #coronavirus easily accessible. When users search for related information on @Google they'll find the notification on the results page with direct access to WHO security tips, information, resources, and Twitter updates.\n\u2013 Google Communications (@ Google_Comms) January 30, 2020 What are the symptoms?\nThe new coronavirus causes symptoms similar to the previously identified disease-causing coronaviruses. There appears to be a range of diseases in currently identified patients: a large number have mild pneumonia symptoms, while others have a much stronger response.\nAccording to the report, patients had: fever, increased body temperature.",

        "content": "While information about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is still being gathered, plenty of facts about what it is, what it can do and ways to prevent it exist. First detected in Wuhan, China, Americans began being diagnosed with it in January. Indications are that it is being spread by human contact and travelers who were evacuated from China have been observed for symptoms in several U.S. cities. People have been tested for the virus in many states. The possibility of transmitting or contracting the disease highlights the importance of prevention. It should be noted that by the end of January, only five cases had been confirmed in the United States. The risk to the general public in the U.S. was still considered low. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) predicted, however, that reported cases may increase although it is impossible to know to what extent.\nFacts about coronaviruses\nA coronavirus gets its name from a spike-like formation on the virus cells. \"Novel\" indicates that it has not previously been seen. Usually originating in animals, especially certain mammals and birds, the virus can be spread to humans through contact with them. Through direct contact, sneezing and coughing, a coronavirus can be spread from one human to another. Examples of coronaviruses in recent times include SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2003 and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) in 2012. There have been no reported cases of SARS since 2004 but MERS continues to be a threat in some countries including the United States. While SARS, MERS and 2019-nCoV are all coronaviruses, they have distinct differences.\nThe current 2019-nCoV is also a respiratory illness. It was first thought to have spread through contact between humans and animals in China. Further findings indicate that it is also being spread through human contact, even if the infected human did not have any animal contact.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus include fever, coughing and shortness of breath. Among confirmed cases, some symptoms were mild and others much more severe, even resulting in death.\nCDC estimates that symptoms could appear in as little time as two days or as much time as 14 days after someone has been infected.\nPrevention\nBy the end of January, no vaccine had been developed or determined effective to prevent someone from contracting 2019-nCoV. The recommended ways for individuals to reduce chances of becoming infected are the same that should be practiced to avoid catching and spreading the flu. These methods are especially timely since flu season is currently underway.\nSince viruses are spread by human contact, avoiding such contact is recommended. Sick people should not touch others or get close to them. Another common-sense methods is to cover the nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing. Hand washing and cleanliness are other effective ways to help prevent viruses from spreading. Hands should be washed for at least twenty seconds with soap. If soap and water are not available, hand sanitizers with alcohol content of at least sixty percent are recommended.\nTouching the nose and mouth increases the chances of the virus being spread. Avoiding doing so is recommended. Also, keeping home and work areas clean lessens the probability that germs will be spread. Disinfecting surfaces in these areas with strong cleaners will decrease chances for infection.\nSince the number of confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV by January's end was low in the United States, the focus was still on those who had traveled to China or had contact with someone who had traveled to China. If someone in either group develops symptoms, that person should be tested.\nTo learn more about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus and ways to prevent it, log on to vascularhealthclinics.org and visit the Infectious Disease Institute.\nAsk Dr. Haqqani\nIf you have questions about your cardiovascular health, including heart, blood pressure, stroke lifestyle and other issues, we want to answer them.

Of these cases, 37 were reported in 11 countries outside China.\n\"The current global case fatality rate of the 2019-nCoV is 2.9 percent, with all 80 deaths recorded in China,\" said Duque.\nReports from the Associated Press, however, revealed Tuesday that 1,771 new cases were confirmed on Monday, raising the national total to 4,515. Of the number, 976 were in serious condition.\nMore than 45 cases have also been confirmed elsewhere in the world, and almost all involve Chinese tourists or people who visited Wuhan.\nSri Lanka confirmed its first case Monday. Infections also have been confirmed in the United States, Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal, France, Canada and Australia.\nWith this, Duque said the World Health Organization has classified the risk level for the spread of the 2019-nCoV as very high in China, and high at the regional and global levels.\n\"We are closely monitoring the patients under investigation,\" he said, but stressed that there is still no confirmed case of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines.\nDuque also revealed during the press briefing Tuesday that during their Inter-Agency Committee meeting, members have agreed to ensure support for overseas Filipinos in China, as well as comprehensive transport and quarantine plans for overseas Filipinos from Hubei province who wish to voluntarily return to the Philippines.\nThe 2019-nCoV started in Wuhan in Hubei province in China and most of the cases are concentrated there. Reports said Wuhan is building two hospitals, one with 1,500 beds and another with 1,000, for the growing number of patients. The first is scheduled to be finished next week.\nDuque said the committee also agreed on proposing temporary restrictions on the issuance of visas for travelers from Hubei, and issuing advisories temporarily discouraging non-essential travel to China.\n\u201cI wish to inform our kababayans that the government will take care of you whether you choose to stay or return home. For those who choose to return, you will be taken care of in a health facility for monitoring and further medical management,\u201d he said.\nFor Filipinos who wish to stay in China, the DOH reiterated adherence to advisories and cooperation with public health activities being done by local authorities.\nDuque said the DOH will ensure that all Filipinos in other countries will receive sufficient information and health support through telemedicine.\n\u201cI urge the public to remain vigilant. Let us continue practicing good hand hygiene, observing proper cough etiquette, maintaining distance from people manifesting flu-like symptoms, cooking food properly, and adopting healthy lifestyles,\u201d he said.\nThe 2019-nCoV is from the coronavirus family that includes the common cold but also more severe illnesses like SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The new virus causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath and pneumonia.\nThe virus is thought to have spread to people from wild animals sold at a market in Wuhan. On Sunday, January 26, authorities banned trade in wild animals and urged people to stop eating meat from them. ",

        "content": "Gilead Sciences Inc said on Thursday that its focus is now on rapidly determining remdesivir's potential as a treatment for the 2019 novel coronavirus, rather than discussing compulsory licensing or any other kind of permissions for drug manufacturing.The comments came after the Wuhan Institute of Virology said on Wednesday that it had filed a patent application to use remdesivir to treat the novel coronavirus on January 21, which has sparked debate on China's social media about intellectual property issues.In response, Gilead Sciences said in an email sent to the Global Times on Thursday that the company has no right to intervene in approvals from China's patent agency, regardless of the Wuhan Institute of Virology's application. The company said it had filed patent applications for the drug's use on coronaviruses in China and some other countries and regions in 2016, but it has not yet received approval in China.Gilead Sciences developed remdesivir and owns patents for the experimental drug in China and other countries.\"The Wuhan Institute of Virology filed the patent application three years after Gilead's move, and thus the authorities will assess what has been known about the drug and patent applications in process,\" the company said.A manager of a domestic pharmaceutical company, which was once involved in an intellectual property (IP) dispute with a foreign company, told the Global Times that the Wuhan Institute of Virology had not violated IP rules as it had applied to use the drug's established functions to treat a new disease - the 2019 novel coronavirus.The manager said the institute's move should not be criticized as it will be beneficial for the common people amid the epidemic. Given that compulsory licensing practices are allowed under special conditions, filing for a patent to benefit the people during this coronavirus outbreak is acceptable, the manager said.After the SARS outbreak in 2003, China's Patent Law began to allow compulsory licensing practices - allowing others to produce patented products without the consent of the patent owner - when there is a key emergency in the country or for public interest. However, China has not done so over the past 16 years.\"It's too early to discuss compulsory licensing or any other kind of permissions at this time,\" Gilead Sciences said, noting that it has not discussed manufacturing costs or financial returns with Chinese authorities.The company said its focus is now on rapidly determining remdesivir's potential as a treatment for the 2019 novel coronavirus and accelerating manufacturing in anticipation of potential future supply needs.Remdesivir is not yet licensed or approved anywhere globally and it has not been demonstrated to be safe or effective for illness treatment.Clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of remdesivir for the treatment of patients infected with the coronavirus in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei Province, are being conducted from Thursday, the Xinhua News Agency reported.",

The people flown out of China on a plane chartered by the U.S. government have not been quarantined, Dr. Chris Braden of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters after the plane landed at March Air Reserve Base. Authorities said those evacuated, including U.S. consular employees based in the Chinese city of Wuhan and families with children, are technically not required to stay on the base. But all 195 passengers have agreed to stay for up to three days while they are evaluated for the illness that\u2019s infected thousands and killed more than 100, the CDC\u2019s Dr. Nancy Messonnier said. Officials initially said there were 201 passengers, but the CDC said later that number included the six members of the plane\u2019s crew. If any passengers decide they want to leave the base 60 miles (96 kilometers) east of Los Angeles before full medical evaluations are completed, U.S. officials would discuss their request, said Dr. Nancy Knight of the CDC. \u201cThey are sitting in the middle of a military base,\u201d Knight said. \u201cAny discussion around departure would be just that: it would be a discussion.\u201d Braden described people as being \u201cvery happy to be here,\u201d where they\u2019re getting housing, medical attention and testing for the virus. \u201cThey wanted to know their status,\u201d he said. Officials could quarantine any of those evacuated on a case-by-case basis if officials determine they need to do so, Braden said. It can take up to 14 days for someone who is infected to develop symptoms, health officials believe. If passengers from the chartered flight show no signs of the virus and leave the base, they will continue to be monitored by public health officials at their destinations for the remainder of a period lasting 14 days, he said. Symptoms of the virus include fever, cough and in more severe cases, shortness of breath or pneumonia. None of the passengers showed signs of having the virus when they were screened before leaving Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus, or when they were screened again during a refueling stop in Anchorage, Alaska. The jet landed at the California base shortly after 8 a.m. A ground crew dressed in white approached the aircraft, and three charter-style buses parked near the plane. About 40 minutes after landing, people could be seen walking from the plane to the first bus, which then departed. Another bus pulled up next to the plane\u2019s baggage compartment. All the passengers already underwent two health screenings in China and the CDC screened them twice more in Anchorage. One passenger received medical attention for a minor injury that happened before boarding the airplane in China, Dr. Anne Zink, Alaska\u2019s chief medical officer, told reporters after the plane left. Some of those expected on the flight from Wuhan were not allowed to board because they did not have documents they needed to enter the U.S., Braden said. One person with a fever also was denied boarding, he said. Wuhan is the epicenter of a new virus, which has largely sickened people in China and where all the deaths have been. China has cut off access to Wuhan and 16 other cities in Hubei province to prevent people from spreading the virus farther. In addition to the United States, countries including France, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have planned evacuations of their citizens from Wuhan .

The aim of the cooperation is to safely advance vaccine candidates into clinical testing as quickly as possible. The agreement will build on the existing partnership between CureVac and CEPI to develop a rapid-response vaccine platform and includes additional initial funding of up to $8.3 million by CEPI for accelerated vaccine development, manufacturing and clinical tests.\n\"CureVac's technology and mRNA platform are especially suitable to rapidly provide a response to a viral outbreak situation like this,\" said Dr. Mariola Fotin-Mleczek, Chief Technology Officer of CureVac. \"Thanks to the funding by CEPI, we will be able to support the fight against this health emergency in an expedited manner. Currently, we are in the process of developing a vaccine that, after successful preclinical tests, could be tested rapidly in humans in a clinical study.\"\nRichard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI, said: \"In view of the rapid spread of the coronavirus, CEPI has moved quickly to expand our collaboration with CureVac, so that we can apply their mRNA vaccine development platform to this disease. Our aspiration is to bring the pathogen's gene sequence to a vaccine candidate for clinical testing within a few months - which is significantly shorter than where we are now. This is an extremely ambitious timeline and even if we are successful-and there can be no guarantee-there will be further challenges to navigate before we can make vaccines widely available.\"\nIn addition, CureVac is working on the development of The RNA Printer . This is a mobile, automated production unit for rapid mRNA supply. In February, 2019, CEPI agreed to provide up to $34 million in support of this technology. This innovative platform will provide a rapid supply of lipid-nanoparticle (LNP)-formulated mRNA vaccine candidates that can target known pathogens (including Lassa Fever, Yellow Fever, and Rabies) and prepare for rapid response to new and previously unknown pathogens.\nThe Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) is one of the founding members of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and has committed a total of 90 million euro to its work. CEPI brings together a range of diverse stakeholders to develop much-needed vaccines for the prevention of future pandemics. Anja Karliczek, Federal Minister of Education and Research, said:\n\"The Coronavirus is currently the source of concern for many people. The development of a vaccine is an extremely important element in the effort to combat this viral infection. It is encouraging to see that this process now has the support of the international CEPI alliance, which is also making use of German research and development expertise. I hope that good results can soon be achieved for which so many people are waiting at this time.\"\nAbout CureVac's platform CureVac's platform aims to optimize the properties of mRNA therapeutics and vaccines. The technology can be tailored to induce varying degrees of immune responses against antigens of choice, potentially providing potent prophylactic vaccines for the prevention of infectious diseases, such as rabies, as well as immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. The technology can also be adapted to avoid such immune activation for purposes of molecular therapies, thereby providing potential new therapeutic modalities for patients suffering from rare diseases.\nAbout the novel coronavirus Coronavirusesare a family of viruses that can lead to respiratory illness, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Coronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people and can evolve into strains not previously identified in humans. On January 7, 2020, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the cause of pneumonia cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China, and additional cases have since then been found in a growing number of countries worldwide.\nCEPI's work on the novel coronavirus, nCoV-2019\nThe rapid global spread and unique epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus is deeply concerning. CEPI has moved with great urgency and in coordination with WHO, who is leading the development of a coordinated international response. We have initiated several partnerships to improve our understanding and to develop vaccines against the novel coronavirus. The programmes will leverage rapid response platforms already supported by CEPI as well as new partnerships. The aim is to advance nCoV-2019 vaccine candidates into clinical testing as quickly as possible.\nFollow our news page for the latest updates.\nAbout CureVac AG CureVac is a leading clinical stage biotechnology company in the field of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology with 20 years of expertise in developing and optimizing this versatile molecule for medical purposes.

        "content": "In 2002, the SARS outbreak surprised the world. The global response to 2019-nCoV has taken that lesson to heart Instapaper Ad\nAlmost 20 years ago, a never-before-seen virus hit the Guangdong province of China. This severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was caused by a virus of the same name: SARS-Coronavirus. By the end of the 2002-2003 outbreak , over 8,000 people were infected and 774 people died. Two decades later, we seem to be looking at the start of a very similar situation: a new virus has been discovered in Wuhan, China, and it is spreading throughout Asia and the world, with the USA confirming their first case on January 21st, 2020. While it is too early to determine the global outcome of this virus, there are many ways we have learned from the SARS outbreak to prepare us for novel coronavirus (currently named 2019-nCoV ).\nAvian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a poultry pathogen. Here you see the 'crown' that gives coronavirus its name.\nPhoto by CDC on Unsplash\nIn late December 2019, people in Wuhan began coming down with a pneumonia not associated with common causes like influenza. More severe causes, like SARS and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), were also ruled out. These new cases were all associated with the Hunan seafood market in Wuhan. On December 30th 2019, 27 cases of this \"Wuhan Pneumonia\" were announced, of which seven patients were in severe condition. On December 31st, the World Health Organization China Country Office was alerted to this atypical pneumonia and one day later, on January 1st 2020, the seafood market was shut down due to a concern around transmission from animals to humans.\nThis quick reaction is a stark contrast to the SARS epidemic. The first case of SARS occurred in November 2002 , yet the WHO didn\u2019t release an alert until March 2003 . China was scrutinized heavily for not releasing more information about the growing outbreak in 2002 and early 2003. This time is different. The ability to link 27 cases of pneumonia to one market reflects great planning and surveillance within Chinese hospitals and healthcare networks. The Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and School of Public Health and collaborators even released the sequenced genome of this virus on January 10th 2020, which led to the identification of nCOV as a betacoronavirus , placing it in the same genus as SARS and MERS. Rapid phylogenetic analysis of novel Wuhan China human Coronavirus shows it definitely clusters with the #SARS -related CoV clade. Note: prelim analysis based on 410bp of RdRp. More analyses forthcoming, but great to see seq data being shared by China. @EcoHealthNYC @PeterDaszak pic.twitter.com/M25hCOy5M1 \u2014 Kevin J Olival (@nycbat) January 11, 2020\nThe sharing of the sequence within two weeks of the WHO announcing an outbreak on unknown origin speaks to global cooperation, but also technological advances. The cost of gene sequencing has plummeted in the past 20 years , while the speed of sequencing has increased. Having the sequencing information helps clinicians develop lab tests against the virus' genome , and use that to be able detect the virus in patient samples. In the initial outbreak of SARS, healthcare professionals had no ability to confirm cases this way, and in the early days of the outbreak, patients were diagnosed through clinical symptoms only. The swift production of laboratory tests for 2019-nCoV will help public health agencies keep an eye on the spread of the disease as well as catch cases early. This has already been seen in the USA where they are screening individuals who are returning from Wuhan at three main airports to control the spread of the virus.\nIn order to help reduce the virus' spread, we also need to know where it comes from. Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that get their name from their \"crown\"-like appearance under an electron microscope. There are four coronaviruses that commonly circulate in humans. They cause one kind of the common cold. In very rare cases, these viruses are zoonotic, meaning they're transferred to humans from animals. This was seen in the SARS outbreak where humans were getting the virus directly from civet cats , an animal often sold in markets in Guangdong. During the 2002-2003 epidemic, the Chinese government called for a massive culling of civet cats to control the spread of SARS. ...the \"middleman\" species \u2013 the role played by the civet in the SARS outbreak and camels for MERS \u2013 is still unknown\nThis occurred again in 2012, with the first outbreak of MERS , where a coronavirus which was eventually identified as being passed to humans by dromedary camels . Both MERS and SARS infect the respiratory tract , making them dangerous and very infectious. They spread from respiratory droplets generated during coughing or sneezing and close human contact. Because of this, many of the transmission events occurred at hospitals between patients and healthcare providers that were caring for them.\nEarly on in the current outbreak of 2019-CoV, the initial infection was thought to be zoonotic due to the involvement of Hunan Seafood Market and the limited spread between humans. Many different types of animals were sold at that market, and one group of researchers proposed that the virus it may have come from snakes . However, re-analysis of the data from other biologists contradicts the snake hypothesis and pins 2019-CoV as originating in bats , like SARS and MERS. That early report that the virus arose in snakes came from analysis of the 2019-CoV's genome that suggested the virus adapted genetically to living in snakes, but as David Robertson, bioinformatician at the University of Glasgow reported , that \"it\u2019s clear from phylogenetic analysis, the new human virus is most closely related to bat coronaviruses in the Betacoronaviruses genera.\"\nBut, the \"middleman\" species \u2013 the role played by the civet in the SARS outbreak and camels for MERS \u2013 is still unknown. It is also currently unclear how the virus is spreading between humans, and the CDC recommends taking the precautions you normally would with the flu: washing your hands, avoid touching your face, cover coughs and sneezes, and don't share drinks. More time and research is needed to fully understand 2019-nCoV.\nThe first cases of 2019-nCoV were identified in patrons of a live animal market in China, which has since been shut down.\nThe SARS epidemic has left the world better prepared for a viral outbreak the likes of 2019-nCoV. Health authorities were notified and acted quickly, shutting down the possible source of the virus at the seafood market in Wuhan, China. Wuhan has further tried to contain the virus by ensuring everyone wears masks when in public places, and they recently announced that public transit would be shut down beginning January 23rd 2020. As of the 23rd, the city of Wuhan, and the neighboring cities of Ezho and Huanggang, are locked down , with no one allowed in or out.\nWhile this is a serious issue, it is important to not panic. And, though the World Health Organization decided not to declare a global public health emergency in response to the 2019-CoV outbreak, they have stressed that this does not diminish the seriousness of the disease. To stay updated on the virus, I suggest keeping up with the WHO and CDC updates, or even following some experts in the field on Twitter for immediate updates and nuanced takes: @hayesluk and @MackayIM are two of my favorites.

Earlier samples positive\nBut on Monday, results of the RITM\u2019s retest of her earlier samples showed that she was positive for the virus. Those samples were taken on Jan. 23.\nAs the woman had already recovered and the results of her later tests were negative, she was discharged from the hospital. She left for Shenzhen on Jan. 31.\nThe RITM is currently testing the samples taken before the Philippines had the capability to check for the new coronavirus. Prior to that, the DOH was limited to sending only six samples to Australia for testing.\nDomingo said there was nothing wrong with the tests, only that the patient may have already been toward the end of her illness when samples were taken from her on Jan. 24.\nAsked how the woman got past airport screening when she arrived in the Philippines, Domingo said the woman had no symptoms at the time. ADVERTISEMENT\n\u201cRemember this was Jan. 20. There was no ban on flights, we had very limited information on [the new virus] and it was really tracking patients with fever. This patient had no fever when she passed through [the thermal scanners],\u201d Domingo said.\nChinese authorities locked down Wuhan on Jan. 23, trapping 11 million people. They later expanded the lockdown to other cities in the surrounding Hubei province, restricting the movements of more than 50 million people.\nSimilar to two earlier confirmed cases, Domingo said the DOH had already instructed its regional office in Central Visayas to look for the people who may have interacted with the Chinese woman during her visit to Cebu and Bohol.\nDomingo also called on passengers on the Jan. 20 Cebu Pacific flight 5J 241 \u201cto cooperate with DOH representatives who will be getting in touch with them for assessment.\u201d\nHe said the DOH had already assessed 203 people who had contact with the Chinese couple from Wuhan who were the country\u2019s first two cases of the new coronavirus.\nOf those people, he said, 15 are symptomatic. All except for one have been quarantined for monitoring. Three are health workers.\nFive other people who had contact with the Chinese couple were under quarantine at Negros Oriental Provincial Hospital in Dumaguete City.\nAs of noon on Wednesday, the cumulative number of people observed by the DOH for the new virus had risen to 133. Of that number, 115 were admitted and isolated, while 16 had been discharged but remained under strict monitoring.\nOf those under observation, 63 are Filipinos and 54 are Chinese nationals.\nLocal authorities were observing four people, including a year-old boy, in Quezon and Palawan provinces, for infection with the new virus.\nThe three adults from Quezon, whose nationalities the authorities declined to disclose, traveled to China recently, while the boy in Palawan is part of a Chinese family from Dalian, China, that is vacationing in El Nido.\nIn Baguio City, a Filipino woman who had traveled to Hong Kong is quarantined at a local hospital for monitoring for the new virus. In Tarlac province, a patient who had arrived from Myanmar after a layover in Hong Kong is also under observation for infection. Set for cremation\nMeanwhile, Domingo said the body of the Chinese man whose death on Saturday became the first outside mainland China was set for cremation on Wednesday.\nDuring a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the cremation was delayed because the Chinese group that earlier committed to handle the process had backed out.\nHe was accused of \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d by Senators Francis Pangilinan and Panfilo Lacson after he said that the DOH had traced only 17 percent of the other passengers on three flights to and within the Philippines taken by the Chinese couple because the airlines had invoked privacy.\nThe carriers denied the information, saying they had already submitted the lists of passengers to the DOH and the Bureau of Quarantine.\nSen. Ronald dela Rosa suggested that the DOH seek police help in tracking down the passengers.\nOn Wednesday, the Criminal Detection and Investigation Group of the Philippine National Police began looking for the passengers using flight manifests provided by the airlines. No-show\nDuque did not show up at a hearing on Wednesday called by the House of Representatives, sending word that he was going to Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija province to inspect a drug rehabilitation center there that the government was considering using for the quarantine of Filipinos who would be evacuated from Wuhan.\nMalacanang said it was \u201cvery unfair\u201d to blame the incomplete contact tracing of the other passengrs on Duque, but said the lapses would be rectified.\nCabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said Duque had promised to complete the contact tracing in two days.\n",

        "content": "When the United States 2009 H1N1 swine flu emerged, an international emergency, a declared global pandemic, it eventually infected 60 million and initially killed a minimum of 18,449 cases that year. But the final story of the H1N1 global pandemic was far worse than that, with close to 300,000 deaths, according to the final tallies in 2012 reported by the CDC, as you will read below. Which is why I am scratching my head at how bizarrely negative forces are attacking China and Chinese people as it engages a remarkably aggressive front addressing this Corona virus outbreak which started in Wuhan, central China. I am forced to ask and answer a few questions. During 2009 H1N1 outbreak, I don't recall xenophobic anti-America attacks across the globe, do you? In fact, do you recall it took six months for the U.S. to declare a national emergency? Did any government from the onset in April 2009 through the end in April 2010, including the month of June, when H1N1 was declared an international emergency global pandemic, then send out a notice to its citizens that they should leave the United States? Close their borders to American travelers? Nope, not a peep. Like I said, something's not right, folks. I am reading hateful vicious attacks on the Chinese government for their supposed intentional conspiracy to intentionally under report the number of infections, yet that is exactly and always the case with such flu outbreaks no matter what country and the CDC reports illustrate that crystal clear. The U.S. H1N1 swine flu numbers were vastly underestimated and updated three years later, because dear friends, that is the nature of such viral outbreaks which don't care which country they started in. There is never enough man power, there are never enough test kits, there is never enough medicine or medical supplies. China is not trying to hide these hardships, they are well known, they are being reported on the news daily in China. There are always people who die, thousands of them whom we'll never know if they actually died because of a particular virus. Those are the facts, not any problem unique to China's healthcare system or government. Its not a conspiracy, its just tragedy. According to the June 27, 2012 research report followup three years later, it gets much more disturbing when you learn about the CDC's final estimate of the H1N1 virus global death toll. You and I find at this at this article at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy website, the CDC's 18,449 total deaths number was \"...regarded as WELL BELOW THE TRUE TOTAL, mainly because many people who die of flu-related causes are not tested for the disease.\" So during the 2009 outbreak, was anyone accusing the American medical and government authorities of hiding the numbers? Were Americans with hidden cameras strolling into the Mayo Clinic to PROVE how many people were really dying? The absurdity of these vicious attacks are that whether or not a person specifically does have the Corona virus or some other viral bug presenting as pneumonia, the treatment is the same supportive treatment anyway. Something's not right here folks. The world should be applauding China's unprecedented, broad, aggressive response. (WHO officials and many other government and healthcare officials across the globe are.) I am on the ground here in China READ IT HERE watching with my own eyes and it is quite incredible by any measure, not to mention an enormous economic sacrifice. Instead of looking at the will of an entire system of government acting faster than any other government on the planet could, we are one month later, still busy bashing a few local government officials in Wuhan who should have told us a couple weeks sooner. And yes, that is true those local officials screwed up. And by the way, those officials are in deep trouble for it. Just like the recent Puerto Rican politicians who are in trouble when we learned they didn't distribute hurricane emergency supplies that were sent to them to help during last year's terrible hurricane. A disgrace. Individual people screw up all the time and hopefully justice gets served later, but that's not an indictment of an entire country's government. Secondly, on this point, every provincial government has sent out a notice to its government officials pretty much saying that if they are stupid enough to do the same, they will face the wrath of harsh punishment. I don't doubt it for a moment. Lets contrast to what countless western politicians have gotten away with and remain in office to remind all of us that human error, stupidity and greed is not unique to any particular skin color or race or country. \"What about...\" reactions don't help. And here's the mic drop for you: \"The CDC researchers estimate that the H1N1 2009 pandemic virus caused 201,200 respiratory deaths and another 83,300 deaths from cardiovascular disease associated with H1N1 infections.\" Total: 284,000 deaths. Shocking, isn't it? Was there a travel ban for any length of time to and from the United States? Did China, Germany, Japan or any other country close their border to American travelers? Today I noticed in the updates that following the United States Department of State policy suggesting U.S. citizens leave China, the United Kingdom embassy just released the same recommendation to subjects of the kingdom. In 2009, did UK subjects in America get a notice from their kingdom to leave America? No. Did the world suggest we isolate from America? Close the U.S. borders!? No. Did Americans get xenophobically attacked and targeted by anti-American sentiments like the Chinese are experiencing now? Um, no. Fascinating and disturbing to say the least. If you're an expat currently in China, unless you're in Wuhan, fact is that you're most likely safer and more peaceful and more stable by simply staying put than by leaving right now. You couldn't be safer than in this country, where almost everyone is staying home and dutifully isolating themselves with awareness. Not to mention that the Chinese government's decision to safeguard the society, the families, the people, is coming at a devastating economic cost in the hundreds of billions. I have a friend in Mesa, Arizona. He told me earlier that the big popular China City buffet, a huge busy place, has no customers. Does that make any sense at all? Let's test our ability to reason, to be rational: If you were in Miami and you heard that there was a virus outbreak that started in Milan, in central Italy, would you cancel your dinner reservation at the Italian restaurant that night in South Beach? No. Would you buy a pizza next week at Joey's Pizzeria in Delray Beach? If you were in Singapore and you heard there was a virus outbreak in Dallas, Texas in the central United States, would you stop going to your favorite local Texas southern BBQ restaurant with the owner from Houston, in Singapore? Would you avoid olive-skinned dark-haired Italian-looking people on the street in Chicago? Would you avoid big guys wearing cowboy hats, cuz they're obviously from Texas in Singapore cuz there's a virus in Dallas and they might have just gotten off the plane? There's a strange senseless bullying extremism and activism in today's society and you should do your best to avoid it and not be a part of it. It is fomented by a small group of extremist activists while definitely not supported by your average mainstream person who is simply exhausted by their outrage-inducing antics. Finally, here are some straight up, sensible accurate descriptions of this Corona virus which started in Wuhan, China. Its not called the China virus and neither was H1N1 called the America virus. Whether two weeks or two months from now, this flu season type virus will have passed and the joy of Spring will have arrived. Just like every flu season. However, don't misunderstand me. The extra caution and the remarkable response by the Chinese governments and people together to quell the spread of this virus was warranted because, yes it is correct that this corona virus is nastier than the usual annual flu bug, as was H1N1 in 2009. As of now, what we can confidently note the following regarding this Corona virus: This Corona virus is highly contagious, it spreads quite easily. It binds to lung tissue and so in particular, likes to cause pneumonia, that's what infection of lung tissue is. That's more severe than a respiratory infection which is only in your throat or bronchial tubes. The Corona virus currently has a 2% death rate. That's a lot higher, around 20x higher, than a more typical annual flu virus with a death rate of 0.1%. However, a 2% death rate is still much lower by comparison to the SARS virus which had a 9% death rate or the MERS virus with a really nasty 37% death rate. The Corona virus is causing severe symptoms in 10-15% of cases. 80% to 90% of deaths from this virus are happening in elderly patients, mostly with other existing health problems, not younger people. That characteristic by the way, is in contrast to the America 2009 H1N1 swine flu virus which in fact had a higher death rate amongst younger people including children rather than those over 60 years old. China identified and shared the Corona virus genome in record times, in only days and of course, immediately shared it with all international health and disease organizations. Medical researchers are already discovering that certain existing anti-viral medications seem to be effective against this Corona virus. Its impossible not to marvel at China's broad and aggressive domestic response directed by the provincial level governments to restrict movement, restrict transportation, restrict business for a period of time combined with the voluntary dutiful cooperation of its 1.3 billion citizens who are in the majority quietly staying at home these weeks to let the virus pass; this model response is already being hailed by the international community as a remarkable unprecedented response setting a new standard in understanding what is possible for future outbreaks in whatever country they may occur. Is it inconvenient and costly. You bet. Like I said, something's not right with the way humanity is responding to what's happening here. I haven't put my finger on it because well, its certainly complex and the world is upside down in many other ways that I also can't for the life of me understand or explain without ending up writing a very thick book. But I do know this: It needs to stop. This vicious, political, xenophobic racist attacks and smearing of all things China needs to stop. Its really not helping anyone in the political corridors of Washington nor is it doing anything to help the man on the street who is just concerned with taking care of his family. My family is originally from the Basilicata region of Italy, the little hillside Italian towns of Potenza and also, Grottola, which is just outside of Matera. They left their home country and moved to America where I was born, in Yonkers, New York. America became their home and it was my home until I left, too. Now over two decades ago, I left the United States, the country I was born in, the country that has plenty to admire and plenty to improve. But I left and I came to China and now China is my home. If you had asked me thirty years ago if this was my life plan on planet earth, I would have said you were nuts or a really bad fortune teller. But that's how it has turned out. I am truly blessed with my lovely Chinese wife and our family living here in Shenyang in China's northeast. You get my meaning? I am a mature adult like many with the powers of observation. I can easily see that whether we are talking about China or the United States or any other country, their societies and their governments have good points and bad points. The xenophobia needs to stop now. Whether in a couple of weeks or months later, this nasty flu type Corona virus will begin declining and the joy of Spring will arrive. Between now and then if you don't have anything good, anything supportive to say about China or Chinese people, how about you just keep your mouth shut. Mario Cavolo, Shenyang.",

        "content": "NEW YORK (PRWEB)April 23, 2020 A team of researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in collaboration with GenScript, is developing a synthetic antibody to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This antibody is intended to block the virus from entering human lung cells, and would be another potential treatment option for COVID-19.\nThe efforts are being led by Mone Zaidi, MD, PhD, MACP, Director of the Mount Sinai Bone Program and Professor of Medicine (Endocrinology, Diabetes and Bone Disease) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Tony Yuen, PhD, Associate Director for Research for the Mount Sinai Bone Program and Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.\nCoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have many protein \"spikes\" protruding from their outer surface. A specific region of the \"spike\" called the S1 protein binds to a molecule called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or ACE2, which is found on the surface of many human cells, including those in the lungs. This is the entry point by which the virus infects a person.\nIn hopes of developing a treatment that could block the viral entry into cells, Dr. Zaidi and his team, including Sakshi Gera, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, are creating an antibody targeted to a peptide sequence of the S1 spike protein that should interfere with, and thereby block, the virus and prevent its initial attachment and entry into human cells.\nThe artificial blocking antibody then could be given to people with COVID-19 to stop the virus from infecting additional cells, much as doctors are already doing with natural antibodies harvested from people who have survived COVID-19, in what is known as convalescent plasma therapy.\n\"Given that convalescent plasma is showing promise and potential in treating this novel virus, the same strategy should be adopted for treatment in sick patients by creating a targeted antibody, which we hope will have the ability to disengage and block COVID-19 from entering our cells. Having experience with antibody development, my lab has embarked on this task together with the generous support of GenScript,\" said Dr. Zaidi.\nThe first step, now underway, is to create a custom version of the S1 spike's peptide sequence, which will be used to generate the antibody. Once the peptide sequence is available, Dr. Zaidi's team will collaborate with GenScript to generate a human antibody which will be tested for efficacy in human cells in culture and animal models. Dr. Zaidi and his team hope to then collaborate with Mount Sinai's Department of Microbiology for further antibody testing. \"It's hard to project how long it will take to have something we can test in patients, but my aim is to have a targeted antibody for first human trials within the next 12 months if all goes as planned, but it could be earlier,\" said Dr. Zaidi.\n\"GenScript's collaboration with Dr. Zaidi's lab to co-develop a COVID-19 antibody program signifies GenScript's ongoing commitment to work with scientific communities to annihilate and prevent COVID-19 beyond its business model. We expect that GenScript's antibody discovery and development expertise, especially in the field of COVID-19, will fuel Mount Sinai's first-rate research and development capabilities to bring this important medication to patients,\" said Kenneth Lee, Head of US Commercial Division at GenScript ProBio.\nFor more information about Mount Sinai's COVID-19 research and response effort, visit https://www.mountsinai.org/covid19 .\nAbout GenScript\nGenScript is the world leader in biotechnology reagent services and biologics. Established in 2002 in New Jersey, United States, the company was the first to commercialize gene synthesis and successfully establish fully integrated capabilities for custom peptide synthesis, protein expression and engineering, custom antibody development and engineering, in vitro/in vivo pharmacology as well as a variety of catalogue products.

        "content": "This day - 25th January - is special for the Chinese, for it happens to be their Lunar New Year and is also known as Spring Festival, a grandest festival in China, with a 7-day long holiday. The Chinese Spring Festival or the Lunar New Year is the most colorful annual event, celebrated across the country with traditional new year celebrations, which lasts up to two weeks and this year it is scheduled to last until 8th February. The Chinese New Year is internationally known for its iconic red lanterns, loud fireworks, massive banquets and parades, and the festival even triggers exuberant celebrations across the globe and therefore it is no wonder that many international tourists visit China during this celebratory period. Most unfortunately, this years Chinese New Year celebration has been muted by the novel Corona Virus, which has struck the city of Wuhan in central China, the spread of this virus has been declared as a health emergency in China by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The past few days, most news headlines across the world, including India, have front paged the news of the novel Corona Virus (nCoV), which has wreaked havoc in the city of Wuhan, China, bringing it to a eerie silence. The fear of the virus and its spread is so severe that the Chinese Government has restricted the movement of nearly 40 million people and an unprecedented and indefinite lockdown has been imposed in 13 cities in central China, aimed at arresting the spread of this virus. The resultant travel lockdown, just ahead China\u2019s Lunar New Year holiday, the busiest travel season, has effected not just China but the whole of the global community, including India. The severity of the fear of the spread of the nCoV has drawn the attention of the World Health Organisation, who has declared it a health emergency in China and just stopping from calling it a global epidemic. Although there was no unanimity among the WHO, while debating on the issue for declaring it as a global outbreak, yet there was one certainty, the seriousness of the issue. The total deaths reported by the Chinese health authorities has already touched 41 with at least 15 new deaths reported in Wuhan, the epicentre of this deadly virus, just yesterday. The virus is now no longer confined just to China. It has spread to other countries as well with a second case confirmed in the United States and three cases confirmed in France. Health officials across the globe are preparing for an outbreak that could last months. The novel Corona Virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in a market selling live poultry, seafood and wild animals. Now the virus has spread to South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam and the United States. Investigators in other countries, including Mexico and Saudi Arabia, are evaluating possible cases. As soon as the news of nCoV spread broke out, the Indian Government too has initiated measures to contain its spread in our country. Passengers flying into India from affected areas in China and other countries are being examined and as many as 20,844 passengers, from 96 flights, have been screened for nCoV symptoms in India, as of January 24, as per the statement issued from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Just yesterday, the health ministry said , 4,082 passengers were screened in 19 flights and a travel advisory has been extended to 12 more airports in addition to the current seven. Fortunately for us, the Health Ministry statement said that no case of novel coronavirus (nCoV) has been detected in the country so far. The health Ministry has also identified different labs across India which can screen for the nCoV and the National Institute of Virology, an ICMR lab, has confirmed that none of the samples screened so far from passengers who have flown into India from affected areas have shown positive and therefore it is sign for some relief as of now. However a news has now confirmed that the first known Indian national, Preeti Maheshwari, who is afflicted with the Corona virus is battling for life in a hospital in China. Maheshwari, a primary art school teacher at the International School of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, who suffered a coronavirus pneumonia attack leading to respiratory failure is now suspected of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and has gone into a septic shock and is undergoing treatment in the intensive care unit at Shekou Hospital in Shenzhen, China. Therefore, in the connected world we now live in, it is absolutely essential that the government and all health workers must remain on high alert to combat the spread of this menace. Virus, such as the Corona viruses, are highly contagious and spread rapidly. The Corona virus is named so due to the spikes that protrude from their membranes, which resemble the sun\u2019s corona. The current virus China dubbed the novel Corona virus nCoV, can infect both animals and people, and can cause illnesses of the respiratory tract, ranging from the common cold to severe conditions like the SARS - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - which had earlier affected thousands of people around the world and killed nearly a thousand people during its 2003 outbreak. The Chinese researchers earlier had announced that the mysterious illness that had sickened 59 people in the city of Wuhan, with 11 million population, in central China was because of the novel Corona Virus nCoV. These cases were linked to workers at a market that sold live fish, animals and birds. This market was later shut down and disinfected by the Chinese authorities. It is therefore certain that animals are the most likely primary source of the outbreak of nCoV, but unfortunately which animals are responsible for this virus is not certain. Our experience has shown that the past virus outbreaks of similar illnesses, including SARS, also are believed to have emerged from live animal markets. It is also now fairly well known that one form of coronavirus causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, which is transmitted to humans by camels. The current nCoV, the Chinese health officials believe, can also be transmitted from person to person and a growing number of people, including medical staff caring for patients, have become infected in Wuhan, and it has therefore made containment of the spread of this virus more difficult. Scientists researching on the nCoV are still not sure how exactly the virus spreads. However it is certain that the nCoV it can be transmitted from one person to another, which makes it a bigger risk than if it were carried only from animals to humans. The virus most likely gets transmitted through coughing and sneezing, as is the case with influenza and other respiratory viruses, which are highly infectious. The best selling book \u201cThe World is Flat : A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century.\" by Thomas Friedman, New York Times, columnist, uses a metaphor -World is Flat- to describe the 21st century\u2019s connected world (inspired by Nandan Nilekani), which offers a level playing field for commerce to the global community, destined to economically benefit countries like India. But then this very advantageous level playing field -of a connected world- comes with spread of viruses such as the current nCoV, and its consequences. We must therefore be prepared to face such consequences by reminding ourselves of the 1918 pandemic Spanish Flu, which had killed more than 75 million people across the globe including in India. The year 2018, marked the centenary of the 1918 pandemic -the Spanish Flu Outbreak-which rampaged the world and killed 75/to 100 million people an estimated 5 percent of the world\u2019s population. India too has paid a heavy price during this outbreak, resulting in an estimated 17 million deaths, in two waves of this deadly flu that swept India in May and October of that year (1918). A hundred years later, scientists know much more about how to prevent and treat such diseases. But the threat of a global outbreak, like the current nCoV is now far greater than ever. Understanding what happened during this major health crisis is therefore important, particularly in the current connected world and an era of humanity\u2019s growing population and its ever continuing drift to crowded cities across the globe and the resulting cohabitation of limited space with animal kingdom, which aid in spreading of diseases. All it takes now is one plane ride for a few localized cases of a disease to become an epidemic. In order to create an understanding of the importance of such epidemics and their impact among the public, in the year 2018, the Nehru Science Centre, (NCSM), Ministry of Culture, Government of India, had organised an exhibition \u201cOutbreak : An Epidemic in a Connected World\u201d, which was developed by the National Museum of Natural History, a Smithsonian Institution, to commemorate the centenary of the Spanish Flu. This exhibition was brought to our centre with support from the Harvard Global Health Institute. TB, Malaria, Dengue, Influenza, and such other diseases like AIDS, Ebola, Cholera, Plague, Nipah, Zika etc. terrorise our country and kill thousands every year. If this is not scary the modern lifestyles in a connected world and ever increasing migration from villages and smaller towns to larger metropolitans and to global cities, with ever shrinking space, and inadequate hygiene is sure shot recipe for disaster and the best way to arrest this is creating awareness on infectious diseases and outbreaks. Therefore the Nehru Science Centres in its continuing efforts to create public awareness on these issues organises exhibitions on such topics from time to time and even the current on going exhibition \u2018Superbugs : Is it the end of Antibiotics?, about which I have already posted earlier is also aimed at creating public awareness on health issues. I do hope that the earlier exhibition\u2019Outbreak, and the current exhibition Superbugs, help in sowing a seed of public awareness with a hope that it will result in changing behaviour on an individual and community level to bring about the much needed difference. This awareness, we hope, will go a long way in lowering the pandemic risk of spread of infectious diseases like the nCoV which the world is now facing.

WHO Director-General Dr Matshidiso Moeti in a statement CRN saw, declared the novel corona virus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. He sent out a guidance note to all countries on how to prepare for a possible novel corona virus outbreak. \u201cIt is critical that countries step up their readiness and in particular put in place effective screening mechanisms at airports and other major points of entry to ensure that the first cases are detected quickly,\u201d said Dr Moeti. He added that \u201cthe quicker countries can detect cases, the faster they will be able to contain an outbreak and ensure the novel corona virus does not overwhelm health systems\u201d. Rapid confirmation or ruling out novel corona virus cases, establishing a platform for isolating suspected or confirmed cases, passing good information to the public and pre-positioning supplies are all important actions for countries to undertake. WHO has identified top priority countries, including Algeria, Angola, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, the DR Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan and Zambia. Active screening at airports has been established in a majority of these countries and while they will be WHO first areas of focus.

Certified medical assistant Wendy Kerley gives Ethan Getman, 15, a shot of the flu vaccine in Memphis. (Jim Weber/Daily Memphian/AP) By Lenny Bernstein February 1, 2020 at 8:00 AM EST The rapidly spreading virus has closed schools in Knoxville, Tenn., cut blood donations to dangerous levels in Cleveland and prompted limits on hospital visitors in Wilson, N.C. More ominously, it has infected as many as 26 million people in the United States in just four months, killing up to 25,000 so far. In other words, a difficult but not extraordinary flu season in the United States, the kind most people shrug off each winter or handle with rest, fluids and pain relievers if they contract the illness. But this year, a new coronavirus from China has focused attention on diseases that can sweep through an entire population, rattling the public despite the current magnitude of the threat. Clearly, the flu poses the bigger and more pressing peril; a handful of cases of the new respiratory illness have been reported in the United States, none of them fatal or apparently even life-threatening. \u201cAnything that we don\u2019t feel we have sufficient information about feels like a threat,\u201d said Lynn Bufka, senior director of practice research and policy at the American Psychological Association and an expert on anxiety. \u201cThe flu doesn\u2019t feel novel. Most people\u2019s experience with the flu is they\u2019ve had it, they\u2019ve recovered, it\u2019s not a big deal \u2014 despite the fact that thousands of people die every year.\u201d ( and /The Washington Post) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 8.6 million to 12 million people have visited health-care providers complaining of influenza-like symptoms, such as fever, coughing, sneezing and aches since the flu season began Oct. 1. As many as 310,000 have been hospitalized, and 68 children have died. On the CDC\u2019s map of flu activity, most of the nation is a deep red, indicating the highest level of \u201cinfluenza-like illness\u201d activity. The entire school district serving Knoxville and Knox County, Tenn., which has 57,800 students, shut down this past week because of flu circulating among students and staff. In Cuyahoga County, Ohio, which includes Cleveland, 218 people have died and 2,500 have shown up in emergency rooms in the city alone, said Merle Gordon, director of the city\u2019s Department of Public Health. In Arkansas, nine school districts are closed, 33 people have died and hospitalizations have increased sharply in the past two weeks. \u201cWe\u2019re being hit right now, a lot of communities at the same time,\u201d said Jennifer Dillaha, medical director for immunizations and outbreak response for the Arkansas Department of Health. More than 173 million doses of flu vaccine have been administered to date, much less than needed to cover the nation. During the 2018-2019 flu season, the latest with complete data available, just 45.3 percent of adults and 62.6 percent of children received flu shots, according to the CDC. Two types of flu are circulating , increasing risk. They seem to be producing fewer fatalities among older people, who typically comprise most of the deaths during flu season, but they are hitting children hard. The current season does not appear to be as severe as 2017-2018, when the flu reached epidemic proportions and as many as 95,000 people died, according to CDC estimates. But no amount of flu can mitigate public fear and interest in the new coronavirus, which is spreading inexorably out of China, where it has killed more than 200 people and infected more than 11,000. \u201cI would say that there\u2019s good interest in both,\u201d Dillaha said. \u201cI think people are a little bit panicked about coronavirus and want to know what steps to take, thinking that it\u2019s circulating in the state.\u201d So far, it isn\u2019t, she said. \u201cAny time someone asks about the flu, they talk about coronavirus, and any time they talk coronavirus, they ask about the flu,\u201d she said. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the government task force coordinating the response to the coronavirus, said he is often asked why the government is focusing on coronavirus when so many are dying of seasonal influenza. \u201cI often get asked: \u2018We have an influenza outbreak here, we have about 8,000 deaths already, 100,000 hospitalizations. Why are we paying such attention\u2019\u2009\u201d to coronavirus? \u201cThe reason is, despite the morbidity and mortality with influenza, there\u2019s a certainty of seasonal flu. I can tell you as we get into March and April, the cases are going to go down.\u201d Until officials can offer that kind of certainty about the coronavirus, even if it does not seem as dangerous as the flu, anxiety levels will not decline, Bufka said. While public health officials are urging handwashing, staying home when sick and keeping a distance from obviously ill people, Bufka suggests a different calculation for mental health. When she counsels anxious clients, they \u201ctry to get a good assessment of what is actually the risk,\u201d she said. \u201cHow likely is it? And try to distinguish between possibility and probability. \u201cSure, it\u2019s possible there will be more cases in the U.S. It\u2019s probable there will be more cases in the U.S. But it\u2019s not likely to be the person standing next to me in the grocery store.\u201d U.S. to deny entry to foreign nationals who recently visited China Unprecedented Chinese quarantine could backfire, experts say U.S. reports first person-to-person transmission of coronavirus",

It clarified that those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat the symptoms. Those with severe illness should be given optimized supportive care. \u201cSome specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials,\u201d it said.\n\u2022 Does nCoV ARD affect older people, or are younger people are also susceptible?\n\u201cPeople of all ages can be infected by the nCoV ARD,\u201d WHO said. Older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advised the public to protect themselves by observing good hand and respiratory hygiene.\n\u2022 Can pets at home spread the nCoV ARD?\n\u201cAt present, there is no evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the nCoV ARD,\u201d WHO said. They advised pet owners to always wash hands with soap and water after contact with pets. This will protect pet owners against various common bacteria such as E. coli and salmonella that can pass between pets and humans.\nAccording to the Department of Health, the first confirmed case of nCoV ARD in the Philippines is a 38-year-old woman from Wuhan, China.\nWHO on Friday (PH time) declared the outbreak a global emergency, as cases have spread to at least 18 countries. The disease has claimed 213 lives as of this writing.",

One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning?\" Trump said during his daily briefing at the White House. \"Because, you see, it gets on the lungs, and it does a tremendous number on the lungs.

Small amounts are deadly,\" Gupta said.\nOnline, others doctors reacted with horror.\nGupta added that it was \"demoralizing\" for a doctor to hear the White House \"peddle improper health messaging\" and said the president had a pattern of pushing unproven medical treatments.\nThe president spent weeks advocating to use the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine after anecdotal evidence suggested that it might help patients fight COVID-19, the disease associated with the coronavirus. On Tuesday, a study of coronavirus patients in a Veterans Affairs hospital reported more deaths among those treated with hydroxychloroquine than among those treated with standard care.\n\"It's exceptionally dangerous,\" Gupta said. \"There's people who hang on to every word of the president.\"\nThe claim came after a long exchange in which Trump also suggested that light and heat - which also can destroy the coronavirus on a surface - be used to cure the disease.\n\"Maybe you can. Maybe you can't. I'm not a doctor. I'm, like, a person who has a good you-know-what,\" Trump said, pointing to his head.\nDr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said she had not seen heat and light used as \"a treatment.\"\nJoe Biden, the apparent Democratic presidential nominee, criticized Trump for the suggestions on Twitter.\n\"Here's an idea, Mr. President: more tests. Now. And protective equipment for actual medical professionals,\" he said.",

The remaining Indians in the city mostly comprise students and around 50 working individuals, these people added.\nIndia has requested the Chinese foreign ministry as well as local officials in Wuhan to consider making arrangements for Indians to leave, news agency PTI quoted sources as saying. It is not clear how and when India plans to evacuate its citizens if approval is granted.\nThe United States was reported to have begun arranging for a charter flight, a Boeing 767 jet that can carry around 230 passengers, to bring its citizens and diplomats back from Wuhan on Sunday, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Washington was given approval for the operation from the Chinese foreign ministry, the report added.\nRussia too was consulting with China while France was setting up a bus service to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan, according to media reports quoting the Russian embassy and the French consulate.\nIn India, a top adviser of the Prime Minister met senior bureaucrats from across several ministries to review response mechanisms if the contagion spreads to India, while authorities also issued a fresh travel advisory urging people to avoid going to China unless essential.\nThere are at least 11 people who have been isolated with symptoms similar to an nCoV infection \u2013 with dozens more being monitored over phone after they travelled to Chinese cities.\nThe virus also expanded its footprint as Australia confirmed its first four cases on Saturday. Late on Friday, Malaysia confirmed three and France reported Europe\u2019s first infection.\nHong Kong also declared an emergency, scrapping celebrations and restricting links to mainland China. Apart from these, positive cases of coronavirus have been reported from South Korea, Thailand, Nepal, Macau, Hong Kong, Singapore and as far as the US.\nAuthorities in Wuhan said they will build a second hospital dedicated to coronavirus patients, a day after construction began for a 1,000-bed facility scheduled to be completed within ten days. About 450 military medics have also been deployed to help treat patients in the central city.\nRegions far from the epidemic epicentre, such as Beijing, have also started to clamp down on the flow of people. On Saturday, the country\u2019s capital said it would suspend buses in and out of the city, on top of closing tourist attractions and cancelling large-scale events during the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\u201cAs long as we have steadfast confidence, work together, scientific prevention and cures, and precise policies, we will definitely be able to win the battle,\u201d Chinese President Xi told a meeting of the elite Politburo Standing Committee on Saturday.\nThe virus has caused global alarm because of its similarity to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).The newly identified strain still has many unknowns surrounding it, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases, and shows flu-like symptoms.\nParticularly at risk are people who are either very young or old and those with a compromised immunity due to other diseases.\n",

We will carry out these tests in China with the appropriate organizations and safety profiles. Oral recombinant methioninase should be effective therapy for 2019-nCoV disease since coronaviruses have a special requirement for methionine,\u201d said Dr. Han.\nAntiCancer will collaborate with its sister company in Beijing, AntiCancer Beijing, to develop oral recombinant methioninase for 2019-nCoV in China.

        "content": "Homeopathy Treatment of Corona Virus Last Updated On: February 3, 2020\nWith the advent of the third case of coronavirus reported in India, its a cause of grave concern for us and hence today we are going to shed further light on to how to combat this outbreak.\nAll the cases were reported in Kerala itself, where the first patient was a former student from Wuhan University in China ( the city where the virus originated).\nFollowed this, Indian Government is preparing to evacuate its citizens from China\u2019s Wuhan city via airlift. The USA has also given protocol to its citizens not to travel to China, till further notice. Similarly Indian citizens are also urged to refrain from travelling there.\nThe Ministry of AYUSH on Wednesday issued an advisory for the \u201cprevention\u201d of infection from this novel strain of coronavirus using homoeopathy. The Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy(CCRH), in the 64th meeting of its Scientific advisory board on 28thJanuary,2020, discussed the ways and means of prevention of Coronavirus infection through Homoeopathy. It also gives some dietary recommendations of easily digestible, light and soft diets, apart from personal hygiene tips to prevent this air-borne infection.\nBefore this new strain came into being, there were six other coronavirus strains \u2014 including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). This newly discovered strain is designated as 2019-nCoV and commonly called the \u2018novel strain\u2019. Among humans, three other strains of coronavirus continuously circulate and cause pneumonia, bronchitis, respiratory tract infections, and even the common cold.\nIt is believed to have originated last year in a food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife meat. Health experts suspect it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another animal species. Coronaviruses thrive more in the winter and are airborne. The typical incubation period for a cold-causing coronavirus strain is three days, however, for the novel strain, this period is anywhere between two to 10 days.\nTill now it has killed 362 people and infected more than 17000. Fewer than 100 cases have been recorded outside China by spreading to 23 other countries, including India\u2019s neighbours Nepal and Sri Lanka, and Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, South Korea, Japan, France, Germany, Canada, and US etc. The first death outside of Chinawas recorded in Philippines today. The Cabinet Secretary of GOI has reviewed the preventive measures on the coronavirus outbreak with secretaries in the ministries of health, external affairs, civil aviation etc. Approximately 35,000 people have undergone thermal screening in the country and a list has been served to the health ministries of various states of the people who recently travelled to China.\nAccording to the AYUSH ministry advisory, following are some tips for prevention: Maintain personal hygiene. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Avoid spitting in public. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your face during cough or sneeze and wash your hands after coughing or sneezing. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. Preferably, use an N95 mask while travelling or working in public places to avoid droplet transmission If you suspect Corona Viral infection, wear a mask and contact your nearest hospital immediately.\nAlarming signs of infection include fever, generalised weakness ( fatigue), cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.In more severe cases, it can lead to leukopenia, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.\nHomeopathic medicine can serve beautifully as preventive medicine against the infection.\nIt should also be taken into account that homoeopathy works based on the symptoms present in patients. Also according to the geographical conditions and climate the symptoms of a coronavirus patient may slightly differ in India compared to that of China.\nHomeopathic therapeutics are based on symptom similarity and so there are over 100plus medicines that , if selected carefully , have the capability to treat viral diseases. Some homeopathic remedies have the ability to prevent viruses from attacking.\nSince virus attacks on our immune system making it weaker day by day, homoeopathy works to improve it along with acting as a preventive to control and stop the spread of the Epidemic. Prescriptions in such cases can be chosen by your physician either as a constitutional prescription or in the form of a similar nosode, further profiling the concept of Genus epidemicus ( a specific remedy chosen for an epidemic on a common symptom picture).\nFollowing are some of the safest choice to take, Phosphorus,",

Cryptosporidium and Giardia in Ruminants Cryptosporidium and Giardia are ubiquitous protozoan parasites that infect a broad range of vertebrate hosts, including domestic and wild animals as well as humans. Both parasites are of medical and veterinary importance. Infections with Cryptosporidium and Giardia in ruminants are associated with diarrhea outbreaks, mainly in young animals. Ruminants are potential sources of infection for humans because some species of Cryptosporidium and assemblages of Giardia duodenalis have been isolated from both ruminants and humans. Knowledge of these parasites has greatly expanded in the last 2 decades from simple microscopic obser...

        "content": "GSK to make adjuvant technology available to support rapid development of candidate vaccines Oslo, Norway; London, UK\nCEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and GSK today announced a new collaboration aimed at helping the global effort to develop a vaccine for the 2019-nCoV virus. In this new move GSK will make its established pandemic vaccine adjuvant platform technology available to enhance the development of an effective vaccine against 2019-nCoV.\nGSK is a leader in the development of innovative vaccines using different adjuvant systems. An adjuvant is added to some vaccines to enhance the immune response, thereby creating a stronger and longer lasting immunity against infections than the vaccine alone. The use of an adjuvant is of particular importance in a pandemic situation since it can reduce the amount of antigen required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and made available to more people.\nDr Richard Hatchett, CEO, CEPI commented: \u201cGaining access to GSK\u2019s world-leading adjuvant technology is a huge step forward in developing a vaccine against the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. Coupling GSK\u2019s adjuvant systems with the pioneering platform technology we are funding has the potential to make more vaccine available more rapidly \u2013 by decreasing the dose of vaccine antigen required to protect each individual. This \u201cantigen-sparing\u201d effect makes a given supply of vaccine go farther, increasing the number of people who can benefit.\u201d\nThomas Breuer, Chief Medical Officer, GSK Vaccines, commented: \u201cAs a leader in science and innovation, we believe we can help to contribute to the fight against 2019-nCOV with one of our advanced vaccine adjuvant systems. Our adjuvant technology has previously been used successfully in the pandemic flu setting. It enables using only small quantities of the vaccine antigen which allows the production of more doses of the vaccine \u2013 a crucial advantage in a pandemic.\u201d\nCEPI will coordinate engagements between GSK and entities funded by CEPI who are interested in testing their vaccine platform with GSK\u2019s adjuvant technology to develop effective vaccines against 2019-nCoV. The first agreement to formalize this arrangement has been signed between GSK and the University of Queensland, Australia, which entered a partnering agreement with CEPI in January 2019 to develop a \u201cmolecular clamp\u201d vaccine platform, intended to enable targeted and rapid vaccine production against multiple viral pathogens. CEPI has extended this funding to work on a 2019-nCoV virus vaccine candidate, and access to the GSK adjuvant technology will now support this early stage research.\nRoger Connor, President, GSK Vaccines, added: \u201cAt GSK we believe in the value CEPI can bring to responding to outbreaks like 2019-nCOV. We are proud to contribute to cutting edge research from scientists at the University of Queensland, and we are open to working with other partners, who have a promising vaccine platform that could be used together with our adjuvant.\u201d\nProf Peter H\u00f8j, Vice-Chancellor, The University of Queensland, added: \u201cThe research team at The University of Queensland are progressing a 2019-nCoV vaccine program and the availability of the GSK adjuvant will enable us to carry out important pre-clinical experiments designed to assess vaccine effectiveness.\u201d\nThis announcement complements 4 prior CEPI programmes of work relating to 2019-nCoV vaccine development already announced by CEPI, in partnership with: CureVac; Inovio; The University of Queensland; and Moderna, Inc. and the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. These partnerships seek to improve the scientific understanding of the novel coronavirus, and to develop vaccines against it. These programmes will leverage rapid response platforms already supported by CEPI with the aim of advancing 2019-nCoV vaccine candidates into clinical testing as quickly as possible. In addition, CEPI launched a new call for proposals to rapidly develop and manufacture already proven vaccine technology that can be used against the new coronavirus. The call is rolling and open until February.\nBoth CEPI and GSK are committed to principles of equitable access and will work together in this collaboration to ensure that this principle governs the development, use and access of any 2019-nCoV vaccine developed through the collaboration.\nAbout the novel coronavirus Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can lead to respiratory illness, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). Coronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people and can evolve into strains not previously identified in humans. On January 7, 2020, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the cause of pneumonia cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China, and additional cases have since then been found in a number of countries, which so far could all be traced back to Wuhan City, China.\nAbout CEPI CEPI is an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organisations, launched at Davos in 2017, to develop vaccines to stop future epidemics. CEPI has reached over US$750 million of its $1 billion funding target. CEPI\u2019s priority diseases include Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, Nipah virus, Rift Valley Fever and Chikungunya virus. CEPI also invests in platform technologies that can be used for rapid vaccine and immunoprophylactic development against unknown pathogens (eg 2019-nCoV). To date, CEPI has committed to investing over $456 million in vaccine and platform development. Learn more at www.cepi.net. Follow us at @CEPIvaccines",

George Calvelo, ABS-CBN News MANILA \u2014 A lawmaker said Wednesday that Health Secretary Francisco Duque III should \"fix\" his priorities, after the latter skipped a House inquiry into the government's response to a coronavirus outbreak from China.\nDuque told DZMM he was instead set to inspect a mega drug rehab facility in Fort Magsaysay that would be used to quarantine around 42 Filipinos repatriated from China's Hubei province, where the new strain of virus was first detected.\n\u201cAs the overall in-charge in handling this crisis, he should've been here \u2014 hindi 'yung taga-inspect na lang ng kwarto (not being a mere room inspector),\" Muntinlupa Rep.

Duque, he should fix his priorities),\" he added.\nThe lawmaker also questioned why there were still flights to China's Wuhan City, believed to the virus' epicenter, until Jan. 22.\nThe imposition of travel restrictions is an international decision that involves various repercussions on labor and trade, Health Undersecretary and Spokesperson Eric Domingo earlier said.\nThe Philippines earlier this week banned travel to and from mainland China and its special administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau as health experts seek to contain the fast-spreading new strain of the coronavirus.\nBefore this, the quarantine bureau started screening airports and the epidemiology bureau went on alert, said Dr. Ruby Constantino of the health department's disease prevention and control bureau.\nBiazon said crisis managers should \"shape up\" to allay public fears. Manila 1st District Rep. Manny Lopez, who chairs the Metro Manila development committee, said Duque had \"to work doubly hard.\"\nDuque's office did not immediately respond to ABS-CBN News' request for comment.\nDuque last week attended a plenary session where only 5 lawmakers asked questions about government response to the virus that as of Wednesday has killed nearly 500 and infected more than 24,000.",

The newly discovered virus can cause coughing, fever, breathing difficulty and pneumonia.\nAirports in the U.S. and other countries have stepped up monitoring, checking passengers from China for signs of illness. The U.S. is the fifth country to report seeing the illness, following China, Thailand, Japan, and South Korea.\nLate last week, U.S. health officials began screening passengers from Wuhan in central China, where the outbreak began, at three U.S. airports \u2014 New York City\u2019s Kennedy airport and the Los Angeles and San Francisco airports. On Tuesday, the CDC announced it will add Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare airport and Atlanta\u2019s airport to the mix later this week.\nWhat\u2019s more, officials will begin forcing all passengers that originate in Wuhan to go to one of those five airports if they wish to enter the U.S.\nOfficials around the world have implemented similar airport screenings in hopes of containing the virus during the busy Lunar New Year travel season.\nThe U.S. resident had no symptoms when he arrived at the Seattle-Tacoma airport last Wednesday, but he contacted doctors on Sunday when he started feeling ill, officials said.\nLast month, doctors began seeing the new virus in people who got sick after spending time at a food market in Wuhan. More than 275 cases of the newly identified coronavirus have been confirmed in China, most of them in Wuhan, according to the World Health Organization.\nThe count includes six deaths \u2014 all in China, most of them age 60 or older, including at least some who had a previous medical condition.\nOfficials have said it probably spread from animals to people, but this week Chinese officials said they\u2019ve concluded it also can spread from person to person.\nHealth authorities this month identified the germ behind the outbreak as a new type of coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold; others found in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses.\nSARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, belongs to the coronavirus family, but Chinese state media say the illness in Wuhan is different from coronaviruses that have been identified in the past. Earlier laboratory tests ruled out SARS and MERS \u2014 Middle East respiratory syndrome \u2014 as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common lung-infecting germs.\nThe new virus so far does not appear to be as deadly as SARS and MERS, but viruses can sometimes mutate to become more dangerous.\nUniversity of Washington coronavirus researcher David Veesler said the public \u201cshould not be panicking right now.\u201d\nThe response has been \u201cvery efficient,\u201d Veesler said. \u201cIn a couple of weeks, China was able to identify the virus, isolate it, sequence it and share that information.\u201d\nVeesler added: \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough data to judge how severe the disease is.\u201d\nThe CDC\u2019s Dr. Nancy Messonnier said health officials expected to see more cases in the U.S. and around the world in the coming days.",

        "content": "Something's not right here folks. The world should be applauding China's unprecedented, broad, aggressive response. (WHO officials and many other government and healthcare officials across the globe are.) I am on the ground here in China READ IT HERE watching with my own eyes and it is quite incredible by any measure, not to mention an enormous economic sacrifice. Instead of looking at the will of an entire system of government acting faster than any other government on the planet could, we are one month later, still busy bashing a few local government officials in Wuhan who should have told us a couple weeks sooner. And yes, that is true those local officials screwed up. And by the way, those officials are in deep trouble for it. Just like the recent Puerto Rican politicians who are in trouble when we learned they didn't distribute hurricane emergency supplies that were sent to them to help during last year's terrible hurricane. A disgrace. Individual people screw up all the time and hopefully justice gets served later, but that's not an indictment of an entire country's government. Secondly, on this point, every provincial government has sent out a notice to its government officials pretty much saying that if they are stupid enough to do the same, they will face the wrath of harsh punishment. I don't doubt it for a moment. Lets contrast to what countless western politicians have gotten away with and remain in office to remind all of us that human error, stupidity and greed is not unique to any particular skin color or race or country. \"What about...\" reactions don't help. And here's the mic drop for you: \"The CDC researchers estimate that the H1N1 2009 pandemic virus caused 201,200 respiratory deaths and another 83,300 deaths from cardiovascular disease associated with H1N1 infections.\" Total: 284,000 deaths. Shocking, isn't it? Was there a travel ban for any length of time to and from the United States? Did China, Germany, Japan or any other country close their border to American travelers? Today I noticed in the updates that following the United States Department of State policy suggesting U.S. citizens leave China, the United Kingdom embassy just released the same recommendation to subjects of the kingdom. In 2009, did UK subjects in America get a notice from their kingdom to leave America? No. Did the world suggest we isolate from America? Close the U.S. borders!? No. Did Americans get xenophobically attacked and targeted by anti-American sentiments like the Chinese are experiencing now? Um, no. Fascinating and disturbing to say the least. If you're an expat currently in China, unless you're in Wuhan, fact is that you're most likely safer and more peaceful and more stable by simply staying put than by leaving right now. You couldn't be safer than in this country, where almost everyone is staying home and dutifully isolating themselves with awareness. Not to mention that the Chinese government's decision to safeguard the society, the families, the people, is coming at a devastating economic cost in the hundreds of billions. I have a friend in Mesa, Arizona. He told me earlier that the big popular China City buffet, a huge busy place, has no customers. Does that make any sense at all? Let's test our ability to reason, to be rational: If you were in Miami and you heard that there was a virus outbreak that started in Milan, in central Italy, would you cancel your dinner reservation at the Italian restaurant that night in South Beach? No. Would you buy a pizza next week at Joey's Pizzeria in Delray Beach? If you were in Singapore and you heard there was a virus outbreak in Dallas, Texas in the central United States, would you stop going to your favorite local Texas southern BBQ restaurant with the owner from Houston, in Singapore? Would you avoid olive-skinned dark-haired Italian-looking people on the street in Chicago? Would you avoid big guys wearing cowboy hats, cuz they're obviously from Texas in Singapore cuz there's a virus in Dallas and they might have just gotten off the plane? There's a strange senseless bullying extremism and activism in today's society and you should do your best to avoid it and not be a part of it. It is fomented by a small group of extremist activists while definitely not supported by your average mainstream person who is simply exhausted by their outrage-inducing antics. Finally, here are some straight up, sensible accurate descriptions of this Corona virus which started in Wuhan, China. Its not called the China virus and neither was H1N1 called the America virus. Whether two weeks or two months from now, this flu season type virus will have passed and the joy of Spring will have arrived. Just like every flu season. However, don't misunderstand me. The extra caution and the remarkable response by the Chinese governments and people together to quell the spread of this virus was warranted because, yes it is correct that this corona virus is nastier than the usual annual flu bug, as was H1N1 in 2009. As of now, what we can confidently note the following regarding this Corona virus: This Corona virus is highly contagious, it spreads quite easily. It binds to lung tissue and so in particular, likes to cause pneumonia, that's what infection of lung tissue is. That's more severe than a respiratory infection which is only in your throat or bronchial tubes. The Corona virus currently has a 2% death rate. That's a lot higher, around 20x higher, than a more typical annual flu virus with a death rate of 0.1%. However, a 2% death rate is still much lower by comparison to the SARS virus which had a 9% death rate or the MERS virus with a really nasty 37% death rate. The Corona virus is causing severe symptoms in 10-15% of cases. 80% to 90% of deaths from this virus are happening in elderly patients, mostly with other existing health problems, not younger people. That characteristic by the way, is in contrast to the America 2009 H1N1 swine flu virus which in fact had a higher death rate amongst younger people including children rather than those over 60 years old. China identified and shared the Corona virus genome in record times, in only days and of course, immediately shared it with all international health and disease organizations. Medical researchers are already discovering that certain existing anti-viral medications seem to be effective against this Corona virus. It's impossible not to marvel at China's broad and aggressive domestic response directed by the provincial level governments to restrict movement, restrict transportation, restrict business for a period of time combined with the voluntary dutiful cooperation of its 1.3 billion citizens who are in the majority quietly staying at home these weeks to let the virus pass; this model response is already being hailed by the international community as a remarkable unprecedented response setting a new standard in understanding what is possible for future outbreaks in whatever country they may occur. Is it inconvenient and costly. You bet. Like I said, something's not right with the way humanity is responding to what's happening here. I haven't put my finger on it because well, its certainly complex and the world is upside down in many other ways that I also can't for the life of me understand or explain without ending up writing a very thick book. But I do know this: It needs to stop. This vicious, political, xenophobic racist attacks and smearing of all things China needs to stop. Its really not helping anyone in the political corridors of Washington nor is it doing anything to help the man on the street who is just concerned with taking care of his family. My family is originally from the Basilicata region of Italy, the little hillside Italian towns of Potenza and also, Grottola, which is just outside of Matera. They left their home country and moved to America where I was born, in Yonkers, New York. America became their home and it was my home until I left, too. Now over two decades ago, I left the United States, the country I was born in, the country that has plenty to admire and plenty to improve. But I left and I came to China and now China is my home. If you had asked me thirty years ago if this was my life plan on planet earth, I would have said you were nuts or a really bad fortune teller. But that's how it has turned out. I am truly blessed with my lovely Chinese wife and our family living here in Shenyang in China's northeast. You get my meaning? I am a mature adult like many with the powers of observation. I can easily see that whether we are talking about China or the United States or any other country, their societies and their governments have good points and bad points. The xenophobia needs to stop now. Whether in a couple of weeks or months later, this nasty flu type Corona virus will begin declining and the joy of Spring will arrive. Between now and then if you don't have anything good, anything supportive to say about China or Chinese people, how about you just keep your mouth shut. Mario Cavolo, Shenyang. ",

Concerns that Chinese companies could back out of contracts because of the coronavirus epidemic have slowed down spot crude oil and LNG sales into China, the world\u2019s top energy consumer, increasing global supplies and depressing prices of energy products. \u201cSome Chinese customers, at least one, are trying to use the coronavirus to say I have force majeure,\u201d Philippe Sauquet, head of Total\u2019s gas, renewables and power segment, said during the company\u2019s full-year results presentation on Thursday. \u201cWe have received one force majeure that we have rejected.\u201d Companies invoke force majeure when they cannot meet their contractual obligations because of circumstances beyond their control. Sauquet did not disclose the name of the buyer Total rejected a force majeure notice from. Reuters reported on Thursday that China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), the country\u2019s biggest importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), has declared force majeure on some prompt deliveries with at least three suppliers because of the rapid spread of the coronavirus, two sources said on Thursday. Total is one of the biggest suppliers of LNG to CNOOC, industry sources said. Last week, a Chinese international trade promotion agency said it would offer force majeure certificates to companies struggling with the fallout from the coronavirus epidemic to give to their overseas partners. Lawyers told Reuters that LNG contracts are typically governed by English law which spell out events that constitute a force majeure and some may include the epidemic clause. Serving the force majeure notice is the first step in a long-drawn out process, they said. The onus is also on buyers to prove that they are not physically able to receive the cargo to demonstrate a force majeure. For instance, if there are port closures or if workers are unable to get to the ports due to the virus. I love lines like: \u201c\u201cThere is absolutely no need to panic buy..\u201d , because what\u2019s the other side of that? You can trust us to tell you when there\u2019s a need to panic? But a government could never tell you to panic. Best version is \u201cThis is not the time to panic\u201d . And then you go: Okay, I\u2019ll watch some TV then, and I\u2019ll make sure I get my ten hours of sleep. But first thing in the morning\u2026. Panic Buying As Hong Kong Government Silent On Coming Quarantine Move Anxious Hongkongers scrambled on Thursday to stock up on essentials over fears that border restrictions to contain the coronavirus would choke off shipments, while the government provided scant details on the mandatory quarantine taking effect in less than 36 hours on arrivals from mainland China. As long queues formed at shops all over the city for the second straight day and people jostled to grab toilet and tissue paper, as well as rice and perishables, food suppliers sought to assure the public there was no need for hoarding. \u201cThere is absolutely no need to panic buy. We have always worked to ensure a stable supply of food and all these years, throughout all sorts of big events, we have never had a shortage,\u201d Thomas Ng Wing-yan, chairman of the Hong Kong Food Council, told a press conference. The fears, fed by online rumours, mounted when the government announced on Wednesday it would impose a 14-day quarantine on anyone entering from mainland China, sparking concerns that supplies would also be held up. But while the government said it would reveal more on the quarantine measures on Thursday, the day ended with no information forthcoming, as sources told the Post that Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor was still locked in meetings over facilities and details on implementation. Even as they gave assurances, representatives of rice, pork, egg, seafood, poultry and fruit-and-vegetable merchants urged the government to exempt cross-border truck drivers from the 14-day quarantine set to kick in on Saturday, to avert any delays in supplies reaching the city.

Coronavirus Kills \u2018Hero\u2019 Chinese Doctor Who Sounded Alarm A Chinese doctor who tried to warn the world about a new coronavirus died of the disease on Friday, prompting an outpouring of sorrow as the death toll passed 630 and Beijing declared a \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d on the rapidly spreading pathogen. Li Wenliang, 34, died in the early hours of the morning at the hospital where he worked and first raised the alarm about the new coronavirus in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, hospital officials said. An ophthalmologist, Li was one of eight people reprimanded by Wuhan police last month for spreading \u201cillegal and false\u201d information about the coronavirus, a flu-like pathogen that since triggered a global health emergency. His messages to a group of doctors on Chinese social media warning of a new \u201cSARS-like\u201d coronavirus \u2013 a reference to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which killed almost 800 people around the world in 2002-2003 \u2013 triggered the wrath of Wuhan police. China was accused of trying to cover up SARS. He was forced to sign a letter on Jan. 3 saying he had \u201cseverely disrupted social order\u201d and was threatened with criminal charges. The story of how China announced the death of Dr Li Wenliang & then allegedly told doctors to put his body on life support & say he was \u2018critical\u2019. A grotesque end to the story of a brave man who tried to warn about the coronavirus & has now died from it.

They partially blamed the Corona Virus outbreak. IEA forecasts drop in oil demand this quarter- first time in a decade\nThe seemingly never ending list of delays, disruptions, and cuts rolls on from retail to high technology. Even services are impacted as flights and train trips are canceled within and to and from China. While some technology-based services are provided over the Internet service, restaurants, training, and consulting, as examples, must be performed in person. Manufacturing operations require workers to be at the factory to produce products. Thus, manufacturing is much more acutely affected by quarantines, shutdowns, transportation disruption, and other government actions.\nIt is as if an economic tsunami is rolling over the global economy. China\u2019s economy was 18 % of world GDP in 2019. For most S & P 100 corporations, the Asian giant is their fastest growing market at 20 \u2013 30 % per year. Even more critical, China has become the hub of world manufacturing after entering the World Trade Organization in 2000. Over the past two decades, U.S. corporations have relocated manufacturing to China to leverage an inexpensive labor force and modern business infrastructure.\nSource: The Wall Street Journal \u2013 2/7/20\nPrior to the epidemic, world trade had begun to slow as a result of the China \u2013 U.S. trade war and other tariffs. World trade for the first time since the last recession has turned negative.\nSource: Haver Analytics, The Wall Street Journal, The Daily Shot \u2013 1/19/20\nBased on severity estimates, analysts have forecasted the impact on first-quarter China GDP growth. In the chart below from Fitch Ratings, growth for first quarter drops almost in half and for year growth drops to 5.2 % if containment is delayed:\nSources: The Wall Street Journal, The Daily Shot \u2013 2/6/20\nWhen news of the virus first was announced, the market sustained a quick modest decline. The next day, investors were reassured by official news from China and the World Health Organization that the virus could be contained. Market valuations bounced on optimism that the world economy would see little to no damage in the first quarter of 2020. Yet, there is growing skepticism that the official tolls of the virus are short of reality. Doctors report that at the epicenter of Wuhan that officials are grossly underestimating the number of people infected and dead. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine has an epidemic model indicating there will be at least 500,000 infections at the peak in a few weeks far greater than the present 45,000 officially reported.\nThe reaction, and not statements, of major governments to the epidemic hint that the insider information they have received is far worse and uncertain. U.S. global airlines have canceled flights to China until mid-March and 30 other carriers have suspended flights indefinitely \u2013 severely reducing business and tourist activities. The U.S. government has urged U.S. citizens to leave the country, flown embassy staff and families back to the U.S., and elevated the alert status of China to \u2018Do Not Travel\u2019 on par with Syria and North Korea. All of these actions have angered the Chinese government. While protecting U.S. citizens from the illness it adds stress to an already tense trade relationship. To reduce trade tension, China announced a relaxation of import tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. goods, reducing tariffs by 5 to 10 %. President Xi on a telephone call with President Trump committed to complete all purchases of U.S. goods on target by the end of the year while delaying shipments temporarily. It remains to be seen if uncontrolled events will drive a deeper trade wage between the U.S. and China.\nInside China, chaos in the supply chain operations is creating great uncertainty. Workers are being told to work from home and stay away from factories for at least for another week beyond the Lunar New Year and now well into late-February. Foxconn and Tesla announced plant openings on February 10 th , yet ramping up output is still an issue. It will be a challenge to staff factories as many workers are in quarantined cities and train schedules have been curtailed or canceled. Many factories are dependent on parts from other cities around the country that may have more severe restrictions on transportation and/or workers reporting to work. Thus, even when a plant is open, it is likely to be operating at limited capacity.\nOn February 7 th , the Federal Reserve announced that while the trade war pause has improved the global economy, it cautioned that the coronavirus posed a \u2018new threat to the world economy.\u2019 The Fed is monitoring the situation. The central bank of China infused CNY 2 trillion in the last four weeks to provide fresh liquidity. The liquidity will help financially stretched Chinese companies survive for a while, but they are unlikely to be able to continue operations unless production and sales return to pre epidemic levels quickly.\nWill the Federal Reserve really be able to buffer the supply chain disruption and sales declines in the first quarter of 2020? The Fed already seems overwhelmed, keeping a $1+ trillion yearly federal deficit under control and providing billions in repo financing to banks and hedge funds causing soaring prices in risk assets. While the Fed may be able to assist U.S. corporations with liquidity through a tough stretch of declining sales and supply chain disruptions, it cannot create sales or build products.\nPrior to the virus crisis, CEO Confidence was at a ten year low. Then, CEO confidence levels improved a little with the Phase One trade deal driving brighter business prospects for the coming year. Now, a possible black swan epidemic has entered the world economic stage creating extreme levels of sales and operational uncertainty. Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, expresses the anxiety many CEOs feel about trade:\n\u201c Because that issue (trade) is on the table, then everybody has a question mark around in some part of their business,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re in this strange economic time, we all know that.\u201d\nAdding to the uncertainty is a deteriorating political environment in China. During the first few weeks of December, local Wuhan officials denounced a doctor that was calling for recognition of the new virus. He later died of the disease, triggering a social media uproar over the circumstances of his treatment. Many Chinese people have posted on social media strident criticisms of the delayed government response. Academics have posted petitions for freedom of speech, laying the blame on government censors for making the virus outbreak worse. The wave of freedom calls is rising as Hong Kong protester\u2019s messages seem to be spreading to the mainland. The calls for freedom of speech and democracy are posing a major challenge to President Xi. Food prices skyrocketed by 20 % in January with pork prices rising 116 % adding to consumer concerns. Political observers see this challenge to government policies on par with the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. The ensuing massacre of protestors is still in the minds of many mainland people. As seems to be true of many of these events that it is not the crisis itself, but the reaction and ensuing waves of social disorder which drive a major economic impact .\nOxford Economics has forecast a slowdown in US GDP growth in the first quarter of 2020 to just .6 %\nSources: Oxford Economics, The Wall Street Journal, The Daily Shot \u2013 2/6/20\nWill U.S. GDP growth really be shaved by just .4 %? If we consider the compounding effect of the epidemic to disrupt both demand and supply, the social chaos in China challenging government authority (i.e., Hong Kong), and a lingering trade war \u2013 these factors all make a decline into a recession a real and growing possibility. We hope the epidemic can be contained quickly and lives saved with a return to a more certain world economy. Yet, 1930s historical records show rising world nationalism, trade wars, and the fracturing of the world order does not bode well for a positive outcome. Mohammed A. El-Arian. Chief Economic Advisor at Allianz in a recent Bloomberg opinion warns of a U shaped recession or worse an L :\n\u201c I worry that many analysts do not fully appreciate the notable differences between financial and economic sudden stops. Rather than confidently declare a V, economic modelers need more time and evidence to assess the impact on the Chinese economy and the related spillovers \u2013 a consideration that is made even more important by two observations. First, the Chinese economy was already in an unusually fragile situation because of the impact of trade tensions with the U.S. Second, it has been navigating a tricky economic development transition that has snared many countries before China in the \u201cmiddle income trap. All this suggests it is too early to treat the economic effects of the coronavirus on China and the global economy as easily containable, temporary and quickly reversible. Instead, analysts and modelers should respect the degree of uncertainty in play, including the inconvenient realization that the possibility of a U or, worse, an L for 2020 is still too high for comfort .\u201d\nPatrick Hill is the Editor of The Progressive Ensign , theprogressiveensign.com/ writes from the heart of Silicon Valley, leveraging 20 years of experience as an executive at firms like HP, Genentech, Verigy, Informatica, and Okta to provide investment and economic insights.",

        "content": "Chinese New Year decorations in a Toronto supermarket Chinese New Year is the most important cultural event for Chinese people in China, also for overseas Chinese around the world. Unfortunately, since the outbreak of the corona virus in China happening around the same time as Chinese New Year, many celebrations have been cancelled in numerous Chinese cities. In Toronto, Canada, there are two confirmed cases of people who have contracted this virus upon their return from China recently. Our Canadian government is doing an excellent job in tracking and contacting other passengers who sat within three rows of these two passengers on the plane. Some people in Toronto are reacting quickly and irrationally to the virus situation. We never thought of wearing any masks but I have learned that surgical masks are all sold out in our pharmacy stores in Toronto. Some people are avoiding social gatherings, church services; they just stay home. As for us, we live our lives as normal. A lady prepared the special food for our church new year dinner. Last week, on Chinese New Year's day, we went to a family New Year dinner with our brother-in-law's family, and attended two church services and a church New Year dinner. A couple of days ago, we took our Mom out for our weekly luncheon at a nice Chinese restaurant. A Lion Dance team performing in a Toronto restaurant Not long after we started eating, there was the lion dance team coming into the restaurant and performing for the patrons. The Lion Dancers came to our table and performed. We had two New Year red packets and attracted the dragon to come to our table. My sister gave our mom a red lucky packet. My mom was tickle pink. She kissed the lucky red packet! She was happy! I also met my sister for lunch last Monday and another friend for a drink in the evening. Life is normal for us! I was so glad to see John Tory, Toronto's Mayor and Jim Karygiannis, a city councilor and his other fellow councilors attending a Solidarity Dinner in Toronto on tonight's evening news. Actions speak louder than words! While some Torontonians are nervous and staying away from churches, restaurants and shopping malls, our elected officials' presence demonstrates their support for the Chinese community and business. Bravo to most of the inhabitants of Toronto who are not affected by the bad news on the other side of the continent and live their lives fully and normally! ",

        "content": "Clover Biopharmaceuticals, a global clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel and transformative biologic therapies, announced today that it has successfully produced its trimeric Spike-protein (\u201cS-Trimer\u201d) subunit vaccine candidate for 2019-nCoV via a mammalian cell expression system. In addition, Clover scientists have used the newly obtained S-Trimer and successfully detected antigen-specific antibody in sera from multiple fully recovered patients who were previously infected by the virus. Importantly, Clover is the first company in the world to disclose a 2019-nCoV vaccine candidate that can successfully be recognized by antibodies produced by previously-infected patients, supporting that S-Trimer has preserved the native structure of the viral spike (S) protein and thus may elicit a protective-immune response as a vaccine. This work was carried out with the support of leadership teams from Chengdu Hi-Tech Park and Chengdu Clinical Center for Public Health in China.\nSimilar to other enveloped RNA viruses such as HIV, RSV and Influenza, 2019-nCoV is also an RNA virus that has a trimeric spike (S) protein on its viral envelope. The trimeric S protein of 2019-nCoV is responsible for binding to host cell surface receptor ACE2 and subsequent viral entry. Symptoms in infected patients include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties, and it can be fatal.\nUpon knowing the genomic DNA sequence of this newly identified 2019-nCoV last month, Clover scientists immediately started designing the viral S-protein construct and completed its gene synthesis. Utilizing our patented Trimer-Tag \u00a9 technology, Clover has produced a S-Trimer subunit vaccine that resembles the native trimeric viral spike via a rapid mammalian cell-culture based expression system. Having one of the largest in-house, commercial-scale cGMP biomanufacturing capabilities in China, Clover could potentially be able to rapidly scale-up and produce large-quantities of a new coronavirus vaccine.\nClover has previously developed recombinant subunit-Trimer vaccines for RSV and Influenza viruses utilizing its Trimer-Tag \u00a9 technology and has demonstrated that they are able to evoke protective neutralizing antibody responses in multiple animal models.\n\u201cI am very excited that Clover has achieved high-level expression of the native-like trimeric viral Spike protein (S-Trimer) in mammalian cells in record time, and importantly, we have used the newly-obtained vaccine candidate to successfully detect viral S protein-specific antibodies from the sera of multiple patients who recently recovered from 2019-nCoV infection in China. The implication of this discovery is that it not only has validated the correct conformation of our S-Trimer subunit vaccine candidate, but also further supports that the new 2019-nCov virus is indeed the culprit for the current epidemic, since all previous diagnosis for the viral infections have been based on nucleic acid detection. This important finding forms a solid foundation for the continued rapid development of S-Trimer vaccine through pilot production, preclinical efficacy and safety studies, followed by human clinical trials and subsequent large-scale production.\u201d said Dr. Peng Liang, co-founder, Chairman and President of Clover. \u201cWe remain confident that Clover can be among one of the first companies to develop a successful vaccine to contain the 2019-nCoV epidemic, as well as any future outbreaks of similar coronaviruses\u201d.\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the rapid progress of our S-Trimer vaccine development for 2019-nCoV and hope to support global efforts in fighting this epidemic,\u201d said Joshua Liang, Chief Strategy Officer and Board Director at Clover. \u201cTo this end, we recognize that collaborations will be critical to accelerating the development of a successful new vaccine in times of emergency, and we invite any interested regulatory, academic or industry parties to contact us for this noble common cause.\u201d\nAbout Clover Biopharmaceuticals\nClover Biopharmaceuticals is a global, clinical-stage, research-based biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing transformative biologic therapies, with a focus on oncology and autoimmune diseases, as well as viral vaccines. Having raised more than US$ 100 million in total capital since 2016, Clover is utilizing its proprietary Trimer-Tag \u00a9 technology platform to develop novel biologics targeting trimerization-dependent pathways. Additionally, Clover is leveraging its in-house cGMP biomanufacturing capabilities to develop select biosimilars. For more information, please visit our website: www.cloverbiopharma.com . www.cloverbiopharma.com .\nAbout Trimer-Tag \u00a9 Technology\nTrimer-Tag \u00a9 is an innovative drug development platform which allows the production of novel, covalently-trimerized fusion proteins. Many major disease targets are trimerization-dependent such as the tumor necrosis factor superfamily (involved in extrinsic apoptosis, immune co-stimulation and inflammation) as well as enveloped RNA virus antigens responsible for entry into host cells. Clover is using Trimer-Tag technology to create trimerized fusion proteins that are able to effectively target these previously undruggable pathways.\nAbout Wuhan Coronavirus 2019-nCoV\nThe new coronavirus identified in late 2019 has been officially named by WHO as 2019-nCoV on January 12, 2020. Coronavirus is a family of enveloped RNA viruses that include MERS and SARS, both of which caused serious human infections of respiratory system. 2019-nCov has never before been found in human, and since this outbreak was first reported in late-2019, the virus has so far infected over 40,000 people and has caused over 900 reported deaths (as of February 9, 2020). It has been declared a Public Health Emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). Currently there is no vaccine available for the virus. Contacts",

        "content": "Corona Virus Warning : How importing Chinese Labourers Led to the most deadly disease event in Modern history Posted on February 7, 2020\nCorona Virus Warning : How importing Chinese Labourers Led to the most deadly disease event in Modern History\nAccording to Professor Mark Humphries (Wilfrid Laurier University) the world-wide flu which killed more than 50 million people originated in China in the winter of 1917-18. This was near the end of World War 1. His research looks at three often-cited origins of the disease : (1) The U.S.; (2) France and (3) China. He concludes that China is the site that makes most sense.\nThe insights provided by Professor Humphries in his 2014 research should have accentuated the absolute necessity for health checks on immigrants/migrants coming to Canada\u2014particularly at this time of the Corona virus. A large percentage of Canada\u2019s current immigrants come from China and India whose environments have been described respectively as an \u201cenvironmental catastrophe\u201d and an \u201cenvironmental disaster\u201d. Let us translate for the benefit of uninformed Trudeau, ethnic Chinese NDP MP Jenny Kwan, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh and a host of equally uninformed MP\u2019s and other politicians : The terms \u201cEnvironmental catastrophe\u201d and \u201cenvironmental disaster\u201d mean \u201cbreeding grounds for viruses\u201d. A large percentage of Canada\u2019s immigrants come from those breeding grounds.\nHowever, instead of recognizing the absolute necessity for health checks, Kwan and many other politicians in the past few years have advocated for the abolition of health checks. Consider also that Trudeau \u2018s foolish declaration in 2015 that \u201cCanada would take all refugees\u201d has resulted in Canada taking thousands of fake refugees from Ebola-riddled Nigeria. Finally, note that Trudeau also mined the Russian province of Chechnya in search of gays. Those people are potential carriers of HIV.\nHere are some important details in Professor Humphries\u2019 research that Trudeau, all MP\u2019s and other politicians should note :\n(1) The deadliest epidemics in history have been those which occurred when previously isolated populations came into sustained contact with one another. The three worst were The Plague of Justinian in the Byzantine Empire (541-542 AD), the Black Death in Europe (1347-1400 AD) and the smallpox epidemic in the New \u201cWorld\u201dpopulations (1500 AD +).\n(2) As early as 1914, \u201cpublic health officials feared that a global war might bring new diseases home to civilian populations.\u201d In August, 1914, Canada\u2019s future Surgeon-General, Dr. Guy Carleton Jones, ominously wrote : \u201cThe trail of infected armies leaves a sad tale of sickness amongst the women and children and non-combatants.\u201d (P.56) According to The Canadian Encyclopedia, the Spanish flu (really the Chinese flu) killed about 40,000 Canadians.\n(3) The 1918 Flu started in China but it spread around the world because formerly-isolated, virus-carrying Chinese came into contact with Canadians, Americans, British, French, other Europeans and then Africans who had had little previous contact with one another.\n(4) The contact between the Chinese and other populations happened because the British/French allies in WW1 against Germany needed a large number of workers to do mostly non-combatant work (loading and unloading ships, etc,) behind the front lines of World War 1. The British and the French negotiated with China to bring large numbers of Chinese to Europe. The workers were referred to as the \u201cChinese Labour Corps\u201d When British authorities saw signs of health dangers, they could have reduced the inflow, but felt committed to the Chinese.\n(5) The British asked Canada to help with transporting the Chinese to Europe. Canada agreed. Canada soon accepted the Chinese at its west coast ports (William Head near Victoria first and then Vancouver). It then put the Chinese on CPR trains which took the Chinese to Halifax or to U.S. ports. The Canadian government kept the agreement completely secret. It housed the Chinese in its quarantine facility at William Head. It did examine the Chinese for diseases such as trachoma (a contagious inflammation of the eyelids) and external parasites. It also looked out for signs of flu. When the Chinese were considered ready to leave, they were taken to Vancouver and transferred to trains. It took many cross-country trips to send all the Chinese out. Each train car was guarded by Canadian soldiers and sealed. Dr. James Morton, in his book titled \u201cIn The Sea of Sterile Mountains\u201d, says that about 200,000 Chinese Labour Corps members were transported to Canada\u2019s east coast. (P. 229) The trains stopped in Petawawa, Ontario to give the Chinese labourers a rest and then resumed the trip to Halifax. The Chinese labourers were then moved on to ships which took them to southern England. From England, they were moved to France. One big question that Professor Humphries does not deal with is this : What role did the guards play in spreading the disease when they left their work? Humphries says that during 1917-18 alone, 94,000 Chinese workers were shipped by the British from China. (P.72)\n(6) Professor Humphries says : \u201cWe now know that influenza is caused by a virus which finds its natural home in wild ducks and only infects humans when it crosses the species barrier, sometimes directly passing from birds to people, sometimes passing through an intermediary species such as pigs or horses. When an animal virus becomes a human disease, it has the potential to cause a pandemic because people have no prior immunity. There have been five such episodes in the past 125 years (1889, 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009); the 1918 virus was by far the most severe, and researchers are still not sure why.\u201d (P. 58)\n(7) As with the corona virus now, Chinese medical officials and political authorities downplayed and covered up the extent and severity of the influenza in Northern China where the Chinese labourers lived. They resented the concerns of an international legation (French and British mostly). When one of their own, a Chinese Doctor Wu who had been trained in Europe, agreed with the international legation, they fired him.\n(8) The records of the majority of Chinese Labour Corps units do not appear to have survived in (Canadian ?) archives, but references to the Chinese Labour Corps in the files of other units are informative. The first reports of influenza refer directly to members of the Chinese Labour Corps (April, 2018) .\n(9) British records reported that an epidemic of influenza was in progress in Plymouth, England in late July of 1918. CLC members were there in large numbers. An Australian-built ship, the Mantua which left Plymouth on a trip to Freeport in British west Africa, soon reported that 176 sailors were sick with influenza and pneumonia. Ten sailors died and the disease spread in the city of Freeport. From there, the disease spread down the west coast of Africa. Other ships leaving Europe spread the disease to U.S. ports such as Boston. The disease then spread to all of Massachussetts and New York State. Over the next few months, 675,000 Americans died of influenza or pneumonia.\n(10) The mobilization of the Chinese Labour Corps moved tens of thousands from the interior of northern China where a confirmed outbreak of a virulent respiratory disease had occurred. Let us repeat : The disease eventually killed more then 50 million people. The term \u201cSpanish flu\u201d was used not because the flu originated in Spain, but because Spain kept detailed records on the flu.\n(11) In Humphries words, \u201cThe result (of the migration of the Chinese Labour Corps) was the most deadly disease event in history.\u201d (P.81)\n(12) Would Canadians be far off in labeling Trudeau, his \u201cDiversity is Canada\u2019s strength\u201d policy and a host of Canada\u2019s politicians as Canada\u2019s real \u201cNational Viruses\u201d?",

Indian steel makers could use this as an opportunity to increase their exports to Southeast Asia which relies on supplies from China.\nLeading Indian steel company Jindal Steel and Power said that a majority of its steel exports are going to China, suggesting a reversal of trend wherein China was said to be dumping its steel in India.\nIn an interesting turn of events, leading steel manufacturer Jindal Steel and Power is now exporting 80% of its steel production. A majority of these exports are going to China, which is currently trying to get its economy back on track after being hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe Indian steel industry has had a rollercoaster run in the last few years.\nAccording to data provided by the Ministry of Steel, India had imported excessively between 2015 and 2016. It became a net exporter in FY2017 and 2018. In FY 2019, the balance turned in favour of imports yet again.\nHere\u2019s how India has exported and imported steel in FY 2020\nAccording to government data , India has been a net exporter of steel with exports exceeding imports by 18% in FY2020. Gaining from this trend reversal is one of India\u2019s leading manufacturers - Jindal Steel, with a capacity of 6.55 million tonne per annum (MTPA).\n\u201cRight now, we are exporting 80% of the steel that we are producing, and the majority of that is going to China,\u201d Naveen Jindal , chairman of JSPL told Business Insider.\nHe further revealed that his company\u2019s steel plants are operating at 75-80% capacity in the last two months. \u201cAll the time we say that China has been dumping steel in India, but right now we are able to export to China,\u201d he quipped.\nJindal is betting on construction activity picking up to improve its sales in India\nThough its export market has improved, the shutdown of businesses in India is affecting JSPL too.\nIn 2020, Jindal Steel and Power\u2019s stock peaked on February 6 at \u20b9197.75. Since then, it has seen a massive crash, plummeting to as low as \u20b963.20 on April 3. It has slowly picked up since the crash, but it is still more than 50% down from its February peak.\nTo improve his domestic sales, Jindal is banking on construction activity resuming after the end of lockdown.\n\u201cBefore monsoons, people like to complete their civil constructions. We hope that these kinds of constructions will start (after lockdown ends),\u201d Jindal said.",

        "content": "Building rates have not continued to rise from the turn of the year and from January and will fall somewhat again in February. This is also noteworthy because last year there was a slight upward trend in interest rates from the very low level. On average, according to the index of the Internet portal Biallo, banks are currently demanding around 0.75 percent for construction loans with ten years of fixed interest rates, after 0.82 percent in January. FMH financial advice comes to an average of 0.73 percent, after 0.83 percent in January. Among other things, there is a certain amount of uncertainty behind this development on the financial markets. \u201cThe fear of the corona virus lowers building rates,\u201d says Max Herbst of the FMH financial advice. Building rates followed the ten-year yield on the federal bond, which had fallen from minus 0.17 to minus 0.41 percent within a few weeks before rising slightly again to minus 0.39 percent. Fall is due to uncertainty in the financial markets, which he can only explain by the spread of the corona virus, said Herbst. J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer, chief economist at Commerzbank, also said: \u201cSince the corona epidemic became the focus of the markets, the yield of the trend-setting ten-year federal bond has fallen by 0.25 percentage points.\u201d Let yields rise little. \u201cThis may also have been due to the fact that German economic indicators such as industrial production or incoming orders had recently disappointed massively,\u201d says Kr\u00e4mer. The data in the rest of the euro area were also weak, said the economist: \u201cIn this environment, calls for an end to the loose ECB policy are in vain.\u201d No reason for a change in monetary policy The rise in interest rates for building money in December and January was \u201conly of short duration\u201d, the Interhyp placement portal also states. \u201cThe current monetary policy of the central banks supports the overall low interest rate level,\u201d said board member Mirjam Mohr. \u201cIn addition, global uncertainties repeatedly lead to increased demand for secure investments such as federal bonds and, as a result, to low building interest rates.\u201d Interhyp predicts that nothing will likely change that quickly either: \u201cThose willing to build will continue to find favorable financing conditions.\u201d A Sparkassen direct bank is cheap FMH-Finanzberatung currently names 1822direkt, the direct bank of Frankfurter Sparkasse, as a cheap provider of construction loans with a ten-year fixed interest rate, with 0.62 percent effective interest per year for a loan of over 300,000 euros with a purchase price of 400,000 euros and 3 percent repayment. Degussa Bank asked for a comparable loan of 0.67 percent, Santander 0.72 percent and BB Bank 0.73 percent. Postbank demands 0.74 percent and ING 0.77 percent.",

This is the 6th time WHO has declared a PHEIC since the International Health Regulations (IHR) came into force in 2005.\nThe Director-General accepted the advice given by the IHR Emergency Committee, which had reconvened on 30 January. The advice includes temporary recommendations for China, other countries and the global community.\nBy declaring the outbreak a PHEIC, WHO has emphasized the urgent need to coordinate international efforts to investigate and better understand 2019-nCoV, to minimize the threat in affected countries and to reduce the risk of further international spread. \u201cWe are all in this together and we can only stop it together,\u201d the Director-General emphasized. What happens when a PHEIC is declared?\nDeclaring a PHEIC will ensure continued support to the response in China and accelerated preparedness in all countries.\nWhen a PHEIC is declared, the Director-General issues temporary recommendations under the IHR (2005), including obligations for countries to provide sufficient public health rationale and justification to WHO about any additional measures beyond what WHO recommends. This is critical to ensure the international response is evidence-based, measured and balanced, so that unnecessary interference with travel and trade is avoided.\nThe PHEIC also enhances global coordination, cooperation and solidarity. It increases transparency and support to countries with weaker health systems, and accelerates research and development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. Temporary recommendations for all countries\nIn addition to temporary recommendations to China to continue its robust response, the WHO Director-General issued temporary recommendations under the IHR (2005). All countries should be ready to contain any introduction of the virus and its spread through active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing, and prevention. They should also be ready to share full data with WHO. Countries should place emphasis on: reducing human infection, and prevention of secondary transmission and international spread; contributing to the international response through multisectoral communication and collaboration; participating actively in increasing knowledge on the virus and the disease; advancing research. Recommendations for the global community\nAs this is a new coronavirus, the global community should continue to demonstrate solidarity and cooperation. Such cooperation entails supporting each other to: identify the source of the new virus determine its full potential for human-to-human transmission prepare for potential importation of cases conduct research on therapeutics and vaccines.\nThe global community should also provide support to low- and middle-income countries in their response to this event, and facilitate their access to diagnostics, potential vaccines and therapeutics.",

Your pet has direct exposure (live in the same household) to a known COVID-19 positive person. 2. Your pet is showing signs of respiratory illness. 3. Your pet has received diagnostics for other causes of symptoms of Upper Respiratory Infection such as a respiratory panel. According to the CDC, there is no evidence that people can get COVID-19 from pets. The best place for your animal is inside the home they know and love. If you aren\u2019t feeling well but are still able to provide care for your pet, please keep them at home with you where they\u2019re most comfortable. With your whole family on board and a plan in place, you\u2019ll feel better about your pet\u2019s safety knowing they\u2019re in good hands no matter what challenges may arise. In addition, keeping area animal shelters free of long-term care animals allows them to be better prepared for the onset of kitten season, stray pets and animal care cases that require immediate attention.\n",

Meanwhile, the most traded contract copper metal price on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) rose 0.3% to 45,850 yuan (6,565.85 USD / ton).\nOn LME, aluminum price dropped by 0.3% to USD 1,743 / ton, nickel price by 0.7% to USD 13,195 / ton and lead price by 1.2% to USD 1,869 / ton. On the SHFE, aluminum prices fell 0.3% to 13,680 yuan / ton and nickel prices fell 0.2% to 10,450 yuan / ton.\nOn February 13, after the Hubei provincial government changed the method of statistics on the number of people infected with the virus, the number of new infections there jumped to 14,840 by the end of February 12, nearly 9 times higher. times the number of cases on 11/2. The number of people killed by the new Corona virus on February 12, also increased to a record 242 - double the previous day.\nHowever, in contrast to the usual reaction, the price of copper metal on the international market still increased yesterday (February 13). Specifically, closing the session yesterday, copper prices copper after 3 months on the floor LME increased 0.5% to 5,790 USD / ton.\nKieran Clancy, a market analyst from economic economics research firm Capital Economics , explained that the increase in the number of cases and deaths from disease is mainly due to China changing statistical methods. This reflects the increasing spread of disease. Therefore, the market did not react too negatively to new shocking numbers on the disease.\nCopper prices have fallen nearly 10% in the past four weeks due to market concerns that the Chinese economy has stalled because of an outbreak of the Corona virus that will drive the demand for copper and industrial metals. other dropped.\nHowever, the price of this metal is tending to start to rebound in recent sessions when the developments show that the Corona virus epidemic may be gradually under control. On Feb. 10, a senior Chinese health official said the disease would probably be extinguished by April this year.\nKieran Clancy, a market analyst, also said that the market is shifting its focus from monitoring the impact of the Corona virus epidemic to the demand for metal to Chinese disease control efforts. .\nGood disease control will limit disruptions in manufacturing activities in China, thereby supporting the recovery of copper metal prices. China is currently the largest consumer of industrial metals in the world.",

Together with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the China CDC and National Medical Product Administration (NMPA), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the U.S. National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and along with individual researchers and clinicians, Gilead is focused on contributing our antiviral expertise and resources to help patients and communities fighting 2019-nCoV.\nRemdesivir is not yet licensed or approved anywhere globally and has not been demonstrated to be safe or effective for any use. At the request of treating physicians, and with the support of local regulatory agencies, who have weighed the risks and benefits of providing an experimental drug with no data in 2019-nCoV, Gilead has provided remdesivir for use in a small number of patients with 2019-nCoV for emergency treatment in the absence of any approved treatment options.\nGilead is working with health authorities in China to establish a randomized, controlled trial to determine whether remdesivir can safely and effectively be used to treat 2019-nCoV. We are also expediting appropriate laboratory testing of remdesivir against 2019-nCoV samples.\nWhile there are no antiviral data for remdesivir that show activity against 2019-nCoV at this time, available data in other coronaviruses give us hope. Remdesivir has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity in animal models against the viral pathogens MERS and SARS, which are coronaviruses that are structurally similar to 2019-nCoV. There are also limited clinical data available from the emergency use of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with Ebola virus infection.\nGilead is committed to supporting the global health community to quickly and effectively respond to serious and life-threatening viral outbreaks worldwide.'\nAbout Gilead Sciences\nGilead Sciences is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative medicines in areas of unmet medical need.

It involves transferring antibodies from one individual to a blood-matched recipient in order to fight an infection. The Food and Drug Administration recently fast-tracked approval of its use as an investigational treatment on those who are very sick from COVID-19.\nBayhealth administered plasma to its first COVID-19 patient recently and is currently seeking donors for a convalescent plasma bank program offered in partnership through the Blood Bank of Delmarva.\nBayhealth Critical Care and Pulmonary Medicine physician Dr. Pedro Dammert, MD, said that recently published clinical studies show good clinical outcomes with plasma therapy and they\u2019re eager to use this promising treatment on more individuals with COVID-19 infections. \u201cEach donation can provide up to four units of plasma that could help two or three sick patients,\u201d said Dr. Dammert, MD. \u201cPlasma donation is a safe and cost-free way for those who\u2019ve recovered from COVID-19 to give back and potentially save lives.\u201d\nOne Bayhealth employee, Lindsey Locke, wgi recently became a plasma donor, shared how rewarding the experience was.\n\u201cI was really excited for my plasma donation appointment. I definitely like to help people\u2014that\u2019s why I became a certified nursing assistant,\u201d said Locke. \u201cWorking in the hospital, it was heartbreaking to see patients so sick from COVID-19. I actually felt a sense of guilt that I didn\u2019t get very sick from it, so I knew I wanted to donate my plasma to help those that were suffering more. I hope as many others that are able to can give back by doing the same.\u201d\nCandidates for the convalescent plasma bank program are individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 and have recovered and been symptom-free for at least 14 days, and who meet other typical blood bank requirements. Donors can give plasma multiple times at appropriate time intervals. All plasma donations will go to a general pool to be used for patients at Bayhealth as well as other healthcare facilities who obtain blood products from the Blood Bank of Delmarva. This program is sponsored through a nationwide research initiative at the Mayo Clinic and federally financed so there is no cost to the donor, the recipient or to Bayhealth.\nFor more details on this program or if you\u2019re interested in being a plasma donor, please contact Coronavirus Management Team member Holly Dapias, RN, at 302-612-1862.

A novel coronavirus (2019) was identified as the causative virus by Chinese authorities on 7 January.\nDr. Fallah said while the cause of pneumonia seems to be a novel coronavirus, transmission potential and modes of transmission remain unclear. Therefore, he noted, \u201cIt would be prudent to reduce the general risk of acute respiratory infections while traveling in or from affected areas.\u201d\nDr. Fallah indicated that the MoH through the NPHIL will be strict about health screenings of airplane passengers arriving from Wuhan at the Roberts International Airport (RIA).\nHe noted that based on available information, the World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend any restriction of travel or trade to and from China. \u201cMeanwhile, Liberia will continue to strengthen preparedness for health emergencies in line with the International Health Regulations (2005) at the airports,\u201d said Fallah.\nDr. Fallah: \u201cThere is no specific treatment for disease caused by the novel coronavirus yet. However, supportive care for infected persons can be highly effective.\u201d\nHe further disclosed that current statistics and reports, as of 21 January 2020, have unveiled a total of 314 confirmed cases for novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) including six deaths that were also reported to WHO globally from China.\nHe clarified that of the 314 cases reported, 309 cases were reported from China, two from Thailand, one from Japan and one from the Republic of South Korea; stressing that cases in Thailand, Japan, and South Korea were exported from Wuhan City, China; and of the 309 confirmed cases in China, 270 cases were confirmed from Wuhan; the 270 cases he said, 51 cases are severely ill and 12 are in critical conditions.\nDr Fallah also added that the United States has confirmed its first case arriving from Wuhan, China. He said many of the initial cases were thought to have contacted the virus through animal-to-human transmission as it has been established.\n\u201cThe Global surveillance is being established and it is expected that more cases will be reported over the next weeks,\u201d he quoted the reports.\nCoronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, and cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, an infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death.\nWuhan city is a major transport hub in China. Given the heavy population movements, cases are expected to significantly increase during the Chinese New Year in the last week of January. The risk of cases being reported from elsewhere is increased.\nMeanwhile, Dr. Fallah said that the NPHIL is currently coordinating with partners to continuously assess and manage the risk of importation.\n\u201cThe port health services have been placed on the alert and have heightened screening measures at the point of entry and other public health measures for self-protection,\u201d he noted.\nHowever, the authority at NPHIL has urged citizens to avoid close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections. It has further cautioned citizens to frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.\nNPHIL also stressed the need to avoid close contact with live or dead farm or wild animals; adding that travelers with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette by maintaining distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands. Wuhan City is a major transport hub in China, serving direct flights to at least 5 continents.\nWuhan is a major manufacturing city in China with a heavy focus on automobile and medical equipment. As a major transportation hub, Wuhan is one of the stops on two of the main long-distance high-speed railway lines: Beijing-Guangzhou (from north to south) and Shanghai-Chengdu high-speed railway (from east to west). According to information on Flightconnections.com, Wuhan Airport services non-stop scheduled passenger flights to 109 destinations in 20 countries.\nA history of travel to or from a person who lived in Wuhan, Hubei Province China in the last 14 days before symptom onset; The public is advised to remain calm. Travelers from Liberia to Wuhan, Guangdong, Beijing, and Shanghai are advised to avoid contact with sick people, animals (alive or dead), and animal markets. Travelers from China to Liberia may be asked questions upon arrival by the port health officers at the points of entry.\nDr. Fallah who earlier assured citizens of NPHIL\u2019s commitment, however, said its partners are fully committed as well as strengthening the preparedness and response to infectious disease outbreak in the country. \u201cInformation will be shared with the public as it becomes available,\u201d he declared.\nIn a related development, the Chief Medical & Scientific Officer of Molecular Pathogen Diagnostics Shufflex Biomed, Dr. Dougbeh Chris Nyan, quoting the Minister of National Health Commission of China, Li Bin, said that the virus has now killed 9 people and infected 440 people across mainland China.\nIn a letter to Dr. Fallah dated January 21, 2020, Dr Nyan said the World Health Organization (WHO) has also reported that the virus has reached 5 countries, including the United States where the first confirmed case was announced on January 21, 2020. \u201cI suggest an immediate proactive approach aimed at erecting requisite preventive measures,\u201d DR. Nyan said in his communication to NPHIL. ",

        "content": "Dr.Dinesh Corona virus comes from the family of virus which include other viruses such as MERS, SARS, as the milder variance causing common cold, medical consensus at this moment is novel corona virus is more transmissible, but appears less deadly than SARS, evidence suggests that rate of human to human transmission of this virus appears to be higher than that of SARS, for now the evidence also suggest that transmission is mostly via droplets emitted from an infected person over a short distance, such as when a person coughs or sneezes. If these droplets come in contact with eyes, nose or mouth of an individual directly or indirectly through hands come into contact with these droplets the individual may become affected, there is no evidence to suggest the virus is airborne. The novel corona virus is transmitted through surface contact, when a person sneezes or cough the droplets falls into surfaces of tables and chairs and virus may remain alive for up to few days, when someone touches the surfaces, virus can be transferred in his hand and if he then rub his eyes or nose without washing his hands, he may become affected. So we should wash hands. The most effective is to practice good personal hygiene, we should regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid touching our face with our hands, these may sound simple but they are very difficult to do because all of us touch our faces all the time, so it is simple but extremely difficult but is actually very affective in preventing all kinds of infection, potential infection from asymptomatic person in fact is less likely to be from coughing or sneezing directly because they don\u2019t have symptoms, but more likely by touching contaminated surfaces for which masks offer no protection. Wearing a mask when we are well, often gives us a false sense of security instead and we are more likely to touch our faces when we constantly adjust our masks, which is one way the disease spreads at the same time, we need to protect others our loved ones friends, colleagues that we come into contact with, if we are sick we should rest and recover at home as far as possible, if we need to go out to see a doctor we should wear a surgical mask to protect others so this is when mask is needed. No need to buy masks, unless and until the doctors recommends, do report if the pharmacy charges excess rates for masks or gives duplicate N95 masks. Any person suggestive of corona virus should be confined at home for a period of 14 days and avoid close contact with public and other members in the family, stay home, preferably isolate himself or herself in a separate and well ventilated room, avoid common areas frequented by other members of the family, avoid close contact, if inevitable, maintain at least one hand distance avoid handshaking and wash hands frequently with soap and water or use hand sanitizer, take plenty of fluids, cover mouth & nose with tissue or handkerchief when coughing and sneezing. Monitor your health for appearance of symptoms like fever, cough and or breathing difficulty. If you develop any of these symptoms. Please do contact government health facility. All non- essential travel to china to be avoided, if you feel sick on a flight, while travelling back to India, inform the airline crew about illness, follow the directions of airline crew while disembarking. Immediately report facts to airport health office/immigration office & helpline number 011-23978046 also.

        "content": "A new, potential pandemic is developing in Asia, and has already spread to the United States and parts of Asia. Chinese officials recently quarantined a city of nearly 12 million souls to prevent the disease from spreading from its point of origin.\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is monitoring the situation and issuing updates as they come available. According to the CDC, the disease in question is \"2019-nCoV\" a \"novel coronavirus.\" The virus was first detected in the city of Wuhan in central China. The disease has spread rapidly with Chinese experts confirming that it spreads from person-to-person. The Chinese have been applauded for reacting to the outbreak with impressive speed, sequencing the genome of the virus in late 2019.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of common viruses, some of which can mutate and become dangerous. They are often found in animals, and some strains can jump from animals to humans.\nOfficials suspect the outbreak of the disease occurred in a large live-animal meat market where animals are sold alive or slaughtered for human consumption. However, since the initial detection of the virus, new cases have appeared which have no link to the suspected marketplace. This strongly suggests that human-to-human transmission is occurring.\nChinese officials announced on Jan 22 they were quarantining the city of Wuhan. The quarantine is intended to slow or prevent further spread of the disease. Already, at least one case has been detected in the United States.\nAbout 470 cases have been confirmed, nearly all cases in China. Individual cases have been reported in Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, and the United States. There are unconfirmed reports of a case in Mexico. At least 17 deaths have been attributed to the disease.\nHowever, experts warn the official statistics often lag behind the actual numbers. Many cases are probably still unreported, and some deaths may have occurred and are being attributed or unreported. The number of infected persons could be in the thousands.\nBritish professor Neil Ferguson was quoted in The Sun, a British Tabloid, that the number of deaths appears to be \"roughly the same as for the Spanish flu epidemic.\" That disease killed 50 million people around the world in just one year. By comparison, four years of warfare (World War I) produced only 35 million casualties.\nIt is certain that many more deaths are to come and the only question is if officials can halt the spread of the disease before it goes global. Screening centers have been established at airports around the world. Travel to and from China, and possibly much of Asia may be stopped if the disease keeps spreading.\nAt present, it appears that older people and people with underlying health conditions are at greatest risk. It is unclear how easily the virus spreads from person-to-person. The virus causes pneumonia in some patients, which is sometimes fatal. Officials are still learning about the disease.\nThe best advice is to avoid travel, especially to the central region of China where the outbreak is ongoing. If the disease spreads, all people will need to take precautions. Minimizing unnecessary travel and human contact is the first step. Those who are sick should remain home, unless their condition deteriorates and requires medical attention. Face masks and handwashing are critical to preventing infection. Hand sanitizer also helps.\nAt this time, there is no need for general alarm, but all people should pay attention to updates from official sources in the weeks and months ahead. If the disease does spread, public notices and directives will be issued. It is important that all people follow such recommendations.\nEven the worst pandemic diseases eventually \"burn\" themselves out. But periodically, diseases emerge that have the right combination of contagiousness and virulence. When that happens, as has happened many times in history, millions of people may die. Such diseases tend to emerge in densely populated areas, especially where there is close contact between humans and animals. This is why many new viruses seem to emerge from China. It is a product of population density.\nPandemic diseases have changed the course of history. Notable examples include the Black Death between 1347-1354, and the Colombian Exchange between the Americas and the rest of the world. The Colombian Exchange resulted in the deaths of about 100 million native people as a result of the cocktail of diseases which European settlers carried with them.",

It is a concerted effort being taken by our different agencies, to ensure that an outbreak is avoided,\u201d he said.\nAndanar said the PCOO has activated its Laging Handa communications team to provide information and updates from government agencies regarding the 2019-nCoV through all government media platforms to keep the public informed.\nLocal government\nThe Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) has advised local government units to create their respective coronavirus Task Force to contain the spread of the disease at the local level.\nThe said Task Force will ensure that local health authorities have the necessary equipment and gadgets; that local health workers are trained in the prevention, control, and containment of the virus; and that those suspected of the 2019-nCoV are referred and transported to Department of Health (DOH)- designated-coronavirus referral center or hospitals.\nLGUs were likewise tasked to conduct information campaigns regarding the virus as well as post public advisories and preventive measures the public can take.\nThe Department of Education (DepEd) continues to promote awareness regarding the virus in schools and immediate communities through information materials from DOH. The DepEd has also expanded the work of its Taal Quick Response and Recovery Team to include the nCoV-ARD matter.\nTransportation\nMeanwhile, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) and its attached agencies have implemented safety protocols as early as January 23. Andanar said the DOTr has been closely coordinating with the DOH and the Bureau of Quarantine (BoQ) to support in securing transport terminals and in monitoring arriving passengers.\nTo contain the spread of the 2019 nCoV-ARD, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) has reactivated its communicable disease preparedness procedures on all CAAP-operated airports, especially those with international flights.\nAirport frontline personnel were likewise advised to follow precautionary measures, to exercise extreme vigilance in handling passenger arrivals, and to strictly monitor those who may be infected by the virus.\nThe Civil Aviation Board (CAB) also resolved to immediately and indefinitely suspend all air services operations between Wuhan and any point in the Philippines.\nMeanwhile, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) has mandated all public utility vehicle (PUV) drivers and conductors to wear face masks at all times and have asked franchise holders to ensure compliance. Terminal operators were also directed to ensure proper sanitation and provide face masks and disinfectants or sanitizers for free, for passengers to use.\nThe Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA), on the other hand, advised ship owners and operators to take the necessary measures to monitor the 2019 nCoV-ARD and to report suspected cases. They were also asked to install necessary medical equipment and to equip their personnel with full information about the virus.\n\u201cThe MARINA has put in place monitoring procedures such as body temperature tests for people entering its building, wearing of masks for its frontline personnel, and the provision of alcohol dispensers at its entrances and comfort rooms. Its premises are also being regularly sanitized,\u201d Andanar said.\nKeep calm\nAndanar, however, sought the public\u2019s cooperation as the government undertakes measures to contain the spread of the virus.\n\u201cWe enjoin the public to be vigilant and conscientious, and to work with the authorities and follow their prescribed procedures and precautionary measures. Preventing the spread of the virus is a shared effort, which requires the cooperation of everyone,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe appeal to the public to remain calm, level-headed, and compassionate, as we all work towards dealing with and containing the threat of the 2019-nCoV spread,\u201d he added.",

There have been five cases in the U.S. and others confirmed in over a dozen other countries, according to USA Today.\nFor some Facebook users, the tone of the advertisement by The House on Hood bar in the North Island city of Hamilton, about 70 miles south of Auckland, jarred with the seriousness of the disease, which has put a number of cities in China into lockdown. Corona beers are lined up in Mexico City in this illustrative image. A bar in New Zealand has faced criticism for a promotion of the beer during the coronavirus epidemic.

These airlines include local carrier Air Macau, which canceled the majority of its flights bound for the mainland including those to Shanghai, Beijing, Daxing and Xiamen. Shenzhen Airlines also canceled its flight to Wuxi yesterday, while Chinese Eastern Airlines, Shanghai Airlines and Juneyao Airlines are cancelling their flights to Nanjing and Shanghai today. Shanghai Airlines\u2019 flights to Shanghai from tomorrow until February 2 are also canceled. The local carrier advised that passengers booked on the relevant flights may re-book or receive a refund for the tickets. Air Macau will waive the re-booking and refund fees. Flights to and from Wuhan and Macau have been suspended since January 23. Some affected passengers expressed complaints about the canceled flights, noting that they were not advised of the cancelation through their personal emails or phones. \u201cI only received my notification when I was back in Taiwan,\u201d an affected passenger, who requested to remain unnamed, told the Times. The passenger\u2019s flight was set to depart to Taipei yesterday morning. The passenger did not receive any notification from Air Macau, even the night before her flight. Air Macau announced the cancelation on WeChat and Facebook. Although the airline offered alternatives to affected passengers, the passenger said these were even more complicated. \u201cThe website [Air Macau provided] was working, but it kept telling me that my flight was unaffected,\u201d the passenger said. \u201cEven [when] I went straight to the airport, my problem wasn\u2019t solved.\u201d The airline\u2019s website shows no 24-hour hotline to handle such situations. The passenger was then required to return to the airport yesterday morning, on the original flight day, to fight for a seat on the next flight alongside about 100 other affected passengers. Local broadcaster TDM interviewed a Taiwanese tourist, who said she also received no notification about the cancelation from the local airline. A Times reader received an email yesterday from the new Taiwanese airline, Starlux, about a flight change taking place in March to Taipei. The cause for the change was not immediately made clear.",

A correspondingly large number of Chinese fly there, even during the Corona crisis. We asked Christoph Bonsmann, CEO of Action Medeor, (The emergency pharmacy of the world) vulnerable Africa is.\nChina is more present in Africa than any other country. Across the continent, China is involved in the operation of government buildings, railway lines, airports, but also barracks and refineries. For years, the volume of trade between the two sides has also been in the three-digit dollar range. In 2018, China's head of state Xi Jinping also announced that he intended to invest 60 billion dollars in Africa's economic development within three years. No wonder, then, that many Chinese travel to Africa for business reasons, even now, during the Corona crisis. We asked Christoph Bonsmann, CEO of Action Medeor, three questions about the situation:\nHow vulnerable is Africa in the Corona crisis?\nChristoph Bonsmann The problem is that one billion people live in Africa, but there are only two laboratories on the entire continent that are able to test samples for the coronavirus. In addition, the early warning systems that countries have developed in the past because of Ebola do not work with corona. Ebola was only transmissible if symptoms such as fever were detectable. However, there are many patients with corona who are ill but show no or hardly any symptoms. So it is very difficult to act quickly when cases occur. At the same time, this would be the only way to prevent a strong spread. You could say that Africa is our blind spot in the Corona crisis.\nSo Africa must be expecting a major breakout?\nBonsmann Not necessarily. But Africa is one of the most important trading partners for China. Accordingly, many Chinese travel there and stay in Africa. I've seen that myself on my recent travels. The airport in Addis Ababa, for example, is a major hub in Africa. But unlike many other airlines, Ethiopian Airlines has not stopped flying between China and Africa. The possibility that the virus could spread in Africa is therefore quite real.\nHow are the country offices of Action Medeor (The emergency pharmacy of the world) preparing for this?\nAccording to Bonsmann, you can't prepare properly. Protective suits are mostly sold out, face masks are useless. Washing your hands works best. We store alcohol-based disinfectants for that. They are easy to use, no matter where you are. Also, people affected must be isolated immediately and the contacts they had must be traced.",

Then again the bittersweet divorce between Great Britain and Europe has shown that despite a big part of the population being partial to a quick reunion the majority still counts and the results are always more or less uncertain. So with talks between the Catalan and Spanish government coming up as well as new election due in Catalonia soon, this is a very interesting issue.\nThe other headline of the week, the fast spreading deadly corona-virus originating from China, has been the other topic of the street even here in Spain, where no actual cases of infections have yet been reported. At the moment it seems like some alarmed parts of the population have so far mostly managed to block many emergency rooms, and the authorities are trying to calm things down and keep the panic away.

Over 50% of the patients suffered from chronic diseases including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (40 patients) and diabetes (12 patients). Epidemiological pattern\nClose to half of the patients initially affected had a history of direct exposure at the Huanan seafood market where the infection is thought to have originated. Of the 49 patients with direct exposure, 46 patients worked as managers or salespeople, thus exposing them to the virus over a longer period of time as compared to the shorter exposure of the two patients who were shopping at the market. Signs & symptoms of coronavirus infection\nThe most common symptoms described by the patients were fever (82 patients) and cough (81 patients). A third of the patients (31) experienced shortness of breath. Other symptoms experienced by around 5 to 11% of the patients included muscle ache, confusion, headache, and sore throat. Clinical findings in patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus All the patients had pneumonia. The majority of the patients (75%) were infected in both lungs. Many patients (17%) presented with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. About 8% of patients suffered from acute respiratory injury. About 3% of the patients suffered from kidney damage; 4% of the patients suffered from septic shock, and one patient suffered from ventilator-associated pneumonia. Five critically ill patients also showed coinfections with bacteria (1 patient) and fungi (4 patients). Treatment and prognosis\nAll of the patients were treated in quarantine. The majority of the patients were treated with antivirals, for three to fourteen days. About 25 to 45% of the patients were treated with antibiotics for three to seventeen days. Most patients also received oxygen therapy. While most of the patients responded well to the treatment, with over thirty patients discharged by January 25th 2020, over half of the patients are still in the hospital. Seventeen patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and 11 of these patients died.\nThis study was the largest of its kind studying patients infected with 2019-nCoV, and provides critical information regarding the characteristics of this virus infection. As the numbers of infected patients keep increasing, additional information from larger studies is needed to help understand this infection and contain the spread.",

At least 81 people have died since the new strain of coronavirus emerged in China\u2019s Wuhan, and millions are now under an effective quarantine, with all flights in and out of the city postponed. There is also a ban on Chinese tour groups domestically and abroad. The measures come in the middle of a boom in Chinese foreign travel, with the number of tourists from the country going up almost tenfold since 2003. Businesses in destinations depending on the huge numbers of Chinese tourists are already feeling the heat, with \u201cdeserted\u201d beaches and shops, and concerns about the future. The outbreak is akin to the SARS crisis, which paralyzed regional travel and battered local economies from late 2002. At that time, Chinese tourist numbers declined by around a third. In Japan, the drop in Chinese visitors has already been felt in Asakusa, a popular tourist destination near the Sensoji temple. It will now be \u201cvery difficult\u201d for Japan to achieve its target of 40 million tourists in 2020, said Yuki Takashima, an economist at Nomura Securities. The effects will be felt beyond hotels, restaurants and tourist sites since many Chinese tourists visit Japan specifically for shopping purposes. However, Japan would still be better placed to weather the storm compared to another top destination for Chinese tourists, i.e. Thailand. Tourism accounts for 18 percent of Thailand\u2019s GDP, with Chinese holidaymakers making up more than a quarter of total arrivals.

Most coronaviruses are not dangerous.Some types of them are serious, though. About 858 people have died from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which first appeared in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and then in other countries in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Europe. In April 2014, the first American was hospitalized for MERS in Indiana and another case was reported in Florida. Both had just returned from Saudi Arabia. In May 2015, there was an outbreak of MERS in Korea, which was the largest outbreak outside of the Arabian Peninsula. In 2003, 774 people died from a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. As of 2015, there were no further reports of cases of SARS. MERS and SARS are types of coronaviruses.But in early January 2020, the World Health Organization identified a new type: 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China. By late January, there were 300 confirmed cases in China and a death count that was still in the single digits, but rising. And despite airport screenings, a traveler had brought the first case to the U.S.What Is a Coronavirus?Coronaviruses were first identified in the 1960s, but we don't know where they come from. They get their name from their crown-like shape. Sometimes, but not often, a coronavirus can infect both animals and humans.Most coronaviruses spread the same way other cold-causing viruses do: through infected people coughing and sneezing, by touching an infected person's hands or face, or by touching things such as doorknobs that infected people have touched.Almost everyone gets a coronavirus infection at least once in their life, most likely as a young child. In the United States, coronaviruses are more common in the fall and winter, but anyone can come down with a coronavirus infection at any time. ",

        "content": "Coronavirus is a common term for a group of viruses usually found in animals but causes severe disorders in humans when gets transmitted. The transfer of viruses from animals to humans is called zoonosis and coronavirus is one among them. Many coronaviruses reside in animals and cause them no harm, however, sometimes they get mutated into deadly strains. When these deadly mutated forms of coronavirus come in contact with humans, they affect them with mild to severe symptoms that range from the common cold to severe respiratory tract disorder and pneumonia.\nYou may have several questions regarding the novel coronavirus. Here is the list of all the questions and answers related to the outbreak of the Chinese virus. 1. What is a Novel Coronavirus?\nThe term 'Novel Coronavirus' or new coronavirus is given to an undetectable strain of coronavirus which was found recently in Wuhan (China). As this virus has not been identified yet, it was named as COVID-19. 2. What is SARS-CoV?\nThe term SARS-CoV means Severe Acute respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. It is referred to as a deadly and contagious disease that has caused an epidemic in 2002 in China and worldwide. The coronavirus responsible for SARS is known to have spread from bats and civets. 3. How similar is COVID-19 to SARS-CoV?\nCOVID-19 is not the same virus responsible for the spread SARS-CoV in 2002. However, it belongs to the same family of viruses as SARS. 4. How dangerous is novel coronavirus?\nNovel coronavirus can cause mild to severe symptoms in people who are infected with the virus. Mild symptoms of coronavirus are usually flu-like, which include runny nose, cough, sore throat and fever. When the symptoms become severe, it may lead to breathing difficulties, pneumonia or death of a person. 5. Who is more prone to coronavirus infection?\nPeople with a compromised immune system or pre-existing medical conditions like diabetes or respiratory disorders are more prone to getting affected by the deadly coronavirus. 6. Is it true that the COVID-19 got transmitted to humans from an animal source?\nThe past report says that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were transmitted to humans from an animals source. SARS-CoV became epidemic in 2002 and was transmitted from bats and civet cats to humans. On the other hand, MERS-CoV was transmitted to humans from Arabian camels.\nAs for COVID-19, researchers believe that the virus has spread most likely from the seafood animal market in China after diagnosing the first case of human coronavirus. However, it does not mean that you can get infected by a coronavirus from your pet or any animal. As the previous cases of coronavirus were from an animal source and COVID-19 is also believed to have spread from an animal, it is advised to prevent any direct contact with live animals in the seafood market or surfaces in contact with those animals until the exact animal source is identified.\nIt is also advised to prevent the consumption of raw or undercooked animal products and to handle their organs, meat and milk with care to prevent cross-contamination of these raw items to other foods. 7. Is the novel coronavirus contagious?\nYes, the novel coronavirus is contagious from person to person. The reason is that the virus mainly affects the respiratory system of a person and first cause common cold symptoms like sneezing and coughing. When a person sneezes or coughs without any mask, the infected respiratory droplets come out and spread to people who are in close contact with this person or touches infected objects. The infected respiratory droplets can be a nose discharge, sneeze, cough or saliva. 8. Can I get COVID-19 from my pets?\nAccording to researchers, until now there is no evidence that the coronavirus might have transmitted from pets like cats and dogs, or such animals have been infected with the COVID-19. 9. Who are at major risk of coronavirus infection?\nPeople who are living or travelling to China since the outbreak is at higher risk of getting the infection. Apart from this, people who are in close contact with travellers from China like their family members or colleagues and medical professionals who are taking care of the coronavirus infected person are vulnerable to coronavirus infection. 10. Can wearing a mask protect us from coronavirus?\nWearing a mask is suggested by WHO to limit the spread of the disease. Though it is effective to some limit, it does not guarantee to completely prevent the spread until other preventive measures are taken. However, wearing a mask will prevent you from coughing or sneezing in the open and also prevent you from the infected fluids of others from entering your nose or mouth. 11. What happens if a coronavirus infected person sneezes or coughs without any mask?\nWhen an infected person sneezes or coughs without a mask, the infected respiratory droplets come out and sit on objects or surfaces. When a second person touches those surfaces unknowingly and then touches their mouth or nose, the virus finds a way to the respiratory system of that person and infect them. Next time when the second person sneezes without a mask, the virus comes out and infect a third person. In this way, it gets transmitted from person to person. 12. How long can the virus survive on surfaces?\nThe exact time of the survival of coronavirus on surfaces is still unknown. However, some information suggests that they may survive for a few hours on surfaces. Cleaning the infected surfaces with a simple disinfectant may kill all the viruses and can no longer infect any person. 13. How to identify the difference between flu and COVID-19 symptoms?\nThe symptoms of both flu and COVID-19 include runny nose, fever, cough and sneezing which makes diagnosing very difficult between the two. However, certain lab tests help identify the presence of coronavirus in the body and confirm the case. 14. What is the incubation period of coronavirus?\nIncubation period refers to the time between getting infected by a virus and the appearance of the symptoms. The incubation period of COVID-19 is 14 days as per the medical experts. An infected person can also transmit the infection before the appearance of the symptoms. However, the majority of the virus is spread after the development of the symptoms. 15. Can I get infected if I receive a package from China or other infected countries?\nNo, receiving a package from the infected countries is unlikely to get you infected. The virus can't survive on objects or surfaces for a long time. 16. Why antibiotics are not suggested to treat the symptoms of coronavirus?\nAntibiotics are antibacterial drugs which are used mainly to treat an infection caused due to bacteria, not viruses. As coronavirus infection is caused by viruses, antibiotic drugs are not suggested to treat the symptoms. 17. What type of medicines can treat or prevent COVID-19?\nUntil now, no such medicines have been developed to completely treat the infection caused due to novel coronavirus. However, there are certain medicines which are used to treat its symptoms. The best way to prevent COVID-19 is by maintaining personal hygiene.\nAccording to a recent report, a patient in Thailand infected by novel coronavirus was recovered within 48 hours after receiving a cocktail of two approved anti-HIV drugs (lopinavir and ritonavir) along with a flu drug named oseltamivir. 18. When is lab testing for COVID-19 carried out?\nIf a person experiences flu-like symptoms and has been living in the infected area, had close contact with people visiting from the infected countries or has been among people involved in taking care of infected ones are advised to get tested for COVID-19. 19. What are the preventive measures for coronavirus?\nMaintaining personal hygiene is a must to prevent coronavirus spread. Such preventive measures are as follows: Wash hands with alcoholic soaps and water. Avoid direct contact with sick people Stay at home if you are diagnosed with COVID-19. Avoid the spread of viruses by avoiding close contacts with your family members or other humans. Also, cover the mouth every time before coughing or sneezing. Avoid touching mouth, eyes or nose with dirty hands. Use disinfectants to clean the area around you. 20. What happens to patients after they are detected with COVID-19?\nPatients who are detected with COVID-19 are kept in the isolation ward in hospitals and the healthcare workers who are involved in taking care of those patients are advised to wear protective gears like mask and gloves while treating those patients. 21. Can a person get coronavirus if they have flu symptoms but not visited any affected countries or came in contact with infected ones?\nThe answer is no. People who are suffering from flu but have not visited any infected country or place or came in contact with an infected person are less likely to get infected by the novel coronavirus. According to reports, several travellers travelled from China to their countries had flu-like symptoms. However, when their lab tests were carried out, the results were negative.",

Pneumonia can be contagious and can be transmitted from human to human. The influenza virus, or the flu, is a common cause of viral pneumonia. Advice\nPotentially impacted travelers are advised to monitor the situation, confirm travel itineraries and consider rebooking options, if needed, and adhere to all instructions issued by local authorities and their home governments. Individuals are advised to take precautionary measures to reduce their risk of contracting the virus: Avoid all contact with animals (dead or alive); avoid eating animal products that are undercooked; avoid all markets where animals are sold Avoid all close contact with people displaying symptoms of the disease (e.g. difficulties breathing) Frequently wash hands, wear a face mask Individuals within China developing symptoms of pneumonia are advised to seek medical attention, avoid contact with other people, and wash hands regularly Adhere to all instructions issued by local authorities and their home governments Travelers returning from China developing symptoms of pneumonia are advised to call emergency services before going to the doctor or hospital to avoid spreading the disease.",

        "content": "Dr. Marc Wathelet commented that he was puzzled about my report of a spike protein gene homologous to part of the pShuttle-SN vector, given that spike glycoproteins are found in bat coronavirus. He urged me to analyze the homology (sequence similarity) of the SARS-like spike protein element I reported with other spike proteins, saying that any scientist working on coronviruses would be surprised if there were not a spike protein.\nI replied in comment that I, too, would expect protein sequence level homology due to shared conserved domains, but assured him that I would undertake further genome sequence-level (nucleotide) analysis as the location of the novel sequence relative to the other spike proteins is certainly of interest.\nA few recent publications (sent to me by followers/readers) contained further bat coronavirus accession numbers, and SARS accession numbers, so I procured the spike protein coding sequence (CDS) of these from NCBI\u2019s nucleotide database and aligned them using Blast, with the sequence from the first 2019-nCoV protein as the anchor. (Oddly, that Genbank entry does not label the S protein CDS as a spike glycoprotein, instead annotating it only as a \u201cstructural protein\u201d).\nThe resulting massive alignment confirms a major unique inserted element in 2019-nCoV not found in other bat coronaviruses, nor in SARS in the homologous genomic position:\nThis is why full genome phylogenetic trees cannot tell the full story of recombinant viral evolution.\nBlasting the novel sequence region against all non-viral sequences (to pick up vector technology) again results in pShuttle-SN (no surprise) but now this time is also picked up a recombinant coronavirus clone Bat-SRBD spike glycoprotein gene from UNC, USA. ( Genbank entry ) and other synthetic constructs.\nAs I published earlier, before anyone points fingers at the Chinese, note that recombinant viruses have been in play in laboratories all across the world in many nations.\nThe overlap occur at the 3\u2032 end of the novel region (search restricted from 21600-22350 bp in the query 2019-nCoV sequence originally blasted against the other coronavirus CDS. It could arguably merely be that I selected too large a region; I chose the region visually to include the fully potentially inserted sequence including any homologous vector elements at the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end.\nIt is worth pointing out that due to the length of overlap, the sequence strength is considered moderately strong: highly significant E-value, high %identity, but short sequence length. These findings cannot be considered strong validation for obvious reasons: produced by the same analyst, using (part) of the same data. Spike proteins determine receptor binding for entry into cells, and 2019-nCoV appears to, like some bat species SARS coronavirus, target ACE2 receptors [1].\nFor those tracking closely, I confirmed that the novel inserted sequence in the large alignment above is the same as the novel sequence I reported a few days ago.",

        "content": "The biggest threat to our collective humanity today is not the suspected threat of a Third World War, but a corrosive, debilitating, murderous pathogen known as new Corona Virus. The fear of a World War III was fuelled by tensions and differences among key super powers dictating contemporary geo-politics notably: the US, China, Iran, Iraq, Israel, North Korea, South Korea and the entire Middle East. But while relationships with the world\u2019s power axis will always have implications for global peace, security and stability, the biggest and the most urgent threat by far is the outbreak of a new strain of the Corona Virus, in Wuhan, China which has within a short space of one month shown the vulnerability of man, the conflict between man and biology, and the limitations of science in the face of an immediate, accidental, unforeseeable, pathogenic onslaught.\nThe first case of Corona Virus was reported just before the Chinese Lunar New Year 2020 celebrations, and since then, the new virus has defied both man and science. On January 28, the highest number of reported cases was reported, but by Monday, February 10, that had jumped exponentially to 97 casualties per day and total cases in excess of 40, 000, with 908 persons reported dead. The statistics and the sero-prevalence rate seem unprecedented, far worse than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome of 2003 which claimed 774 lives. The World Health Organization has classified the new Corona Virus as a public health emergency of international concern, a delicate, diplomatic phrasing which barely stops short of declaring the nCoV-2019, as it is otherwise known, a global pandemic \u2013 considering the fact that mainland China, especially Wuhan, a city of 11 million people and the Hubei province in general, remain the epicenter \u2013 99% of reported cases are in mainland China and out of the total number of deaths, only two have occurred outside China.\nThe Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) has commended China for its efforts at prevention and containment, even if the Politburo, the highest political body in China has had to express regrets for \u201cfailing\u201d the people. The truth is: China is overwhelmed. Businesses have been affected, the stock market is down, lives are threatened, over 40 million people are in quarantine. China is engaging the world as the epicenter of a crisis, the global economy is likely to be affected given China\u2019s strategic importance, and yet nobody knows when the Corona virus will ease off, or when scientists will find a cure. It is not only China that is at risk, it is the entire world. Our civilization is under threat and of course, the tragedy is man-made. These are the cold, uncomfortable facts as at the time of this writing. The Corona Virus has brought the entire world to the precipice of uncertainty and disaster. It reminds us collectively of our mortality and the common humanity and vulnerability that we share.\nGlobalization turned the world into a small village, technology erased distances, but in the face of a global scourge like new Corona Virus, the world has turned into a much smaller village. Most of the people and countries that are taking precautions against Corona Virus don\u2019t even know where Wuhan is on the map. Some people ate snake meat or is it Pangolin or bat meat in Wuhan and they got infected with a virus \u2013 animal to man transmission, which has now spread to over 27 countries and mutated as a deadly human-to-human communicable disease. China which is ordinarily regarded as a major superpower has suddenly become a pariah nation. Countries have issued travel alerts to their citizens: do not go to China, and those who are in China are being evacuated and whoever arrives from China is immediately quarantined for two weeks.\nThis is the same China that only recently engaged the United States in a trade war. The same China is now the diseased nation that nobody wants to touch. Imports from China have been suspended. Trips to China have been put on hold. China\u2019s tourism industry is bound to suffer. Who wants to go to a country where a virus is on rampage, and the air is polluted? It is not for nothing that the media in Europe has dubbed the Corona Virus, the China Virus \u2013 an average Chinese citizen would not like that \u2013 but the truth is that the new Corona Virus wears the toga of a nationality. Before it, there was the Swine flu (2009), Polio (2014), Zika (2016), Ebola (2014, 2019) but it is the new Corona Virus that has obtained a national passport and an identification tag of notorious universal recognition. This may have translated into racist conclusions about Chinese identity and cuisine. I have heard allegations that the Chinese eat anything and everything, including animals that are considered a taboo in many cultures \u2013 Bats? Cockroaches? Rats? Snakes? Millipedes and centipedes? Monkeys? Pangolin? E-eeish! It is said that the Chinese have brought this latest biological dissonance upon humanity because of their unusual culinary taste. I know people who have simply opted to stay away from anything Chinese in the meantime, until there is some certainty about what exactly is going on. I wanted to order food from a Chinese Restaurant the other day. I was quietly reminded of Corona Virus. I had no option but to restrain my palate. I wanted Chinese balm, a popular product in Nigeria, a few days later. I was also advised to be careful. I ignored that advice. The labelling of everything Chinese as an item crowned by a virus is exaggerated and overblown. But as Nigerians would say in pidgin English: who wan die?\nThis is probably why every country and institution is taking precautions. The United Kingdom, Australia, South Korea, Singapore and New Zealand have had cause to evacuate their citizens from China. Airlines including FinnAir, American Airlines, United, Cathay Pacific, Air India, Ethiopian Airlines, British Airways, Air Asia, and Lufthansa have either stopped flights to China or reduced their Chinese operations by 90%. The effect is that supply chains have been disrupted with consequences for trade performance. The global economy is bound to slow down in the long run if this situation persists. But what is perhaps more relevant to us should be this: How prepared is Africa and particularly Nigeria? I don\u2019t think Africa is prepared at all, and we are likely to be worst hit should the virus make an effective landing in our continent.\nFor now across Africa, we have only heard of suspected cases: in Ghana where there were two suspected cases involving a Chinese and an Argentine who returned from China, but the result was negative in both cases. Suspected cases in Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Kenya and Botswana have also proven negative. The only reported case of infection involving an African is that of a Cameroonian student living in Wuhan. Kenya has taken steps to evacuate its students in China. Mozambique has suspended its visa on arrival policy. Africa and South America seem insulated from the scourge so far. But for how much longer? The Chinese Lunar New Year Holiday was extended, in the face of the outbreak of the virus, but that holiday ended yesterday, Monday, February 10. Using that as guide, if there was any Chinese living in Africa or doing business in Africa, he or she is likely to return to base after the holiday. In the last decade or more, Sino-African relationship has grown tremendously, China seeking to fill a vacuum inadvertently created by the EU and the United States, has increased its scope of influence in Africa through friendly loans, investments and cultural outreach. It is not an accident that African leaders at the just concluded 33rd AU Heads of State Summit in Addis Ababa expressed solidarity with China! The Chinese presence in Africa is unmistakable and it is quite pronounced in a country like Nigeria where the Chinese are involved in significant sectors of the economy including oil and gas, telecommunications, manufacturing, infrastructure, SMEs and retail trade. This week, all the Chinese who went home on holiday will start returning one after the other.\nWhen the story of the Corona Virus broke, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) was most unusually proactive, which I think is commendable. The Federal Ministry of Health quickly followed suit, to educate Nigerians about the threat of the Corona Virus. Preventive guidelines were announced, and a travel advisory was issued. This is indeed commendable, even if the efforts were not translated into local, indigenous languages, that is \u2013 the languages of the majority of Nigerians. The campaign has thus far been so elitist and restricted. In due course, the Nigerian authorities further announced that the Federal Government had established eight isolation centres as follows: in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and seven states of the Federation \u2013 Lagos, Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Enugu, Delta, Cross River and Kano. The problem is that nobody knows exactly where these isolation centres are located.\nThe relevant authorities tell us that in preparing for the Corona Virus which has not yet been reported in Nigeria, they are relying on the protocols and infrastructure already put in place in 2014 to combat the Ebola Virus. In 2014, Nigeria was confronted with the Ebola Virus crisis, introduced to the country by a traveler from Liberia who came to Nigeria to seek spiritual cure for Ebola. Knowledge and experience can definitely prove useful in everything including a biological and pharmaceutical crisis such as Corona Virus. But has Nigeria done enough or is Nigeria prepared? I don\u2019t think so. There is definitely no evidence that we have enough medical counter-measures to protect the medical and public health personnel who are supposed to man our ports. A gentleman who just returned from Chicago reported on live television and I have no cause to doubt him, that the situation at the Murtala Muhammad International Airport in Lagos, to cite a specific example, is chaotic and below standard practice. Government officials pretend to check for high temperature and other symptoms but they are not protected. Nigeria has not made any provision for medical counter measures. Nigeria is sending medical personnel and Ministry officials to the ports to put them at risk. Until we have another case of Stella Adadevoh, like Li Weliang, the Chinese whistleblower who paid the supreme price for Corona Virus, the Nigerian government is not likely to wake up. That is unacceptable.\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and the Federal Ministry of Health and state governments have to do a lot more. I will comment on the latter. As at this moment, only three states \u2013 Lagos, Ebonyi and Ogun out of the 36 states of the Federation would seem to have shown interest in the Corona Virus prevention campaign. We expect every state of the Federation, close as they are to the grassroots, to take up the campaign and inform the populace appropriately. At the national level, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and the Federal Ministry of Health will also need to address what has become around the subject of Corona Virus, an \u201cinfodemic crisis\u201d \u2013 that is the crisis of conspiracy theories and misinformation and hazardous false information. Is the Corona Virus a biological weapon?. Really? Is it a strategy by big pharmaceutical companies to enlarge market and increase profit? President Donald Trump and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have also been linked to the conspiracy. Does that make sense? We have also been told that eating garlic or drinking a bleach concoction can help prevent a Corona Virus infection. Is that true? The Nigerian agencies are yet to respond to this. They should. They should take the additional step of addressing the spiritual question which determines everything in Nigeria from politics to business. Is Corona Virus a spiritual affliction or biology gone awry? If care is not taken, Nigerian shamanists, prophets, traditionalists and pastors will soon take advantage of the uncertainty to claim that they had predicted the occurrence of the virus and that, indeed they have the solution. Government should immediately arrest anyone who mouths such idiocy. Our only hope is that the Corona Virus will never make its way here, but as the Boys Scouts motto states, we should \u201cBe Prepared\u201d. The bad news is that there is no effective treatment for the virus. And a worse virus may soon show up, leaving humanity effectively at the mercy of disease and the environment.\nII: Asisat Oshoala, the Super Star When Asisat Oshoala, the Super Falcons and Barcelona Ferminino striker was declared winner of the African Women\u2019s Footballer of the Year, 2019, a few weeks ago, the big concern was that her own compatriots who sat on the Confederation of Africa Football judges panel refused to vote for her. Every single one of them voted for an outsider. They didn\u2019t consider their own compatriot good enough. I have addressed this matter at length in a piece titled \u201cThe Betrayal of Asisat Oshoala,\u201d (This Day, back page, January 14).\nAt the time, Ms. Oshoala lost her cool momentarily and tried to engage her critics which was absolutely unnecessary. But the best response that she has offered, and the one that is relevant, is how, after returning to her club in Europe, she has been putting up such sterling performance that further confirms her status as a super star on the pitch.\nIn January, she won the Africa Football Women\u2019s Player of the year to equal the record of fellow Nigerian Perpetua Nkwocha. With her current performance, Oshoala does not want to just equal existing record, she wants to break the record in African Women\u2019s Football. After winning the CAF award in January she reportedly said: \u201c\u2026I want to create my own history and not just equal someone else\u2019s record \u2013 I\u2019m going to give my best to create mine.\u201d She is doing just that right now. Five-time winner of the Women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations, best player at the 2014 FIFA U-20 Women\u2019s World Cup, winner of the BBC Footballer of the Year, 2015, Chinese Women\u2019s Super League Top Scorer, 2017, she scored a brace in Barcelona\u2019s 10\u20131 trouncing and humiliation of Real Sociedad in the Spanish Women\u2019s League Super Cup Final on February 9, 2020. Loaned to Barcelona from China in January 2019, and later offered a permanent transfer, Asisat Oshoala has been a formidable and result-oriented member of the Barca line up and one of its most valuable players.\nOn January 11, 2020, four days after the CAF awards, Oshoala scored four goals in a 6-0 win against CD Tacon. She has been consistent since then. Whoever has any doubt about her achievements and quality may end up voting for her someday soon. Congratulations Asisat. Keep shooting. Keep shining.\n",

Clean hands should be dried thoroughly with a clean towel or air dryer.\nFiction: Cold weather, hot weather, snow, eating garlic or taking a hot bath have also been suggested as ways people can prevent themselves from becoming infected.\nFact: There is no evidence behind these claims and no evidence as yet to suggest that COVID-19 will be affected by weather or the seasons.\nThe best way to protect yourself is by washing your hands frequently and avoiding contact with anyone who might be infected. This way, you can eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that might occur by touching your eyes, mouth and nose.",

However the health ministry has confirmed the man does not have the virus.\nThe disease has already led to 41 deaths in China, the lockdown of several cities and the complete closure of the city of Wuhan, the place where the virus first made its appearance.\nA warning about the disease and its symptoms has been issued to doctors in Belgium as the cases approach closer to Belgium\u2019s borders. Three cases have been confirmed in France, two in Paris and one in Bordeaux.\nThe symptoms are described as shortness of breath, cough and fever \u2013 symptoms common to many different causes. The man suspected of being infected with the virus, however, had recently returned from China, thus adding to suspicion. But when blood samples were taken and tested at the university hospital in Leuven, it was found that the Corona virus was not present.\nThe St-Pierre hospital has been named by the federal ministry of health as the reference centre for any apparent appearance of the disease.

Blood tests are to be carried out at Leuven. Anyone who has been in contact with the subject is to be inspected medically. They will not be placed in isolation, but will continue to be inspected twice daily. If they develop symptoms, they will then come under the isolation protocol for the original patient.\nThe Belgian foreign affairs ministry is aware of 11 of their nationals present in China in the area affected by the outbreak. All have been contacted by email.\n\u201c We are following the situation, and have advised our people to be careful, to avoid animal markets, animals living and dead, the consumption of raw meat and contact with sick people,\u201d a ministry spokesperson told Le Vif . \u201cThey are also advised to observe proper hygiene rules, and to consult a doctor if the slightest symptom shows itself. The situation is changing rapidly, so we advise everyone travelling to China to follow the instructions of local authorities and the World Health Organisation.\u201d\nFor anyone travelling to China, the foreign affairs ministry has advised that any trip to Hubei province, where Wuhan is situated, is not recommended.

        "content": "As the number of people infected with the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV increases each day, scientists around the world are racing to find a treatment. Since the virus as first reported from Wuhan, China, at the end of December, and the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern on Jan. 30, commitments to fund research and development efforts are being made by governments , research institutes , partnerships and companies .\nAs the clock ticks, we should take a moment to realize we are witnessing something quite remarkable: The impressive speed with which science about 2019-nCoV is being shared.\nFrom the day of the outbreak\u2019s first report, it took little more than one week for the World Health Organization to confirm the existence of the new coronavirus and for Chinese scientists to publish its genetic sequence . Think back to 2003 when it took more than two months for the sequence of the coronavirus that causes SARS to be shared with the world.\nThe speed with which the sequence of 2019-nCoV has been shared is a potent reminder of how we should avoid tying up the research community in red tape when we are in a race to find a new vaccine or treatment for a new virus or other pathogen.\nBut that is precisely what a legally binding international agreement, the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing , has inadvertently ended up doing. This supplementary international agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity could make it extraordinarily difficult to conduct disease surveillance or forge research collaborations around the world.\nThe Nagoya Protocol has the laudable aim of giving each country sovereignty over its biological resources. But this could hinder, or even prevent, the global collaboration required to find new treatments or vaccines. Today, more and more countries are moving towards enacting the Nagoya Protocol in national legislation, interpreting it in a way that requires sharing of pathogen samples and their information to be subject to negotiation between two parties.\nHad China followed Nagoya Protocol requirements following the discovery of 2019-nCov, it could have embarked on discussions with each country, one by one, about how to share the sequence of this pathogen. That runs counter to WHO guidance on managing ethical issues in outbreaks: \u201cRapid data sharing is critical during an unfolding health emergency. The ethically appropriate and rapid sharing of data can help identify etiological factors, predict disease spread, evaluate existing and novel treatments, symptomatic care and preventive measures, and guide the deployment of limited resources.\u201d\nAs The Lancet put it in a Jan. 24 editorial on the novel coronavirus that I firmly endorse, \u201cOpenness and sharing of data are paramount. There are enormous demands for rapid access to information about this new virus, the patients and communities affected, and the response. But equally crucial is the need to ensure that those data are reliable, accurate, and independently scrutinized.\u201d\nThe inclusion of pathogens (as a genetic resource) under the Nagoya Protocol was not directly addressed in the final text of the protocol. It was left to each party to \u201cpay due regard\u201d to potential public health risks when implementing legislation.\nThis has led to increasing confusion and lack of alignment on implementing the Nagoya Protocol. Some countries do not include pathogens in the protocol. Others do, which has led to delays and disruption in the comprehensive sharing of samples of seasonal influenza and related genetic sequence information. Sharing such information is key to enabling researchers and manufacturers to identify and produce the necessary diagnostics, vaccines, and other treatments that contribute to a rapid response to epidemics and pandemics.\nIn other words, the potential of the Nagoya Protocol for adverse impacts on infectious disease prevention, timely epidemic response and, ultimately, global health security, is quite significant.\nAs the director general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, a research-based biopharmaceutical industry body with official relations with the United Nations, I support the Convention on Biological Diversity, which has three laudable objectives: conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components, and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources. But protecting the biodiversity of pathogens seems a perversion of the original aims of the convention.\nPathogens know no borders, so any obstacle to sharing them and/or their associated information will hinder essential global collaborations with the private and public sectors needed to develop effective countermeasures to disease outbreaks.\nThe GISAID Initiative aims to promote the international sharing of human and animal virus data. It has played a critical role in centralizing the collection of coronavirus sequences so they can be quickly and comprehensively shared with the international community \u2014 thanks to the credibility the initiative has gained in more than a dozen years of sharing the sequences of influenza viruses. In so doing it has won the trust and confidence that all parties are working together to share sequences fairly and follow the scientific etiquette of acknowledging the source of the data.\nI believe it is in the world\u2019s best interests to promote trust and fairness for the sake of global public health by making the sharing of pathogens and associated information swift and predictable.\nIt is time to question the sense of retaining pathogens within the scope of the Nagoya Protocol and associated national legislation. It is surely in the overriding interest of global public health and epidemic and pandemic preparedness for the international community to work towards an effective and internationally coherent approach to exempt pathogens from the protocol.\nThomas B. Cueni is Director-General of The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA)",

At present, it is in a tense period of national epidemic prevention and control. In order to respond to the needs of epidemic prevention and control, Antwork actively contacts with local hospitals, supports epidemic prevention with practical actions, fully cooperates with local governments and medical related units, and escorts the timely and rapid delivery of medical samples and protection materials through the deployment of it\u2019s drone transportation network. During the epidemic prevention and control period, Antwork took the initiative to take drone RA3 and tr7s as well as unmanned station RH1 as the technical solution, to do the transportation of medical samples and quarantine materials between Xinchang County People\u2019s Hospital, Xinchang County disease control center and Dashiju branch of Xinchang County People\u2019s hospital. In this operation, the air delivery system provided by Antwork is adopted. Its automatic and unmanned operation mode can significantly reduce the contact opportunities between samples and personnel in the transportation process, and improve the delivery speed. At the same time, the Antwork branch company (Aerodeli), which undertakes this operation task, has obtained the world\u2019s first urban drone delivery \u201clicense\u201d issued by Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) last October. The sample delivery work will be carried out in strict accordance with the certified operation procedures, which can ensure the safety of medical samples in the transportation process. Take off and landing point of disease control center of Xinchang County\nIn the actual transportation process, the flight efficiency of drone has increased by more than 50% compared with the ordinary road transportation, which provides an efficient means of transportation for the epidemic prevention and control. At the same time, with more and more medical staff and ambulance being transferred to the front line, in the case of extreme personnel shortage, the use of drone transportation can also save human and material resources to the greatest extent. In addition, using drone to transport materials can effectively avoid secondary pollution of medical materials.As soon as the news of Wuhan blocking came out on January 23, Antwork immediately contacted the health and disease control departments of various regions, and took the initiative to petition for the technical support of drone air transportation for the front-line medical institutions fighting against the epidemic. After the project of Xinchang people\u2019s hospital is put into operation, Antwork will also actively assist more medical institutions around the nation to deploy air transport services and contribute a technical force to the anti-epidemic!",

The evacuation plans come as Chinese President Xi Jinping warned on Saturday that situation had become \u201cgrave\u201d given the \u201caccelerating spread\u201d of the virus across the country, which has now put as many as 18 cities on lockdown \u2013 including Wuhan where policemen were seen turning cars back from city borders. The increase in the number of fatalities \u2013 from 26 on Friday to 41 \u2013 was the sharpest single-day spike in deaths due to the previously unseen virus that is believed to have begun spreading late December from a seafood market in Wuhan. Around 250 Indians are still in Wuhan, people aware of the situation said, adding that hundreds more are believed to have headed back to India in the past two weeks for the Lunar New Year holidays. The remaining Indians in the city mostly comprise students and around 50 working individuals, these people added. India has requested the Chinese foreign ministry as well as local officials in Wuhan to consider making arrangements for Indians to leave, news agency PTI quoted sources as saying. It is not clear how and when India plans to evacuate its citizens if approval is granted. The United States was reported to have begun arranging for a charter flight, a Boeing 767 jet that can carry around 230 passengers, to bring its citizens and diplomats back from Wuhan on Sunday, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Washington was given approval for the operation from the Chinese foreign ministry, the report added. Russia too was consulting with China while France was setting up a bus service to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan, according to media reports quoting the Russian embassy and the French consulate. In India, a top adviser of the Prime Minister met senior bureaucrats from across several ministries to review response mechanisms if the contagion spreads to India, while authorities also issued a fresh travel advisory urging people to avoid going to China unless essential. There are at least 11 people who have been isolated with symptoms similar to an nCoV infection \u2013 with dozens more being monitored over phone after they travelled to Chinese cities. The virus also expanded its footprint as Australia confirmed its first four cases on Saturday. Late on Friday, Malaysia confirmed three and France reported Europe\u2019s first infection. Hong Kong also declared an emergency, scrapping celebrations and restricting links to mainland China. Apart from these, positive cases of coronavirus have been reported from South Korea, Thailand, Nepal, Macau, Hong Kong, Singapore and as far as the US. Authorities in Wuhan said they will build a second hospital dedicated to coronavirus patients, a day after construction began for a 1,000-bed facility scheduled to be completed within ten days. About 450 military medics have also been deployed to help treat patients in the central city. Regions far from the epidemic epicentre, such as Beijing, have also started to clamp down on the flow of people. On Saturday, the country\u2019s capital said it would suspend buses in and out of the city, on top of closing tourist attractions and cancelling large-scale events during the Lunar New Year holiday. \u201cAs long as we have steadfast confidence, work together, scientific prevention and cures, and precise policies, we will definitely be able to win the battle,\u201d Chinese President Xi told a meeting of the elite Politburo Standing Committee on Saturday. The virus has caused global alarm because of its similarity to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).The newly identified strain still has many unknowns surrounding it, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases, and shows flu-like symptoms. Particularly at risk are people who are either very young or old and those with a compromised immunity due to other diseases. ",

When there are fever, cough, and other symptoms, do you have to go to the hospital?\nPart I Pathogen Characteristics\n1. What are coronaviruses?\nCoronavirus is a kind of virus widely existing in nature. It is the largest known RNA virus in the genome and is named coronavirus, as its form is similar to the crown under the electron microscope. Coronavirus only infects vertebrates and is related to many diseases of humans and animals. It can cause respiratory tract, digestive tract, and nervous system diseases of humans and animals.\n2. What are the physical and chemical characteristics of the coronavirus?\nCoronavirus is sensitive to heat and can be effectively inactivated by 56 \u2103 for 30 minutes, ethyl ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peracetic acid, and chloroform.\n3. What are the coronaviruses that can infect people?\nSo farI in addition to the new coronavirus, we have found six kinds of coronaviruses such like HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, and MERS-CoV that can infect humans. Four of them are common in the population, with low pathogenicity, generally only causing mild respiratory symptoms similar to the common cold. The other two are well-known SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) coronaviruses and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) coronaviruses.\n4. What is the pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus?\nPneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus was found in central China\u2019s Wuhan City, Hubei Province in December 2019. It has been proved to be an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by a new type of coronavirus. The new coronavirus is a new strain of coronavirus that has not yet been previously found in the human body. The World Health Organization named the coronavirus 2019-nCov, namely a new coronavirus.\n5. What are the clinical manifestations of someone infected with a novel coronavirus?\nFever, weakness and dry cough are the main manifestations. Nasal obstruction, runny nose and other upper respiratory symptoms are rare. About half of the patients develop dyspnea after one week, and the severe cases develop rapidly into ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), septic shock, difficult-to-tackle metabolic acidosis and bleeding and coagulation dysfunction. It should be noted that the course of severe and critical patients can be moderate to low fever or even no obvious fever. Some patients have mild onset symptoms. These patients may have no fever and recover after 1 week. Most patients have a good prognosis, while a few patients are in critical condition or even death.\n6. Is there a vaccine for a novel coronavirus?\nThere is no vaccine available for the new disease. It may take a long time to develop a new vaccine for it.\n7. How to define whether a person is in close contact with the patient?\nClose contacts refer to people who live, study, work or have close contact with the case; medical staff, family members or other people who have similar close contact with the case without taking effective precautions when diagnosing, treating, nursing or visiting the case; other patients and caregivers in the same ward with the case; people who take the same vehicle with the case and have close contact with the case; and people who are evaluated as the qualified by the field investigators.\n8.Why should close contacts be observed for 14 days?\nReferring to the incubation period of other diseases caused by coronaviruses, the new coronavirus case-related information, and current prevention and control practice, the medical observation period of close contacts was set as 14 days, and the close contacts should be observed at home.\n9.If you are informed by the disease control department that you are a close contact, what should you do?\nYou can carry out home medical observation as required. Don't be panic. Don't go out casually, and do a good job of observing your physical condition. Receive regular follow-up visits from doctors. In case of abnormal clinical manifestations such as fever and cough, report to local disease prevention and control institutions in time, and under their guidance, go to designated medical institutions for troubleshooting, diagnosis, and treatment, etc.\n10. Can the novel coronavirus infection be treated?\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has released a clinical guideline for severe acute respiratory tract infection caused by suspected novel coronavirus infection. At present, there is no specific treatment for the disease caused by 2019-nCoV. But using the diagnosis and treatment launched by the National Health Commission, using some antiviral drugs to treat patients may have a certain effect. In addition, combined with the experience and lessons of SARS treatment, we can know that we could give play to the unique advantages of China's medical system by using the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine which may have important value. In addition, supplementary care for infected people may be very effective.\n11. What are the basic coping strategies for severe cases of novel coronavirus infection?\nSet up pre-examination triage, so that the patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) can be identified and classified; immediately implement the correct infection prevention and control measures (IPC); early support treatment and monitoring; collect clinical specimens for laboratory diagnosis; deal with hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); management of septic shock; prevention of complications; antiviral treatment; special precautions for pregnant patients.\nPart II Epidemic Situation\n12. What is the current situation of epidemic evolution?\nRecently, 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia outbroke in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, and other regions. As of at 24:00, January 30th, the National Health Commission received the information from 31 provinces (areas and cities) and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps that there were 9,692 confirmed cases, of which 1,527 severe cases, 213 death cases, and 171 cases who have been cured.There are 15,238 suspected cases now. At present, there are 113,579 close contacts (Beijing removed 21 cases after double-check), and 4,201 people who have been removed from medical observation, 102,427 people who have been put under medical observation. 28 confirmed cases have been reported from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, including 12 in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 7 in Macao Special Administrative Region, and 9 in Taiwan.\nUpon approval from the State Council, the National Health Commission includes 2019-nCoV-infected pneumonia into category B infectious disease specified in the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, and prevention and control measures for category A infectious diseases are taken; quarantinable disease management specified in Frontier Health and Quarantine Law of The People's Republic of China are followed.\n13. Why are confirmed cases increasing so quickly in just a few days?\nBecause a virus nucleic acid detection kit has been developed. Recently, the related national scientific research institutions developed a virus nucleic acid detection kit rapidly. The detection kit can confirm whether there is a specific gene sequence in case samples or not by using a PCR-based approach. In other words, a novel coronavirus can be identified by detection kit; samples of cases can be judged quickly by comparison.\n14. What is the key to prevent and control the outbreak?\nThe key is to prevent \"super spreaders\u201d. Reducing the outflow of the people in Wuhan City is very important, and strict screening detection measures are taken in Wuhan City, especially body temperature detection. Those who have high body temperature are not recommended to leave Wuhan. The city limited inflow and outflow of people on January 23, 2020\uff0cwhich was the key measures to prevent and control the outbreak.\n15. What is the most effective way to prevent and control the outbreak at present?\nEarly detection, early reporting, early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment are the most effective measures. It is extremely important for the confirmed cases to get an effective isolation treatment to decrease transmission.\n16. What is the infection source of novel coronavirus?\nThe infection source of 2019-nCoV has not yet been found. The gene sequence of 2019-nCoV is similar to the SARS coronavirus. However, SARS coronavirus has been proved to stem from the coronavirus that wild animals (bat) carry. At present, most cases admitted have exposure history of \"Huanan Seafood Market,\" where the wild animals were sold, and vendors and customers there have the chance to be in contact with wild animals-carried coronavirus.\n17. Can novel coronaviruses be transmitted from person to person?\nThe cases by human-to-human transmission were found in Wuhan City and Guangdong Province; as of January 21, 2020, there were 15 health care workers infected in Wuhan City, which confirmed the virus could have human-to-human transmission.\n18. By which ways will people be infected?\nOn January 27, 2020, the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Infected by Novel Coronavirus (4th trial edition) pressed by the General Office of the National Health Commission and the General Office of the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine points out that the main transmission route is droplet transmission, plus contact transmission.\n19. Will the novel coronavirus mutate?\nThe 2019-nCoV is a new strain of coronavirus that has not yet been previously found in human body, so the virus mutation still needs to be monitored closely.\n20. Will the novel coronavirus be as fierce as SARS?\nThe studies show that 2019-nCoV is homologous with SARS, with the similarity of about 70% and with MERS, about 40%. Compared with SARS, 2019-nCoV has weak infectivity, but a good affinity with human respiratory epithelial cells, indicating certain infectivity for humans.\nPart III Prevention and Control Knowledge\n21. What are the main monitoring measures for the pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus?\nIn the course of pneumonia monitoring and daily diagnosis and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection, medical institutions at all levels and of various types should enhance the awareness of diagnosis and reporting of pneumonia cases of 2019-nCoV infection. For cases with fever, cough and other symptoms of unknown causes, they should pay attention to inquiring about the suspected exposure history within 14 days before the onset of the disease, the history of contact with wild animals, and the history of close contact with similar cases.\n22. How to prevent the novel coronavirus infection?\n(1) Make efforts to prevent respiratory infectious disease in winter and spring\nIt is presently in the high-incidence season of the winter and spring infectious diseases, the public should enhance health awareness, do more exercise, have a regular work and rest to improve their immunity.\nKeep proper indoor ventilation, avoid poorly ventilated and crowded places; medical masks shall be worn when going out.\nWash hands and nose when coming home. If fever and other respiratory symptoms, especially persistent fever occurs, go to hospitals as soon as possible.\n(2) Wear medical masks correctly\nWearing medical masks is an effective way of interrupting respiratory droplets transmission. Medical masks can prevent respiratory diseases properly. When wearing disposable medical masks, fully unfold folded surface, and cover mouth, nose, and lower jaw entirely, then compress nose clip, so masks and face are in full contact with each other.\nWash hands before wearing medical masks or avoid touching the inner side of masks while wearing masks to reduce masks pollution risk. Distinguish the inside and outside and up and down of masks, i.e., the light surface is the inside of masks, which closes to mouth and nose, and the dark surface is the outside of masks; the metal strip (nose clip) side is the upside of masks.\nReplace masks regularly; avoid wearing reversely, and even both sides.\n(3) Wash hands properly\nRemember to wash hands before eating, after toilet, coming home, coming into contact with garbage and touching animals. When washing hands, use running water and soap (liquid soap), with no less than 15 seconds for rubbing hands.\nFor the convenience of memory, rubbing steps are as follows.\n- Both hands rub with palm to palm\n- Both hands cross and rub with palm to hand back\n- Fingers cross and rub with palm to palm\n- Fingers entwine and rub rotationally\n- Rub hands rotationally with thumb in the palm\n- Rub hands with fingertip in the palm\n- Wash wrist\n23. What should be paid special attention to when coming into contact with animals?\nAvoid coming into contact with wild livestock, wildlife, and their droppings and secretions, and avoid the purchase of live poultry and wildlife. Avoid visiting animal farms and slaughterhouses, live poultry and animal markets or stalls, wildlife habitats and so forth. People, especially occupationally exposed persons must take precautions when having to go the places mentioned above,. Avoid eating wild animals.\n24. When there are fever, cough and other symptoms, do you have to go to the hospital?\nThe symptoms such as pharyngeal pain, cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and so on may occur in the common cold, influenza, acute upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, bronchitis, and tonsillitis. When the above symptoms appear, it is generally a common respiratory tract infection. However, the patients infected with the 2019-nCoV mainly have fever, fatigue, and dry cough with less symptoms of the upper respiratory tract such as nasal congestion, runny nose.\nWhen a person has fever, cough, and other symptoms, and cannot accurately judge by himself, it is recommended to make a decision based on the WeDoctor's Digital general hospital online consultation. At present, hospitals in some cities gather a large number of patients with respiratory diseases. If they go to the hospital directly, they cannot effectively obtain useful information and are prone to get cross-infection. ",

        "content": "The Novel Coronavirus, otherwise known as the Wuhan Coronavirus has taken root in every major country now. It increases at a rate of approximately 1.4x every day. So if you have 10 cases today, you will have 14 tomorrow, 20 the next day, and so on. This is assuming a best case scenario, going off how the virus spread over the last few weeks in China.\nUnlike most outbreaks, like SARS (also a coronavirus), This one is basically unstoppable, given it\u2019s r0 of approx 3.5-4.7.\nWhat do I recommend at this point? Keep yourself informed by subscribing to the channel at the end of this article and watching the video above and the particularly the video below. So far he seems to be one of the few balanced and up to date sources for info on this virus.\nThe only real way to avoid contracting this virus is complete isolation. This is what the government of China has chosen to do based on their data. Rather than repeat the information, I suggest you watch the video below and all his past videos. This is the real deal.\nI have heard a number of people say, \u201cI will just do nothing and trust in God\u201d based on psalm 91. Now, I absolutely agree if you are taking all available precautions, yes, you can claim those promises, and to avoid panic, I suggest you read it and rest in the promises. However, it is important to note, God is not your fairy god mother. God expects you to do whatever you can, and he will fill the gap of what you can\u2019t do. God will not protect you from traffic if you walk out in front of it. He will not protect you if you intentionally jump off a cliff or play with dangerous snakes in an uncontrolled manner. God uses people to warn you, he gives you options, but you have to take them.\nAlso, you need to pray and listen closely. These events if not prevented by extreme measures, will have a drastic impact on the financial security of the world. It may be a precursor to many of the last day draconian laws that culminate in Sunday laws. However, God knows the future, he knows where you are, and what you can do in your given environment, so you need to pray and use your God given facilities to protect yourself and/or your friends and family.\nOpposition\nBe aware, that due to the nature of geometric progression, the virus will appear to move very slowly in your country for the next week or so. You will be called crazy and many different things by friends and family if you take the necessary steps to avoid the virus, just as Noah was. Trust the data, and while panic is useless in this situation, a healthy respect for this dangerous virus is not. A geometric progression will take 67 days to go from 2 to 8 billion cases. Obviously this will slow as people wake up, however, due to the long period of asymptomatic spread of this virus, you don\u2019t have long to act. There are likely far more people infected than is represented by the data.\nMost importantly get right with God and family members.\nGod is in control, and many will be put in the grave to save them before the end. Any issues you have, get on the phone and try to resolve it where possible. Life is short, and for a significant portion of the population, it just got a lot shorter.\nSo on that note, pray for your friends and family members and stay informed.

The workers\u2019 union issued a statement saying that they will not resume working until all back wages are paid, and the company acknowledges their right to collective bargaining.\nStrikes have been widespread throughout Iran for the past two years, as companies across multiple economic sectors have simply not paid their employees. Labor activists blame the regime\u2019s pseudo-privatization program for this state of affairs, as regime officials shifted formerly state-owned enterprises into their own hands, and embezzled their capital for themselves, while leaving the workers to their own fate.\nMeanwhile, Hassan Habibi, the secretary of Tehran provincial council, has admitted that Iranian workers are paid the lowest average wages in the region. According to him, the average Iranian earns $6 a day, or $2,160 a year (and his numbers are higher than many other estimates), much less than workers in every other country in the Middle East, despite Iran having a much more developed economy than some of those other countries.\nLabor activists are now organizing to demand the regime double Iran\u2019s minimum wage when it issues its next government budget in March. By the activists\u2019 calculations, a minimum decent quality of life in Iran costs $364 a month, while the current minimum wage is only $146 a month. New Regime Hacking Scheme Exposed\nThe computer hacking group \u201cCharming Kitten\u201d \u2013 known in recent years as a part of the Khomeinist regime\u2019s intelligence cyber operations \u2013 has been caught attempting to hack the computers of exiled Iranian journalists, and various Western academics and analysts, by posing as well-known journalists seeking interviews.\nAs revealed by the \u201cComputer Emergency Response Team in Farsi,\u201d (CERTFA) the regime agents stole the identity of New York Times reporter Farnaz Fassihi (who herself is viewed by Iranians as being sympathetic to the Khomeinists), and sent out fake interview requests to Baha\u2019i religious organizations (one of the faiths persecuted by the regime), an Iranian-German professor (Erfan Kasraie), and an exiled Iranian film director, Hassan Sarbakhshian.\nInterestingly, the data analyzed by CERTFA indicates ties between the regime hackers and the National Iranian American Council (NIAC), the regime\u2019s Washington D.C. lobby.\nOther journalists who had their identities stolen by Charming Kitten phishers include Samantha Vinograd of CNN, Michael Hartlep of Deutsche Welle, and Azadeh Shafiee of Iran International.\nBehzad Mesri, who is believed to run the Charming Kitten group, is currently wanted by the US FBI. In 2018, the group had attempted to hack the US Treasury Department. Iran Cuts Oil Production, As Unsold Barrels Pile Up\nTehran\u2019s supply of unsold oil remains around 100 million barrels \u2013 practically the same figure it was six months ago \u2013 a new sign of just how effective the US\u2019s maximum pressure sanctions campaign is. As the regime has been unable to find any new purchasers of Iranian oil, it has decided to cut production down to 2.1 million barrels per day. 1.8 million of those barrels are consumed internally, while 300,000 barrels are exported to the regime\u2019s two remaining customers- the Bashar Asad regime in Syria, and China. Neither one of these importers is a source of profit for Tehran, as China does not pay for the oil, but instead accepts the deliveries from Iran as payment for debts Tehran owes Beijing. The limited Chinese imports of Iranian oil are now even beginning to decrease, after Beijing signed a preliminary trade agreement with the USA last month.\nThus, the Trump administration can claim a success in its aim to stop the regime from selling oil.\nThe post IRAN ROUNDUP Jan. 30th \u2013 Feb. 7th: Corona Virus Spreads into Iran, as Khomeinist Regime Brass Safeguards Trade with Their Chinese Masters appeared first on The Gateway Pundit .

This emphatic denial was made by DOH Regional Director Dr. Minerva Molon during a hastily prepared media briefing on Friday (Jan.24) morning. The denial of Molon came in the wake of posts on social media that a 36-year old man, purportedly coming from Wuhan, China, arrived in the city last Jan.17. According to the World Health Organization, signs of the infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Reports say the incubation period of the coronavirus remains unknown, but other sources say it could be between 10 to 14 days. \u201cLet me emphasize that there is no novel corona virus infection in Tacloban. Just because this person allegedly came from Wuhan as reported on the social media. Only the Secretary of Health who can confirm any cases because we don\u2019t have yet scientific basis to declare there is an infection in Tacloban,\u201d Molon said. But during a press briefing conducted at the central office of the health department, it said that the case of the 36-year old man is being treated as a \u2018suspected case\u2019 due to his history travel and experienced respiratory illness. Molon said that if ever there is really a person said to have acquired the deadly virus, the department of health will discuss and treat the matter according to their protocol. She also cautioned the health workers if ever they know a patient under their care and is suspected to have the symptoms of the illness not to post it on social media but inform her or any assigned health official in the region to show respect on the person. The regional DOH office has established surveillance teams to hospitals, particularly government-owned, to know if there is a patient confined suspected to have the dreaded virus. But still, the post, whose origin has yet to be determined, created a scare among residents of this city, prompting Molon to ask netizens to check their informations to concerned government offices like the DOH in order not to create unnecessary and unfounded panic. \u201cLet us all help to pacify the public and if we don\u2019t have basis on this, let us minimized in posting this so as not to create panic,\u201d she added.

State health departments that have identified a PUI should immediately contact CDC\u2019s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 and complete a 2019-nCoV PUI case investigation form available below.

At this time, diagnostic testing for 2019-nCoV can be conducted only at CDC.\nTesting for other respiratory pathogens should not delay specimen shipping to CDC. If a PUI tests positive for another respiratory pathogen, after clinical evaluation and consultation with public health authorities, they may no longer be considered a PUI. This may evolve as more information becomes available on possible 2019-nCoV co-infections.\nFor biosafety reasons, it is not recommended to perform virus isolation in cell culture or initial characterization of viral agents recovered in cultures of specimens from a PUI for 2019-nCoV.\nTo increase the likelihood of detecting 2019-nCoV infection, CDC recommends collecting and testing multiple clinical specimens from different sites, including two specimen types\u2014lower respiratory and upper respiratory. Additional specimen types (e.g., stool, urine) may be collected and stored. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a PUI is identified regardless of time of symptom onset.

Truck Overturn\nA Vietnamese truck rolled over on to its side on the road to Xepon (Savannakhet). The truck was carrying processed wood. According to eyewitnesses, the accident caused 5 hours of traffic. Fortunately, no casualties were reported. The cause of the truck overturn is still being investigated. Moving Houses\nThese villagers in Houaphanh took the meaning of \u201chelping each other move houses\u201d to a whole new level. Men, women, and children of all ages came together to help pull the house on stilts to a location a few meters away. For many social media users in the urban areas, this was truly a sight to behold. But for many others on city outskirts and rural areas, this was a commonplace event. Some even offered this as a business service (for smaller, more mobile homes). The Woman In the Red Dress\nLast week was all about the Lunar New Year. Locals with both Chinese and Vietnamese ancestry gathered together to celebrate this momentous occasion. A beautiful woman dressed in a Chinese traditional red dress was featured on Tholakhong, and the social media crowd almost overwhelmingly concluded that this was not a Lao woman, and that she had to be either Vietnamese or Chinese, or mixed. Eating & Studying\nA purposely comical video of a famous teen idol sneaking in bites of cup noodles amidst a lecture in university seemed to resonate with many former and current students. Good Samaritan\nAn upstanding citizen has been praised on social media for his honest ethic. Phonexay Thongpaseuth went to a convenience store to purchase top-up phone cards and requested five 10,000 kip cards and one 50,000 kip card, totaling 100,000 kip. When he got home, he realized that the staff member who had sold him the cards had mistakenly given him five 100,000 kip cards worth quite a lot. The good samaritan promised to return the cards so that the staff member would not be penalized for his error. No More Entry Fees For the Vat Phou Festival\nA notice issued by the Champasak Provincial Administrative Office stated that there will be no more entry fees at the annual Vat Phou Festival to be held this 6-8 February.\nFor more pictures on the activities of festivals in the past, click here . Beloved Thai News Anchor Sentenced to Prison\nThe Thai Supreme Court sentenced Sorrayuth Suthassanachinda, one of Thailand\u2019s most well-known and highest-paid news anchormen, to 8 years in jail for embezzlement.\nThe Thai courts found the 53-year-old veteran journalist guilty of embezzling over 138 million baht that rightfully belonged to the Mass Communication Organization of Thailand (MCOT). The embezzlement took place while Sorrayuth was the host of a news program on Channel 9, a media outlet of MCOT, between 2005 and 2006. Sorrayuth has since paid back all the money to MCOT.\nSorrayuth shot to fame with his uniquely aggressive style of news presentation and won the attention of Lao viewers, many of whom follow news from Thai television media. \u201c Leuang Lao Chao Nee ,\u201d the Channel 3 morning news program co-hosted by Sorrayuth, was followed by a huge percentage of Lao audiences. Thai Robinson Gold Shop Killer Arrested\nLao social media users praised foreign police as they arrested the man responsible for the shopping mall looting and shooting of 3 people, including a 2-year-old boy in Lopburi, Thailand. The most disturbing part of the case was that the suspect was a 39-year-old civil servant and director of a primary school who confessed that he robbed and killed for fun. Two Men Shot to Death Near 450-Year Road\nHatsayfong police are on the lookout for the killer of two men, who were shot to death while in their car in vacant land in the 450-Year Road. One of the murdered men\u2019s girlfriends had ventured to search for her boyfriend after not being able to contact him. His phone\u2019s built-in GPS location had led her to locate his whereabouts. Corona Virus Hotline\nThe public is urged to call 166 if anyone is suspected of having been infected by the Corona Virus, according to a Ministry of Health notice. A 24-hour mobile number is also available: 02054066777. 19-Year-Old Girl Among Those Sentenced to Death For Drug Trafficking\nThe Lao Security News has reported that a Vientiane court has issued death sentences to 8 of 22 convicted drug traders . Among them is a 19-year-old female named Pavina (nickname: Julie) who was found guilty of drug trafficking as well as money laundering. An overwhelming number of Lao support the death penalty for drug traffickers. One user asked whether drug lord Sisouk Daoheuang had been put on trial, to which the admin of the Lao Security News Facebook Page replied that the sentencing would happen at another time.",

They were evacuated from Wuhan in two special Air India flights on February 1 and 2. Getting to the airport was possibly the toughest journey fearing the Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) with every passing moment. Now safely back in India, their troubles should have diminished but not so.\nNearly 300 persons (25 from Kerala), mainly students are now quarantined in two camps\u2014in Manesar near Gurgaon and the other, a camp of Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force (ITBPF) in Haryana. The men are housed in the Manesar camp while the women at the ITBPF camp. The lack of basic facilities in the Manesar camp like clean toilets and buckets to collect water have only heightened their fears on how to combat the killer virus in such conditions when the WHO advisory stresses the highest standards of hygiene and frequent washing of hands with soap and water.\nThe Journey from Wuhan\nThe students at the Manesar camp which has around 15 Keralites among them said that it was in December that they first heard about a dangerous virus detected in humans at Wuhan in Hubei province of China. Wuhan is the largest city in the Province and known as the transportation hub of China.\n\u201cFirst the news was that SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which saw a deadly outbreak in 2002, killing 349 in China was detected and the situation was well under control. We were busy with our classes and by January 11, we heard the news on the Chinese media and on BBC that it was a new deadly nCoV and that\u2019s when we started panicking,\u201d Faizal Nazar, a fifth year MBBS student from Kerala, at Wuhan University said.\nHe said that he immediately rang up the Indian Embassy officials in Beijing and was advised to keep calm and that everything was under control. \u201cThe panic and anxiety peaked by January 23 when there was an official announcement that the Wuhan airport would be shut in view of the Coronavirus outbreak. Most of us had by then booked air tickets to fly back home but could not do so as the airport was closed,\u201d Faizal added.\nFive-hour-long journey on a Bullet train\nAccording to these students housed in Manesar, those who had fled Wuhan before the Air India flights could be arranged may have contracted the virus while travelling to a far-flung airport. The main reason could be their decision to travel on a bullet train for five hours to reach an airport that was still open and from there to fly back to India, nearly 3853 kilometres away. The railway station in Wuhan from where they had to board the bullet train had already detected several Corona-infected patients and the five-hour-long journey on the bullet train to catch the flight to India and other countries might have led to a virus jump from person to person.\n\u201cNearly half of the Indian students in Wuhan University are from Kerala and there are also several students from other Indian states as well. There were nearly 500 Indian students in Wuhan University and at present less than 10 students have stayed back,\u201d Nazar said.\nThe students from the university said that with the shutdown of the Wuhan airport they started putting pressure on the officials at the Indian Embassy and they also rang up media persons in India. And finally, two specially-prepped Boeing 747 Jumbo aircraft of Air India landed in Wuhan Airport with the permission of the Chinese government on two consecutive days to bring back a total of 650 persons including seven Maldivians by February 2.\nFaizal, who was on board the first flight said that the University had arranged for a bus to the airport from the campus by coordinating with the Indian Embassy and there were 58 Indians on the bus from the campus. \u201cWhen we reached the airport, there were Indian students from other universities as well. Most of the passengers were students and there were also a few Indian business people on the first flight,\u201d he added.\nManesar Camp\nBut the ordeal has not ended for these Indians for the Manesar camp where 300 persons are lodged lack toilet facilities and water. \u201cThere are only three portable toilets for 300 persons and single bucket for 10 persons at Manesar camp. We have been talking to the authorities at the camp but were told that in army camps the facilities are limited and we need to adjust for the next two weeks until we are allowed to travel to our homes (if cleared off all nCoV symptoms). It\u2019s important that the camp is well equipped when hygiene is of utmost importance to save us from the dreaded virus, in case anyone of us is infected,\u201d a student at the Manesar camp, who wishes to remain anonymous, said.\nHowever, they were happy to say that were provided with quality food and facilities at the ITBPF camp where the women were lodged. The student also said that going by the response of the officials in charge of the Manesar camp, there was no hope of getting proper facilities like more toilets and buckets in the coming days.\nFive persons from Manesar who were earlier shifted to a hospital as they showed symptoms of Corona have tested negative for the virus.",

        "content": "Nearly all the deadly infections of the corona virus are localized in the centre of the epidemic in and near Wuhan in the province of Hubei, China. This analysis leads to two main types of contamination: 1) breathing in the virus after a nearby contaminated person coughs or sneezes and 2) contracting the virus via the fecal-oral route, due to poor hygiene, that is not washing your hands. Of these two methods, the first is very dangerous. From the point of view of epidemics, the second form is potentially as dangerous as the first one. But for most individuals that are treated well the consequence of being contaminated seems to be no more deadly than a normal flu. Even so, the danger for whole populations and even for whole continents remains huge: every infected individual, who is not properly treated, can lead to a huge and dangerous epidemic.\nIntroduction\nThere is a large difference in fatality for people infected in Wuhan and the surrounding area and for people that are infected outside the province of Hubei. Nearly all deadly cases can be traced back to contamination in Wuhan, Hubei. This observation requires an explanation.\nBecoming infected in Wuhan is more dangerous than becoming infected elsewhere\nOutside Mainland China, the disease has resulted in death only in Hong Kong and the Philippines. Both victims traveled from Wuhan in the province of Hubei where they were infected.*\nOutside of the province of Hubei (the origin of the epidemic) contamination by the virus seems to be much less deadly for individuals that were contaminated. Outside the province of Hubei there are only 14 deaths, out of a total of 563** deaths. Nearly all of that small number of deaths, in the rest of Mainland China, seem to have been infected in or near Wuhan, Hubei.\nThis leads to the simple conclusion that individuals that have been infected in Wuhan are at greater risk than people that are infected outside Wuhan.\nThe question is: why?\nTypes of infections\nFrom tuberculosis we know that there are two main types: the so called \u2018open tbc\u2019 and \u2018closed tbc\u2019. Open tbc (lungs involved) is very contaminating and the consequences are far more severe.\nFor the Wuhan coronavirus various ways of contamination are proposed ***: Spread from person to person through respiratory droplets emitted by coughing or sneezing. Airborne \u2013 meaning: the virus is able to travel across a large room. The fecal-oral route. Viruses from a diarrhea can be transmitted by hands or other means to the respiratory system of the infected person.\nThis analysis leads to the conclusion that a fourth one should be added:\n4. The fecal-manual route. A first infection in the digestive system of the first person is transmitted by \u2018shaking hands\u2019 with secondary persons that may transmit the infection to their own digestive system, causing a primary reaction like diarrhea.\nOrigin and spread of infections of the new corona virus\nIn the city of Wuhan which is the origin of the epidemic 55% of the first contaminations are proven to come from a market. In first instance the digestive systems of one or more customers of the market must have been infected by eating contaminated food, causing a diarrhea.\nIf the virus is first infecting the intestines of a patient the body probably has more time to activate its defense system after which a person gets protection by antibodies, constraining the severity of the contamination: \u201c Reports point to mildly symptomatic but infectious cases of 2019-nCoV [2019 Novel Coronavirus], which were not a feature of SARS.\u201d\nProbably by the fecal-oral route, the respiratory system of one or more of the first victims, must have been reached in a second case, resulting in severe respiratory problems and in many deadly further cases.\nIn Wuhan contamination by respiratory droplets has been directly infecting the lungs of other victims nearby, resulting in many deaths for Wuhan and nearby. When large quantities of viruses are directly transmitted from lung to lung a totally unprepared and unprotected body gets a big problem from the very first moment: a viral load of up to 10 8 copies per milliliter is mentioned \u2013 100 million viruses per milliliter.\nBesides the above route the virus is transmitted via the fecal-manual route by seemingly healthy people whose digestive system has been infected but who are not aware of the type of infection or not even of becoming ill. People that are infected through the digestive route may or may not develop sickness symptoms like a diarrhea. These people themselves could not have or show problems in their respiratory system but they are still able to contaminate other people. For example, by simply shaking hands with other people with a hand with slight traces of the virus. The danger of a less than perfect hygiene (which is rather common) and more especially the hygiene in squat latrines has been mentioned in this informative article .\nThe fecal-manual route of contamination probably has been the case in most of the illness cases in the rest of Mainland China and in most of the secondary cases in foreign countries where corona infected people from China, not having respiratory problems, traveled to. The infection by an infected guest in the factory in Germany probably was transmitted by \u2018just shaking hands\u2019, which is what people in firms are used to doing when they meet each other.\nConsequences\nIf the above analysis is correct, in case of sickness, two types of contamination must be distinguished: by the fecal-manual route by the respiratory route\nThe last one is by far the most dangerous for the individual because it directly affects the fragile lung system even before the slightest resistance in the body could have been built up. Both varieties however are very contagious and can spread the virus to many people which means that both varieties have more or less the same potential in creating a dangerous epidemic.\nAfter recognizing the \u2018dangerous\u2019 and the \u2018less dangerous\u2019 variant different ways can be followed. The \u2018respiratory group\u2019 needs 100% isolation. For the other group 100% strict hygienic prevention measures should be enough to prevent further spreading. A \u2018contactless period\u2019 is needed but further complications for the infected person are much less probable which facilitates treatment and recovery.\nThe Big Danger\nBy seemingly healthy people the disease can travel to other locations and can be spread by persons that are not showing symptoms of the disease. The spread of this highly infectious disease might already have taken place to less equipped countries. In poor countries further containing of the very contagious disease will be more difficult than in China or in other more developed countries.\nNew possibilities for killing the epidemic?\nThe fact that people develop resistance against the disease by slight infections of the digestive system possibly opens up new ways to fight the epidemic. But it is not easy to imagine how this could happen without self-contamination of the lung system of some individuals or without transmitting considerable quantities of the virus to the people in the environment \u2013 things that happen during the uncontrolled spread of the virus.\nConclusions\nFrom the geographical spread of confirmed cases of the corona virus the difference between two main types of contamination is inferred.\nFirst there is, for individuals, the less dangerous contamination that only affects the digestive system of a patient. The patient himself often develops less severe symptoms but is still able to contaminate many other people by fecal-manual transmission.\nSecond there is the very dangerous variant in which the respiratory system is affected.\nIn case of \u2018lung to lung\u2019 transmission of infections the natural defense system of infected people does not have enough time to develop natural resistance against the disease. Very soon the patient is very ill and highly contagious in the most dangerous way. It is the contamination of the respiratory system that causes most deaths.\nOutside Wuhan/Hubei contamination by the fecal-manual route probably is the most common way of becoming infected. This type of infection is less problematic in its direct effects because usually only the digestive system is involved. For the affected individual the contamination usually has less severe consequences but from the point of view of contaminating other people a high risk remains. Strict hygiene is needed.\nDistinguishing the two forms of contamination, eases treatment decisions. Distinguishing the two forms of transmission leads to better and more efficient policies in fighting and constraining the epidemic.\nDisclaimer: The author is a geographer, not a medical specialist nor an epidemiologist.

Russia , Mongolia, and North Korea closed their borders Thursday. Hong Kong announced a temporary closure. Singapore has now closed its borders too. Mark Steyn meanwhile, marvels that healthy US citizens are being advised not to go to China , but it\u2019s apparently fine for sick people to travel the other way. Extraordinarily a cruise ship with 6,000 passengers was \u201cstuck\u201d off Italy, waiting for clearance for two Chinese people who had symptoms like a flu. Fortunately they must have just had the flu. The ship was cleared. And so it is around the world with a mosaic pattern of super actions, versus business as usual.\nBritish Airways has suspended all flights to and from China, as have many other airlines , but in a city by city way. The virus is now present in every region of China. It\u2019s not clear why all flights to and from China have not been stopped. On ABC news Australia\u2019s supposedly top medico didn\u2019t explain why, just palmed off the decision as advice from the WHO. Red flags anyone? A union of pilots in the US is so concerned they are suing American Airlines in a bid to stop them flying there to protect crews. They are calling for staff to refuse work trips to high-risk locations. On #CoronaOutbreak there are photos of shelves emptying in Shanghai, people are wearing giant juice bottles on their heads, and not wearing a face mask is considered a bad thing \u2014 indeed, people are being arrested for not wearing face masks. Videos apparently show people being forcibly locked inside houses because of their suspected infections.\nThe first case of human to human transmission has been confirmed in the US and 168 people are now on a watchlist. Passengers on one flight in Australia have just been advised they were travelling on Monday night with a man who has been diagnosed. 200 people are being contacted. The plane flew another 13 legs or so before it got a proper clean and that contact list might, yeah, well\u2026 The sick man was part of a group of eight who toured the risky part of China, four of the eight have symptoms and all eight are in isolation.\nThe live map and official Corona Virus tally (for whatever that means) is 213 deaths and 9,776 confirmed infections, plus or minus 2,000 or 80,000 (Uni HK below). But 100 or so cases are now confirmed outside China, so we are on the cusp of a global epidemic.\nAnd yes, apparently, before that even happens, the Climate Doomsters are already predicting Climate Change will increase t he odds of the next one. Never let a good crisis go to waste. h.t Pat John Hopkins CSSE\u2026 Live Map 31-Jan-2019\nOminously, the \u201ctotal officially recovered\u201d, is just 187 \u2014 by this tally, more have died than survived. But this is probably just a measure of those who got the most severe form of the disease and also managed to survive an overcrowded and underfunded Chinese ICU. Added to this, Wuhan is an industrial town with heavy air pollution \u2013 known as \u201cthe Chicago of China\u201d or China\u2019s Smog City. That can\u2019t be too good for local lungs. The guesstimate on the BBC is that about a quarter of people get \u201cthe bad form\u201d.\nIt\u2019s likely that many other people have already caught this in China, but didn\u2019t get deadly sick, and didn\u2019t go to hospital and are not counted here at all. The virus may even cause subclinical, or low grade barely detectable disease in some, though in this world of unknowns, there are undoubtedly other deaths that may not be included in the tally too \u2014 misdiagnosed or undiagnosed and just rushed to the crematorium.\nWHO says the death rates are 2% though no one really knows. A recent paper in Lancet estimates 11% . The fact is, there are no facts we can rely on. (h.t Mishtalk) But if that Lancet paper is closer to the mark, there is a gargantuan trainwreck coming. Quick, someone explain exponential curves to the people in power. We need to act like lightning to head this off.\nSome estimate put the number of people infected at tens of thousands higher (see estimates below). It did seem odd that a city of 11 million suddenly needed new \u201c2-minute-hospitals\u201d to cope with a few thousand patients. Someone knew something. Indeed, there are many fishy things about this, including those fish markets which may or may not be the source. There is that odd coincidence of China\u2019s first high level biosafety laboratory being also in Wuhan and working with Corona viruses as well as Ebola and SARS . There were warnings.\nBelow is the official trajectory. What we really want to see on this graph below is any kind of leveling off. Instead, we see 1000 become 10,000 in a week. And the more people infected, the more opportunity for mutations. And if there are wildlife vectors, it will run amok and stick around. John Hopkins CSSE\u2026 Live Map 31-Jan-2019 Here\u2019s hoping\u2026\nCommunist governments aside, the Chinese people are smart enough and motivated to slow things themselves. Social media and the rapid spread of fear is driving people to isolate themselves, so the epidemic may plateau sooner and lower than the worst projections. There is action. Some towns and even apartment blocks are getting organised and cutting themselves off. As long as people can stay inside and avoid public gatherings long enough, it will help. The rate of spread\nEstimates of the R o or Reproductive number are in the 2 \u2013 3 range (or lately 1.4 \u2013 2.5 ) but changing fast. An R o of 2 means one person is likely to infect 2 others, which makes it on par with influenza in terms of spreadability (and thus \u201cstoppability\u201d once it has gained a foothold).\nR o examples: Ebola, 1.5 \u2013 2.5; Influenza 2 \u2013 3; Munps 4 \u2013 7; Polio and Smallpox 5 \u2013 7; Measles 12 \u2013 18.\nObviously R o matters: Bigger numbers mean faster, higher peaks. Without intervention, the number starts to flatten when enough people are immune through having had it and recovered. Alternately, careful tracing of contacts with vaccination can slow the spread sooner. I\u2019m guessing that even a vaccine with a short lived efficacy would slow transmission and be useful in an emergency situation. Ro, Reproductive curves of infectious diseases. ResearchGate\nObviously an R o of 1 or less means a disease will shrink away to nothing. So if quarantine measures are strong enough, and the effective R o can be reduced, infections will plateau and shrink. But it will take aggressive and quick action to achieve that. Exponential curves are so unforgiving. Doubling every 6 days?\nThe University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) reported on Jan 27th that the 2019- nCoV spread in China\u2019s cities could trigger a global epidemic . \u2026experts from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) estimated that the number of cases in Wuhan as of Jan 25 was dramatically higher than the country\u2019s official totals and may be as high as 44,000. They also estimated that the city\u2019s cases will double over the next 6 days. They said that about 25,000 people in Wuhan are likely symptomatic and the others are still in the incubation period.\nNote that other estimates are very different (eg Uni of Lancashire = 11,000) Estimates of epidemic spread, CoronaVirus, Jan 25th, 2020 | Mishtalk\nThey estimate the peak in China will not occur until April or May. That is a lot of doublings away\u2026 Based on outbreak data and train, air, and road travel from Wuhan\u2014which is central China\u2019s transportation hub\u2014they said Chongqing could be the next most affected city, because of its strong transport ties to Wuhan. They said outbreaks in Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen could peak in April or May and gradually slow in June and July.\nWith 8 to 12 doublings til the peak in China, if there are 80,000 infections now, in six weeks there could be 5 million. In 8 weeks 20 million, and in 12 weeks 320 million. If there are only 10,000 now, it may mean the same thing with a three-week delay. But that three weeks could make a huge difference to the final tally if the rate of doubling can be slowed aggressively now. Every day counts.\nThese estimates are jelly in every sense. The official graph from the John Hopkins live map above suggests the doubling time is much faster than 6 days. What do you do in a lockdown?",

The spread of this disease has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization.\nThe test, developed by OMRF and OU Health Sciences Center scientists and utilizing Fluidigm products, is intended for large-scale testing of patients across the OU Medicine health care system. OU Medicine has applied for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the test from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with FLDM. Click here to check it out. FLDM 30-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of FLDM Peter Lynch Chart of FLDM \u201cSolutions that offer scale and high-speed processing are critically important in ramping up testing capabilities for COVID-19,\u201d said OMRF President Stephen Prescott, MD. \u201cWe anticipate that the test will generate several thousand test results per day, and it comes online at a particularly critical time for COVID-19 patients in Oklahoma.\u201d\nHigh-complexity labs certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments in the United States are eligible under new FDA guidance to create their own diagnostic test kits for COVID-19. OU Medicine, the University of Oklahoma and OMRF are among academic and government organizations utilizing Fluidigm microfluidics technology and reagents in COVID \u2011 19 testing. The institutions validated a workflow designed to be run on the Fluidigm Biomark\u2122 HD system.\n\u201cWe are grateful for the collaboration and leadership of the researchers at OU Health Sciences Center and OMRF. This partnership with three Oklahoma health care leaders and Fluidigm makes it possible for OU Medicine to offer this unique testing capability to our state,\u201d said Chuck Spicer, FACHE, President and CEO of OU Medicine, Inc. \u201cWe believe this greatly increased number of tests will serve as a turning point in our battle against the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\u201cReadily accessible and rapid testing for COVID-19 not only expedites treatment for patients who test positive, but it allows health care providers to be routinely tested to ensure their safety and that of everyone they encounter. Increased testing will also allow more patients without COVID-19 to access specialty care at OU Medicine, including surgeries, procedures and other diagnostic testing,\u201d Spicer said.\n\u201cThe remarkable volume of testing made available through the tireless work of our OU Health Sciences Center researchers and partners at OU Medicine, OMRF and Fluidigm is, simply put, game-changing,\u201d said OU Interim President Joseph Harroz, Jr. \u201cAs this innovative testing platform ramps into full capacity, we will be able to ensure Oklahoma has consistent testing for the current environment and for possible future outbreaks, as well as demographic and geographic sampling that can help contain further spread.\u201d\nMicrofluidics technology generates more data and uses a fraction of expensive testing reagents per sample as compared with more traditional, microwell plate-based PCR technology. Fluidigm Biomark HD and the company\u2019s microfluidics technology, in particular, enable automated high-throughput assembly of PCRs at the nanoscale level.\n\u201cSince the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, adequate resources for testing have been a serious challenge for health care systems around the world,\u201d said Chris Linthwaite, President and CEO of Fluidigm. \u201cSpeed, scale and automation are critical components for delivering timely results. The Biomark HD platform can generate more than 6,000 individual test results per day with just one hour of hands-on time. A single system supports more than 2 million annual tests, and we are partnering with labs around the world to build out critically needed testing infrastructure.\u201d\n\u201cWe are excited to support OU Medicine, the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation and the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center in this incredibly important program. In parallel with this scaling of testing capacity, Fluidigm products are providing vital information on immune response to COVID-19 exposure. This information is essential for evaluation of patient management approaches and effective development of vaccines and therapeutic candidates. The COVID-19 testing program for Oklahoma City positions that community at the forefront of pandemic preparation efforts in the global fight against this virus.\u201d\nIn a separate program, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and a group of other U.S. medical schools are developing a new epigenetic test for early COVID-19 detection designed for the Biomark HD, with the intent to seek EUA from the FDA.\nAbout Fluidigm\nFluidigm ( NASDAQ:FLDM ) focuses on the most pressing needs in translational and clinical research, including cancer, immunology, and immunotherapy.

        "content": "The heroic efforts of researchers and healthcare professionals globally will eventually help us gain control of the coronavirus pandemic and there will be a decrease in the rate of new infections. The focus is still rightly on the damage this pandemic is causing, the devastating loss of life and the impact on businesses and livelihoods. But we also need to look at other prevalent crises that are affecting our healthcare systems and anticipate the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on them.\nOne of the greatest threats to healthcare systems, around the world, is antibiotic resistance. The lack of effective antibiotics and the emergence of bacteria that are resistant to the drugs we have has resulted in the antibiotic resistance crisis.\nMore than 90% of people will be prescribed an antibiotic at some point in their lives. But prescribing antibiotics is a finite process. We do not have an endless supply of antibiotics to replace those that are no longer effective, and hardly any new antibiotics are being developed. In the meantime, bacteria have become resistant to more of the antibiotics in routine use and even to antibiotics of last resort (drugs with severe side-effects that are only used when all other antibiotics have failed).\nWe have now reached a point where infections are being seen in hospitals around the world that are resistant to all known antibiotics.\nSecondary infections\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to huge numbers of people with compromised immune systems being admitted to hospitals, which are a known breeding ground for drug-resistant bacteria. Because of this influx, these hospital-associated bacteria will now have a much wider potential target group.\nEmerging evidence suggests that high numbers of COVID-19 patients are being diagnosed with secondary infections while in hospital. The source and specific nature of these infections are yet to be fully explored, but there is some evidence that multidrug-resistant bacteria are among the germs causing these secondary infections.\nThese secondary infections appear to be having an impact on patient survival, with data from Wuhan showing that half of all COVID-19 patients who died had a secondary infection. That is because many of these hospital-associated bacteria are specifically adapted to establish infection in people with a weakened immune system.\nHistory suggests that the mortality rate of viral pandemics is heavily influenced by secondary bacterial infections with large numbers of people in the 1918 and the 2009 flu pandemics succumbing to secondary bacterial infections rather than the virus itself.\nThe other factor that will have a significant impact on the antibiotic resistance crisis is the widespread use of antibiotics in COVID-19 patients.\nEmerging data suggests that more than 90% of COVID-19 patients are also receiving antibacterial treatment. This rapid increase in antibiotic use, particularly in hospitals, will apply a strong selective pressure on bacteria to evolve resistance. This will probably contribute to an increase in the incidence of drug-resistant infections in the months and years after the pandemic is over.\nA report published in 2016 suggested that by 2050, 10 million people a year could die from antibiotic-resistant infections. Given this prediction did not account for the devastating impact of COVID-19, this timeline will almost certainly have to be revised.\nHowever, concerted efforts are being made to better understand antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients. The US Department of Defense has just launched a study to track antibiotic usage and the rate of secondary infections among COVID-19 patients. The results of studies such as this will help guide doctors on when and how to prescribe antibiotics for COVID-19 patients.\nNew drugs\nAccording to the World Health Organization, 252 antibiotic drugs are in preclinical development - that is, they are currently being tested on animals. Unfortunately, only between two and five of these drugs will make it to market over the next decade.\nOne of the biggest hurdles in bringing these drugs to market is the prohibitive costs, which can be up to US$1 billion per drug (\u00a3816 million). This makes it difficult to recover investment and places a huge financial burden on the companies developing these drugs, many of which collapse under the strain. By addressing this financial burden and making the development of new antibiotics a global research priority, similar to what is being seen in the efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, we can ensure more of the antibiotics being developed make it to market.\nHopefully the response to the COVID-19 pandemic can be used as a blueprint in global cooperation to tackle the antibiotic resistance crisis, a threat that has the potential to cripple our healthcare systems and medicine as we know it.\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d now \"COVID-19\" coronavirus, which is unlike other coronaviruses encountered to date, has been identified as the causative agent of the epidemic. It has spread mainly in China, but also in other countries.\nTo discover all of our products for Clinical applications, please visit bioM\u00e9rieux Diagnostics website .\nThis new strain of coronavirus has never before been identified in humans. The symptoms are similar to a respiratory tract infection and, in some cases, severe pneumonia: cough, fever, difficulty breathing. Human-to-human transmission probably occurs through close contact with a sick person (shared living space, direct contact at less than 1 meter when coughing, sneezing or talking, and contact with surfaces and objects contaminated by an infected person taking no protective measures). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the incubation period lasts from 1 to 14 days. Coronavirus (2019-nCoV / COVID-19) diagnostic tests\nWhen a patient has a respiratory infection, diagnostic 19 . The test results support patient care decisions and enable the appropriate hygiene measures to be taken in order to limit the risk of transmission/contagion.\nbioM\u00e9rieux studied the genetic sequence of the 2019-nCoV / COVID-19 strain that appeared in Wuhan as soon as it became available. It turns out to be quite different from other strains of coronavirus that typically cause respiratory infections in humans. Consequently, the bioM\u00e9rieux tests that detect coronaviruses are not able to detect this new strain, 2019-nCoV / COVID-19 .\nTrue to its commitment to public health, bioM\u00e9rieux is specialized in the fight against infectious diseases. Right now, our research teams are working to urgently develop diagnostic tests to detect the 2019 coronavirus-nCoV / COVID-19.\n\u201cWe can count on the solid expertise of our teams, built on more than 55 years of experience in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. We know how to provide high medical value solutions and to mobilize the necessary means to help combat this epidemic, as we have done during past emergencies, such as when we developed diagnostic tests for the Ebola virus epidemic in 2014.\u201d",

Social media posts show people donning tangerine and grapefruit skins as masks, water-cooler bottle headgear, while pranksters have mocked the health crisis with absurd alternatives, including iceberg lettuce. It comes as Chinese health officials warned people not to re-use their protective masks after videos emerged of people boiling their surgical masks and hanging them up to dry. Medical experts warned that this greatly reduces the effectiveness of the masks, a spokeswoman for the Gansu province Health Commission added that they should be discarded after just four hours of use. With more than 50 million residents on lock-down and 170 deaths in the country, some provinces such as Guangdong have mandated that people wear masks and are handing out fines for offenders.

Teodoro Locsin Jr. said Tuesday that the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) from China is a \"challenge\" that \"will strengthen it in the eyes of the world as a power that just cannot be defeated even by nature.\"\nSpeaking at an inquiry by the Senate Committee on Health on the government's preparedness against the new virus strain, Locsin said \"this disease is only proving the resilience and strength of China.\"\n\"There is no doubt that there are people abroad, in the West who are perhaps happy that this is happening to China because this may spell the end of Chinese power,\" Manila's top diplomat said.\nBut, \"unfortunately for them,\" China's strength is manifesting amid the crisis, it even built its \"massive containment facility\" for the disease in 10 days, Locsin said.\n\"That only shows how strong the country is,\" he said.\nLocsin's remarks were made after Senate President Vicente Sotto III sought his reaction to a video that suggests, albeit unverified, that the 2019-nCoV was developed as a bioweapon.\n\"This is an example of the craziest video I have ever seen,\" he said.\nNonetheless, the foreign minister belied allegations \"that China even withheld information about this disease,\" disclosing that the country's consulate in Hong Kong received word about it from the Hong Kong government on Jan. 7.\n\"China was already spreading the news to all its administrative regions, who were then authorized to tell us that this is happening. Three days later, they discover the isolated virus,\" Locsin said.\n\"In short, even before they were sure of it, they were already warning everyone. From that point on, China was already warning us, and I assume warning all the other consulates and embassies about the progress of this disease,\" he added.\nThe 2019-nCoV was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December, and later spread, killing over 400 people and infecting over 20,000 others, mainly in China.\nThe Philippines recorded two confirmed cases, involving two Chinese nationals from Wuhan.

The U.S. created a robust 225,000 new jobs in January, and for the last three months it has accelerated from last summer and fall.\nThe economy looks like it is picking up from a sluggish 2019. The key for the stock market will be whether this translates to better earnings, since they were flat in 2019. It is a sign of hope for 2020.\nGeo-Political: Market action is being dominated by earnings season and the Corona virus . The market had a hard one day selloff the week before last, followed by a recovery in the week just ended. It seems the market thought it had over-reacted. I think we are still at the point where we don\u2019t know how this thing is going to go. In the past week, the number of reported cases worldwide jumped from 10K to 30K and the death toll has hit 700. Thirty countries report cases, but by the time you include China, Russia, India, the US, Canada, England, Germany, you have covered the majority of the populated land mass of the world. Africa and S. America have not reported cases yet.\nLet\u2019s also look at the ongoing Fed involvement in the repo market , which many view skeptically.\nDec. 7, 2019 \u2013 Initially, the central bank rolled out roughly $75 billion in daily lending facilities to arm Wall Street\u2019s core set of primary dealers with low-cost overnight loans to keep the roughly $1 trillion daily U.S. Treasury repo market running.\nThe facilities allow banks to snap up loans by pledging safe-haven U.S. Treasurys or agency mortgage-backed securities with the New York Fed, but crucially without the typical risk-based pricing that lenders regularly charge when funding each other.\nThe goal was to keep banks flush as they deal with month-end funding issues, corporate tax payments, and the deluge of Treasury debt being sold by the federal government to fund its deficit.\nShortly thereafter, former New York Fed markets group head Brian Sack, coauthored an article saying that the Fed could get a better control of overnight rates if it were to boost banking system reserves by purchasing $250 billion of Treasury debt.\nBut the Fed\u2019s total support already has eclipsed that threshold with the expansion of daily operations, the introduction of longer-term loans, and its balance sheet expansion through monthly T-bill purchases.\n\u201c This is now far bigger than anyone thought this was going to be,\u201d Bianco said. \u201cI think they\u2019re hoping the market will magically fix itself. I don\u2019t see why it would .\u201d\nAmid sustained clamor for Fed funding, the central bank in the last two weeks said it would increase two longer-term facilities to help carry borrowers through any year-end turbulence.\n\u201cThe Fed really hasn\u2019t figured out the problem,\u201d said Bryce Doty, a senior portfolio manager at Sit Fixed Income in Minneapolis. \u201cBut they kind of have created their own problem.\u201d\nBy that, Doty meant the Fed\u2019s rescue operations have worked in terms of supplying banks with quick and cheap funding, but less so when it comes to luring them back to funding each other.\n\u201cThe big banks are just hoarding cash,\u201d he said. \u201cThey told the Fed they have more than enough cash in excess reserves to meet regulatory issues, but they prefer having money at the Fed where they can still earn 1.55%, rather than in the repo market.\u201d\nJ.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said bank regulations were a factor in September\u2019s repo crisis while speaking on the bank\u2019s third-quarter earnings conference call, and in other recent forums he warned that short-term lending rates could again soar without more \u201cpermanent fixes,\u201d while avoiding an express call for rule changes .\nIn Congressional testimony on Wednesday, Randal Quarles, the Federal Reserve\u2019s point man on banking supervision appeared to side with Dimon, saying the existing regulatory framework \u201cmay have created some incentives\u201d that contributed to recent repo funding stress.\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-repo-market-is-broken-and-fed-injections-are-not-a-lasting-solution-market-pros-warn-2019-12-04\nThere is a lot there, and I have no banking background, so take anything I say with a grain of salt. But like you, whether I have all the banking background I would like, I must deal with this situation and try to understand it, and how it might impact me. So, here goes.\nBanks typically use the repo market to get access to cash by pledging collateral they hold, especially Treasury bonds. Other banks will lend them the money short term, with the bonds held as collateral. At the end of the term, the borrowing bank will repurchase the bonds that were used as collateral. A short term spike in rates occurred in Sept. because banks that typically lend money to other banks cut back on the amount they were able or willing to put into the repo market, and the remaining lenders demanded higher interest rates for their scarce money.\nSeveral options exist for why banks suddenly became unwilling to lend in the repo market.\nMaybe they were out of cash, or out of cash to lend. The article points out the \u201cdeluge of Treasury debt being sold by the federal government\u201d. It is possible that the impact of annual deficits exceeding $1 trillion is being felt in the banking system. They allude to the \u201cregulatory framework\u201d, and it is known that the banks would like to throw off the reserve requirements enacted by the Dodd-Frank legislation that followed the financial crisis in 2008. They may have the cash at the bank, but may not be able to deploy it because they would no longer be able comply with Dodd-Frank. Or this could be an excuse to get the congress to give them regulatory relief. We know this is not the issue since the banks have excess cash beyond the regulatory requirements, but prefer to place it at the Fed earning a safe 1.5%, rather than take any risk in the repo market is rates there are inadequate to compensate them for the additional risk they take. The banks could be seeing credit worthiness issues at banks wanting loans in the repo market and won\u2019t lend to them. That happened in the financial crisis and caused the insolvency of several institutions that were then sold for pennies on the dollar. That may not be a problem, but if it was, nobody will tell us before they must, because it would cause a panic and the bankers hate that. The problems in the financial crisis were well known for months but the public was not informed until it actually blew up. I don\u2019t expect this is the problem, but one must consider all the possibilities when you know the officials are perfectly happy to keep you in the dark when there is a problem brewing. I am a fiscal conservative and trillion-dollar-a-year deficits bother me. I worry that this imbalance of debt will ripple into the economy and cause bigger problems. Should the Fed use unusual means to float the obscene US debt, or let the market deal with the situation? Dealing with it would mean letting interest rates rise to levels that people would be willing to buy the bonds, instead of having the Fed buy the bonds. Of course if interest rates were allowed to rise naturally to levels where individuals would want to buy the bonds, it would slow down the economy, and probably cause a recession. The question becomes, is it the job of the Fed to prevent all recessions? The answer is \u201cno\u201d. We have had recessions, such as 1981, where the Fed raised interest rates very high to kill persistent high inflation. The recession was painful, but high inflation was killed and it set the stage for 20 years of growth without inflation. Sometimes you only have a choice between a bad option and a worse option and you have to pick the one that is the least bad. When the Fed artificially props up the economy and does not allow minor recessions to occur, when it no longer can sustain the artificiality in the economy, my experience says that the resulting recession is bigger and worse than normal recessions. I don\u2019t think it is around the corner, but I also do not like all the artificial props I see in today\u2019s economy.\nForgive me for my length on the repo market, but it is complex and none of us know a great deal about it, for sure not in any detail. So, I read and try to educate myself as we go, and I will share what I find with you. Is the problem Dodd-Frank, or is the problem the size of the US deficit and the bankers are using it as an excuse to get the Dodd-Frank regulations eliminated?\nTechnical Analysis: The market was up 3% for the week after closing at a new record high on the S&P on Thursday.\nTechnically the market looks good, having recovered from its two week correction. RSI at the top of the chart moved up and closed in the upper part of the neutral range at 60. Momentum shown by MACD at the bottom of the chart looks like it has formed a base and started to move sideways, and improvement over its recent fall. The price action is positive, climbing back up into the more quickly ascending channel formed by the two black lines. The faster rising black channel started in October. Is it a coincidence that it started right after the Fed began injecting cash to support the repo market lending activity? The Fed continues to inject cash and expand its balance sheet to support the repo market, but why does it need to do this now when economic times are good.\nI went by Factset and the earnings for Q4 that are being reported now are up .7% over the same quarter last year. That is not good, but it is beating the -1% that was estimated earlier. The current earnings estimate for Q1 and Q2 is now +2.5 \u2013 5%. Previously the estimates were +5% and +6% for Q1 and Q2, so the estimates have come down, probably on account of the Corona virus. That will not be good for the market down the road.\nClick THIS LINK to open the chart in a separate window.\nWhat am I doing? The market has wanted to go up regardless of what I think. The impeachment is over, the China trade deal Phase 1 is signed, so everything is OK, right? I am making some small purchases and I have some lowball buy orders out there in case of a pullback. I picked up a little XOM at 61. I am starting to buy stocks that will benefit from the 5G communications transformation, like QCOM and SWKS, and I bought a little TSM. Only SWKS does not pay a dividend. I would like to buy more on a correction as 5G should be a growth market for 3 years.\nIf you enjoy these updates, please tell your friends and family who are interested in the stock market about this blog.\nYour comments and questions are always appreciated, so feel free to comment using the \u201cLeave a Comment\u201d feature just under the title of the post, or send me an email, my address is on the \u201cAbout\u201d page at the top of the blog.\nYou can use the hyperlink below the chart of the S&P that will open a larger picture of the chart in a separate window .

        "content": "Infectious diseases represent an important portion of global public health concerns\u00b8 in particular with regard to the current global outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The challenge of frontline diagnosis in hospitals, clinics and ports is that infectious diseases could exhibit similar symptoms or can be asymptomatic. The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) today announced the development of the world's most comprehensive automated multiplex diagnostic system (the System) which includes a fully automated machine and a multiplex full-screening panel for the point-of-care genetic testing (POCT) of respiratory infectious disease including the 2019-nCoV. (From left) Prof. Terence Lau of PolyU, Prof. Alexander Wai, Vice President (Research Development) of PolyU, and Dr Manson Fok, Chairman of the Board of Avalon Biomedical Management Ltd, present the automated multiplex diagnostic system.\nIn one single test and within approximately one hour, the System can identify 30 to 40 pathogens including seasonal influenza viruses, such as influenza A subtypes H1, H2 and H3; avian influenza viruses H5, H7 and H9; human respiratory syncytial virus; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV); Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and 2019-nCoV. Leveraging the current polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, the system is fully automated from sample nucleic acid extraction and amplification, to signal detection and analysis. The System adopts patent-pending microfluidic and biochemical technologies that achieve ultra-sensitive detection (down to 5 gene copies) and simultaneous differentiation of various pathogens with extremely high specificity. It is also user-friendly, with manual handling not being required throughout the testing process.\n\"Early and accurate detection of pathogens could contribute to effective and efficient disease control and management, and prevent spreading of any contagious pathogens. It benefits the patients as well because timely therapy can then be applied to prevent complications. The existing challenge is that we lack full panel POCT technologies for early and on-site diagnosis, which should ideally be capable of differentiating between different pathogens at the same time. This newly-developed system could be a practical solution,\" said Professor Lau.\nPolyU and The University of Hong Kong (HKU) have established the Respiratory Virus Research Foundation (\"the Foundation\") in 2015 and have since then been working on various innovative technologies to tackle existing and emerging respiratory infectious diseases. The Foundation has fostered various collaborations, including those on vaccine and rapid diagnostics respectively. The former is led by HKU Professor Yuen Kwok-yung, Henry Fok Professor in Infectious Diseases, Chair Professor of Infectious Diseases from the Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine; the latter is led by PolyU Professor Terence Lau Lok -ting, Director of Innovation and Technology Development and Adjunct Professor at the Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology.\nIr. Professor Alexander Wai Ping -kong, Vice President (Research Development), Deputy President and Provost designate of PolyU, said, \"In this difficult and challenging time that Hong Kong , the Chinese mainland, and even the global community is encountering, it is important that the research community can quickly pool their expertise and resources to develop practical solutions. The PolyU-HKU partnership is a prime example of effective coupling of multidisciplinary innovation and translation.\"\nThe research team for this project is led by PolyU Professor Terence Lau Lok -ting and supported by HKU Professor Yuen Kwok-yung. Through collaborative efforts, the team has spent the past four years to develop the System. In the past year, the team has optimised the System and conducted trials on different clinical samples. In the midst of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, the team has also conducted tests on clinical samples using the system.\nProfessor Yuen commented, \"The System's versatility and capability will provide for comprehensive monitoring during disease outbreaks or routine surveillance. It will become a crucial technology for ensuring the effective control of infectious diseases, medical diagnosis, and treatment.\"\n\"This fully automated, quantitative rapid diagnostic platform possesses a proprietary technology which overcomes limitations of existing technologies by ensuring sensitivity -- and hence significantly enhancing the reliability of test results. Most importantly, our innovation can substantially reduce the cost of the microfluidic cartridge manufacturing thus making it feasible for wide adoption. It is ready for mass-scale production,\" added Professor Lau.\nThe research team has received indispensable support from a local biotechnology company Avalon Biomedical Management Ltd for this project. \"We are honoured to be able to participate in this project and are delighted to see this important milestone in the collaboration between Professor Lau and Professor Yuen. We believe this advanced point-of-care diagnostic system can revolutionize the current diagnostic paradigm and provide a powerful tool to fight against infectious diseases,\" said Dr Manson Fok, Chairman of the Board of the company, Executive & Trust Committee member of Macau Henry Fok Foundation and Dean of Faculty of Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology.\nHumankind's modern day battles against epidemics remain a major challenge and it is vital that people keep learning from the past and equipping themselves with the best technologies available. Towards this end the research team will continue to urgently focus on developments to ensure the system's robustness and cost-effectiveness, and to collaborate with relevant parties on clinical trials, regulatory approvals, and frontline applications of this POCT system.",

        "content": "\u201cSeventeen years ago, I was covering the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus for several months as it spread across Asia, eventually reaching 37countries, sickening 8,098 people and killing 774 of them. \u2026 By far, the most important measures to stop the Wuhan coronavirus will be those related to hospitals and how well medical teams can contain the virus. \u2026 Most of the SARS cases in Hong Kong went to two hospitals: One had just a single health care worker infected, while the other suffered terrible losses in both health workers and patients who were being treated for other medical ailments. The key difference? The teams in the better hospital had years of infection control training.\u201d\nOUR VIEW: Coronavirus offers reasons for concern but not for panic\nDavid Quammen , The New York Times: \u201c\u2018Novel coronavirus of 2019\u2019 \u2026 isn\u2019t as novel as you might think. \u2026 Zheng-Li Shi, of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, (is) a senior author of the draft paper that gave nCoV-2019 its identity and name. It was Shi and her collaborators who, back in 2005, showed that the SARS pathogen was a bat virus that had spilled over into people. Shi and colleagues have been tracing coronaviruses in bats since then, warning that some of them are uniquely suited to cause human pandemics. \u2026 When you\u2019re done worrying about this outbreak, worry about the next one. Or do something about the current circumstances, (which) include a perilous trade in wildlife for food, with supply chains stretching through Asia, Africa and to a lesser extent, the United States and elsewhere. That trade has now been outlawed in China, on a temporary basis, but it was outlawed also during SARS, then allowed to resume \u2014 with bats, civets, porcupines, turtles, bamboo rats, many kinds of birds and other animals piled together in markets such as the one in Wuhan, China.\u201d\nFrank Sieren , Deutsche Welle, Germany: \u201cThe scale of Beijing\u2019s measures so far is unprecedented. Only an authoritarian one-party state could have implemented them so rapidly: Some 56million people are under quarantine and air, rail and long-distance bus traffic has been suspended in at least 14 cities. What is incredible is that there have been no demonstrations, let alone riots, in the regions affected. \u2026 The situation was different with the 2002-03 SARS outbreak: The scale of the epidemic was played down for months. By the time it had been brought under control, 800 people had died. Now, Beijing is providing information about the number of cases and casualties almost every hour. Even the construction of the new hospital is \u2026 live-streamed.\u201d\nVin Gupta , NBC News: \u201cAs a pulmonologist in Seattle, near where the first case of the new coronavirus was confirmed in the United States last week, I relied heavily on the city\u2019s hospitals, clinics and departments of health to protect our community. And they did so admirably, immediately acting decisively and shrewdly despite the fear and uncertainty that always arises with an invisible biological threat. \u2026 Just 0.19% of the U.S. budget goes toward pandemic preparedness overseas. Yet any money that we do spend means we mitigate the risk of facing outbreaks at home. \u2026 It\u2019s not just inadequate funding that keeps us behind. Two high-profile global health security experts departed the administration in 2018, diminishing the chances that leadership from within may change these dangerous realities. Which means that unless hospitals and providers are given the necessary financial resources, Americans may soon be more vulnerable to threats like Ebola and coronavirus that pay no attention to politics or budgetary cycles but which demand a health system ready and primed to respond.\u201d",

Hospital - Videos - Reporters Several of the hospital videos have been confirmed by reporters as authentic.Renwu excerpt (via translation): \u0080?Patients - Wuhan - Situation - Lack - Kits \u2026Patients in Wuhan are in a difficult situation because of the lack of kits, which cannot be diagnosed and treated. Similar situations have occurred in not only Guangji Tongji Hospital, but also designated hospitals in Wuhan, such as Tongji Hospital Headquarters, Wuhan First Hospital, Sixth Hospital, Wuhan Red Cross Hospital, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital and other popular hospitals. The patients who were lucky enough to use the kit were called \u201cwinning the lottery\u201d by other patients.In the Wuhan area, kits are also in short supply. The National Health and Medical Commission issued a notice on January 19 stating that \u201ca new coronavirus nucleic acid detection kit has been issued, and all regions are required to strengthen the detection. \u201d Only the first batch of kits was received at the designated hospital for viral pneumonia this time, and the number was...",

However, the child and his mother remains in isolation in a medical facility in Cebu City pending the release of the confirmatory test from Australia.\nBernadas said all they have determined from the first test of the RITM is that the coronavirus that the child got was different from that of Sars and Mers-Cov.\nWhile the samples have already been sent out to Australia over the weekend, Bernadas said that they are expecting the results to be out within 24 to 48 hours from today, January 21.\nBernadas added that they are now tracing all people that had contact with the boy and his mother upon arriving in Cebu, including those that were with them in their flight heading to Cebu.",

        "content": "As the Wuhan coronavirus continues to spread, officials in China are urging citizens to wear masks in public to stop the spread of the virus \u2014 and cities in China, as well as other parts of Asia, are reportedly running out of face masks. But can a mask really keep you from catching the virus? To answer that, it helps to clarify which kinds of masks we're talking about. Because experts don't yet know exactly how the virus is transmitted, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending that health care workers treat it like an airborne pathogen \u2014 germs that can travel in particles or droplets in the air. That means health care workers interacting with a coronavirus patient should wear a heavy-duty mask called an N95 respirator. These respirators are designed to fit tightly around the nose and mouth, and, when worn correctly, block out at least 95% of small airborne particles, according to the CDC . But wearing an N95 respirator is serious business, says Dr. William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University Medical Center . Health care workers who use these respirators are required by law to undergo an annual fit test \u2014 a check to make sure the mask forms a tight seal on the wearer's face so that contaminated air can't leak in. Although N95s are disposable, workers must also demonstrate that they know how to put on and wear the model that they are using.\nThis type of mask is \"difficult to wear\" because it's uncomfortable, Schaffner says. Some people find it harder to breathe when wearing the N95. But \"that's the kind of protection that really works.\" While N95 respirators are available for the public to purchase, there's no recommendation from health agencies for the general public to wear them. By contrast, surgical masks \u2014 those cheap, disposable, gauzy masks that often come in blue or green \u2014 are less uncomfortable. But Schaffner says the scientific evidence that \"there might be a benefit for people in the community wearing [surgical] face masks is very, very meager. The general sense is perhaps, but they're certainly not absolute protection.\" In other words, they do provide some benefit but they're far from foolproof. Surgical masks are just a physical barrier that will protect you against \"a visible splash or spray of fluid or large droplets,\" explains Raina MacIntyre , an infectious disease researcher and professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Sydney who has studied the efficacy of face masks. These masks fit loosely on the face around the edges, so they don't completely keep out germs, and small airborne particles can still get through. MacIntyre's research has shown that N95 respirators offer far superior protection. But in one study , she did find that family members who wore surgical masks when caring for a sick child at home had a lower risk of getting infected. But the benefit only occurred if people wore the masks \"all the time when you are in the same room as the infected person,\" MacIntyre says \u2014 something many families in the study found difficult to do. \"But if they did wear it, yes, they got protection.\" MacIntyre notes that cloth masks \u2014 which people wash and reuse \u2014 are also common in Asian countries. She says there's no evidence to show they have any benefit, and her research suggests they \"may actually be harmful,\" because infrequent washing and moisture retention can make cloth masks a breeding ground for pathogens. Experts note that how you remove a mask \u2014 be it a surgical mask or an N95 respirator \u2014 is also important. If you touch the front when taking it off, you could end up contaminating yourself. As for wearing a mask outdoors in public? Marybeth Sexton , an assistant professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at Emory University, says there's no need if you're in the U.S. or another country where the risk of catching the Wuhan coronavirus is considered low. Sexton says wearing a surgical mask is a good idea if you have a respiratory illness and need to see the doctor. But that's really so you won't infect other people. Otherwise, she says, don't rush out and buy a mask. Leave them for the people who need them \u2014 like health care workers and ill people \u2014 so as not to contribute to mask shortages, she says. Some infectious disease experts have also suggested that wearing a face mask may have some value if it keeps you from touching your face and nose. That's a common way germs get into our bodies \u2014 say, touching a doorknob someone sneezed on, then perhaps inadvertently bringing your fingers to your eyes, nose or mouth. But Clarence Tam , a public health researcher at the National University of Singapore, notes that because wearing masks can be uncomfortable, \"the discomfort might make you actually touch your face more.\" This could contaminate your fingers with any germs that might have attached themselves to the outside of the mask. Another potential downside? \"If you see everyone around you wearing a mask, that also can be fairly alarming,\" Tam notes. MacIntyre agrees there's no need to run out and buy face masks if you're in a low-risk country like the U.S. But she says the calculation may be different for people in a place like Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. \"If it's someone in Wuhan, where most of the cases have been, then there might be some value to it,\" MacIntyre says. \"There's a lot of unknowns about this infection. That's the problem.\" Observational studies found that wearing a surgical mask did provide health care workers some protection during the SARS epidemic. But MacIntyre notes that those studies were not randomized controlled trials, considered the gold standard in research. Tam adds that the health care workers who were responding to SARS were also using other protective measures. And regardless of where you are, there is something that all the infectious disease experts I spoke with recommended everyone do to keep from getting sick: Wash your hands \u2014 frequently. \"Hand-washing for sure,\" Schaffner says. \"Constantly. Frequently. All the time \u2014 summer, winter, whatever.\" And get your flu shot. It is flu season, after all. It doesn't offer protection against Wuhan coronavirus, but here in the U.S., Sexton says, the flu remains the bigger risk to health. ",

Stay to know Corona virus complete information The World Health Organization (W.H.O) has issued an alert across the world including India. Under which it is said that the whole world is now in danger of a virus, which can lead to the death of people. The virus originated in China. And this virus is continuously spreading all over the world. Due to this, a complete physical examination of every passenger coming from China is being done by the Ministry of Health of India. So that this virus cannot spread in India so fast. Corona virus complete information Some of the common symptoms of Corona virus are: \u2022 Throat pain . Corona virus treatment Corona virus treatment: - No type of medicine has been manufactured yet to avoid this virus. But other medicines are being given based on their symptoms. And a whole team of scientists have come together to make this virus medicine.\u2022 This virus is spreading rapidly in humans as well as animals. How to avoid corona virus How to avoid corona virus: - No medicines of this virus are available in the market yet. That is why we should take care of the following things to avoid it: -\u2022 Do not consume sea food.\u2022 Keep cleanliness around you.\u2022 Make sure to clean your hands before eating.\u2022 Always keep hand sanitizer with you. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences in the national capital has created a separate ward to provide treatment in case of any, suspected case of infection with the new corona virus. The beds are kept ready there. Symptoms and treatment of corona virus The new coronavirus comes from such a species of virus. Due to which, from common cold to cold, there can be severe respiratory problems. The special thing is that this virus, which has killed 25 people so far in China, is new. It has not been seen before, 830 people have been affected in China so far. It is suspected and spread from the seafood and cattle market in Wuhan city of China. That its offerings have been made to America. According to the World Health Organization, symptoms of the new corona virus include fever, phlegm and respiratory problems. All the precautionary steps were taken to stop the spread of virus: - AIMS director (Randeep Guleria) said that a separate ward has been constructed for people suffering from Corona virus. In this, patients coming from anywhere in India and Delhi can be treated. He said that all the precautionary measures, including equipment have been taken to protect the health workers during the treatment of infected patients. Guleria said the hospital's preparations for the management and infection control facility were also reviewed. He said that if needed, we have the facility to increase the separate ward and treat such patients. precautionary measures:- He said that people should take special care of hand hygiene as a precautionary measure. And masks should be used when traveling in crowded areas. He said that anyone suffering from fever phlegm and weakness should contact the nearest health center. According to the AIMS director, there is currently no treatment antibiotic available to deal with this dangerous virus. And only adjuvant treatment of pneumonia is done.",

        "content": " At the end of 2019, patients with unexplained pneumonia appeared in Wuhan, China. At 21:00 on January 7, 2020, a new coronavirus was detected in the laboratory, and the detection of pathogenic nucleic acids was completed at 20:00 on January 10. Subsequently, the World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus that caused the pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan as 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and the pneumonia was named severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). Up to February 4, 2020, over 20000 cases have been diagnosed in China, 406 of which have died, and 154 cases have been discovered in other countries around the world. Most of the deaths were elderly patients or patients with severe underlying diseases. SARI has caused global concern and emergency. Statistics of the 41 patients with SARI published in JAMA initially showed that 13 patients were transferred into the ICU, of which 11 (85%) had ARDS and 3 (23%) had shock. Of these, 10 (77%) required mechanical ventilation support, and 2 (15%) required ECMO support. Of the above 13 patients, 5 (38%) eventually died and 7 (38%) were transferred out of the ICU. Viral pneumonia is a dangerous condition with a poor clinical prognosis. For most viral infections, there is a lack of effective targeted antiviral drugs, and symptomatic supportive treatment is still the current main treatment. Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, has antioxidant properties. When sepsis happens, the cytokine surge caused by sepsis is activated, and neutrophils in the lungs accumulate in the lungs, destroying alveolar capillaries. Early clinical studies have shown that vitamin C can effectively prevent this process. In addition, vitamin C can help to eliminate alveolar fluid by preventing the activation and accumulation of neutrophils, and reducing alveolar epithelial water channel damage. At the same time, vitamin C can prevent the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, which is a biological event of vascular injury caused by neutrophil activation. Vitamins can effectively shorten the duration of the common cold. In extreme conditions (athletes, skiers, art workers, military exercises), it can effectively prevent the common cold. And whether vitamin C also has a certain protective effect on influenza patients, only few studies have shown that vitamin C deficiency is related to the increased risk and severity of influenza infections. In a controlled but non-randomized trial, 85% of the 252 students treated experienced a reduction in symptoms in the high-dose vitamin C group (1g / h at the beginning of symptoms for 6h, followed by 3 * 1g / day). Among patients with sepsis and ARDS, patients in the high-dose vitamin group did not show a better prognosis and other clinical outcomes. There are still some confounding factors in the existing research, and the conclusions are different. Therefore, during the current epidemic of SARI, it is necessary to study the clinical efficacy and safety of vitamin C for viral pneumonia through randomized controlled trials. ",

There must be many more people who became ill with this corona virus and recovered uneventfully and therefore, did not seek care.\nThe symptoms of corona virus initially mimic the flu\u2014fever, headache, cough, fatigue and muscle aches. The 41 patients admitted to the hospital all developed pneumonia.\nCorona virus is nothing new. It has been with us for a long time. Corona virus can affect both animals and humans. It is important to keep in mind that most corona viral infections are mild. In the last two decades, there were two serious corona virus infections\u2013severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which both had elevated death rates.\nSo, what can you do? Wearing a mask will not help protect you from becoming ill with any viral infection\u2014corona virus included. I would check that off the list.\nFirst, it is important to maintain optimal levels of nutrients, particularly vitamins A, C, and D.\nMost people have suboptimal vitamin A and C levels. Both of these nutrients have antiviral abilities and are able to support the immune system when it is under viral attack.\nIf you are not ill, I suggest taking 3-5,000 mg/day of vitamin C. At the first sign of an illness, I would suggest taking 1,000 mg/hour until diarrhea develops, then back off for a time period.\nFor vitamin A, I suggest using 5,000 Units/day if you are not sick and 100,000 Units/day for four days at the first sign of an illness. Pregnant women cannot take these doses. (Note: Take vitamin A, not beta carotene.)\nAlso, vitamin D is very important for fighting infections. I suggest, at the onset of an illness, taking 50,000 IU of vitamin D3/day for four days.\nIodine is essential to not only fighting off an infection it is necessary for proper immune system functioning. There is no bacteria, virus, parasite or fungus that is known to be resistant to iodine.\nAs I have written in my book, Iodine: Why You Need It, Why You Can\u2019t Live Without It, most of the population is low in iodine. If fact, iodine levels have fallen nearly 60% over the last 40 years.\nThe RDA for iodine is inadequate to supply enough iodine for all the bodily tissues. For the majority of my patients, I suggest taking 25 mg/day as a daily dose and more (sometimes 50-100 mg/day) at the first sign of an illness. Iodine can cause adverse effects and it is best used under the guidance of an iodine-knowledgeable doctor.\nTo prevent becoming ill and to avoid having a poorly responding immune system, it is vitally important to eat a healthy diet free of all sources of refined sugar. Refined sugar has been shown to negatively alter the functioning of the white blood cells for hours after ingestion.\nFinally, it is important to maintain optimal hydration\u2014drink water! Take your body weight in pounds, divide by two and the resultant number is the amount of water to drink per day in ounces. Dehydration ensures you will be much more likely to suffer serious problems from any infectious process.\nConventional medicine has little to offer to prevent or treat corona virus infections other than washing your hands\u2013I agree with that one. It is time for you to take the initiative and learn what other therapies are out there. Your conventional doctor simply has no effective tools in his/her toolkit for this.\nAs for getting the flu shot? Fugetaboutit. It won\u2019t help corona infections and there was a study which found an increased risk in non-influenza infections, including coronavirus, in those that received the trivalent flu vaccine. (2)\nMy last recommendation is to work with a holistic doctor who can give you nutrient IVs when you become ill. Vitamin C, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone IVs can help anyone suffering from an infection. At my office, The Center for Holistic Medicine, we have seen the positive results a holistic approach to combatting viruses can provide.

        "content": "Amy Acton, MD, MPH, Director of the Ohio Department of Health (ODH), declared novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), an immediately reportable disease.\nBy issuing a Director\u2019s Journal Entry, Dr. Acton elevated 2019-nCoV to a Class A disease. This is a proactive step to ensure appropriate reporting of suspected cases, should the need arise in Ohio. No cases have been reported in Ohio to date. However, one case has been reported in Washington state and this step helps reinforce Ohio\u2019s ongoing preparedness work.\nThe Ohio Department of Health has been closely monitoring developments related to 2019-nCoV in tandem with the Centers for Disease Control. 2019-nCoV is considered a low risk to the American public, according to the CDC .\nClassifying a disease as Class A means that confirmed or suspected cases of 2019-nCoV must be reported immediately to the local health district where the person lives (or the local health district where the person is being evaluated if the person\u2019s residence is unknown or not in Ohio). Required reporters include physicians providing care, administrators in charge of hospitals, clinics or other institutions providing care or treatment, laboratory administrators, or any individual having knowledge of a person with nCoV.\nWhat is 2019-nCoV?\nAn outbreak of 2019-nCoV started in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. Chinese authorities are reporting an ongoing spread of the virus in the community and so far more than 830 individuals are ill and 25 people have died. As families prepare to celebrate Chinese/Lunar New Year this week, multiple international travel advisories have been issued to help curb the spread of the illness.\n2019-nCoV is part of a large family of coronaviruses, some of which cause illness in people and others that circulate among animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people and then spread between people. This happened with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2014, and now 2019-nCoV. These viruses may cause mild to severe respiratory illnesses with symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.\nHow is Ohio tracking 2019-nCoV?\nOhio\u2019s public health system includes a team of state experts, local health departments, and local partners that perform daily monitoring of reportable diseases, including 2019-nCoV. ODH is closely monitoring the 2019-nCoV situation in lockstep with the Centers for Disease Control and is ready to respond if a case is reported in Ohio.\n\u201cThis situation is at the heart of public health,\u201d said Dr. Acton. \u201cWe are working proactively with healthcare providers and local health districts/partners to identify and appropriately address emerging threats like novel Coronavirus.\u201d\nWhat happens if a case is reported? A case or suspected case of 2019-nCoV is reported to a local health department. ODH reports to the CDC and, if indicated, patient specimens will be collected and shipped. Currently, testing for this virus must take place at CDC. ODH will work with local, state, and federal partners to investigate reports of 2019-nCoV in order to identify cases and prevent the spread of infection.\nWhat can you do to limit risk?\nIf you suspect you may have been exposed to 2019-nCoV because you have traveled to China or have been around people who may have been exposed and/or are exhibiting symptoms, contact your healthcare provider and let them know you may have been exposed to 2019-nCoV before visiting the healthcare facility. This will help the healthcare provider\u2019s office take precautionary steps to keep other people from being exposed.\nJust as with influenza and other illnesses, it\u2019s critical to protect yourself. Experts at the Ohio Department of Health recommend these tips:\n-Practice good hand hygiene.\n-Follow appropriate cough and sneeze etiquette.\n-Don\u2019t go to work or school when you feel ill. Stay home and rest.\n-Avoid exposure to others who are sick.\n\u201cAnticipatory action like this is critical to ensuring that we are protecting Ohioans,\u201d Dr. Acton said. \u201cIt is our sincere hope that this virus does not spread but if it does, Ohio\u2019s public health system is prepared.\u201d\nAlthough 2019-nCoV is an emerging illness, the Ohio Department of Health has addressed similar issues in the past including two previous coronavirus outbreaks, MERS in 2014 and SARS in 2003.\nIn addition to the latest work of declaring 2019-nCoV a Class A disease, ODH also routinely collaborates with healthcare providers, local health departments, local health partners, and the CDC to share information and best practices for addressing other potential infectious diseases.\nFor more information about 2019-nCoV, visit our website at www.odh.ohio.gov .",

In response to this situation, and immediately after the occurrence of unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan, BGI sequenced the genome of the new 2019-nCoV virus and successfully developed a Real-Time (RT) Fluorescent PCR (polymerase chain reaction) kit for detecting 2019-nCoV, which can provide results in a few hours and has already obtained approval by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration. In addition to the rapid detection kit based on RT-PCR technology, the DNBSEQ-T7 sequencing platform developed by the BGI Group company MGI passed the emergency approval procedure of the National Medical Products Administration, becoming the first officially approved testing products in China for surveillance, discovery and identification of unknown infectious diseases. In Europe, BGI and MGI will work with their long-term strategic partner Ares Genetics to make its 2019-nCoV testing portfolio available to public health institutions and hospitals for outbreak monitoring, infection control, and epidemiology. Ares Genetics expects to provide next-generation sequencing services for 2019-nCoV out of its NGS laboratory in Vienna Austria for infection control and tracking of pathogen evolution from February 2020 onwards based on MGI's DNBSEQ sequencing platform. Further, Ares Genetics and the Curetis Group will support BGI Group in the distribution of its PCR and NGS reagent kits to molecular testing laboratories in Europe that have the capability for 2019-nCoV testing with reagent kits initially being marketed for research use only prior to regulatory approval in Europe. Ares Genetics is a digital diagnostics company utilizing artificial intelligence-powered molecular diagnostics to advance the field of infectious disease testing. Ares Genetics recently launched ARESupa - Universal Pathogenome Assay for the broad identification of bacterial pathogens and the accurate prediction of antibiotic susceptibility. The ARESupa test is based on the sequencing of bacterial DNA, combined with data analysis and interpretation powered by ARESdb, Ares Genetics' unique, proprietary reference database on genetic antimicrobial resistance markers. The first generation of ARESupa is currently offered for non-diagnostic applications in epidemiology, infection control, and outbreak analysis for customers in the public health sector and the pharmaceutical industry. A laboratory-developed test (LDT) for human diagnostic use is under development. \"The ability to rapidly test for 2019-nCoV with PCR as well as track its evolution by next-generation sequencing is key to contain this global outbreak. While Ares Genetics specializes in molecular detection of bacterial pathogens and antibiotic susceptibility prediction, we are responding to the global coronavirus health threat via our specialized molecular service laboratory and making 2019-nCoV testing broadly available in Europe under our strategic partnership with BGI.\" commented Dr. Andreas Posch, Managing Director and CEO of Ares Genetics, \"Longer-term, we anticipate that adding viruses to the scope for ARESupa will also significantly augment its utility as an aid in the differential diagnosis of viral and bacterial infections.\" ###\nAbout ARESupa Universal Pathogenome Assay Information on antibiotic susceptibility of pathogens is of utmost importance for clinical practice, epidemiology and public health purposes as well as for the development of pharmaceutical products in the infectious disease sector. Ares Genetics therefore has developed a molecular Antibiotic Susceptibility Test (AST) that is marketed under the brand name ARESupa - Universal Pathogenome Assay and is capable of accurately identifying microbial pathogens as well as predicting antibiotic susceptibility via artificial intelligence-powered interpretation of high-throughput DNA sequencing data obtained by next-generation sequencing technologies. ARESupa is based on whole-genome sequencing of bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens, combined with data analysis and interpretation powered by ARESdb, Ares Genetics' unique, proprietary reference database on genetic antimicrobial resistance markers. ARESdb covers genomes of about 40,000 bacterial strains and associated susceptibility data for more than 100 different antibiotics. ARESupa already today accurately detects antibiotic susceptibility broadly across drug/pathogen combinations with prediction algorithms for further drug/pathogen combinations in development. The test is initially offered for non-diagnostic applications in epidemiology, infection control, and outbreak analysis for customers in the public health sector and the pharmaceutical industry. A laboratory-developed test (LDT) on native patient samples for human diagnostic use in indications in which current culture-based diagnostic practice is inherently challenging is planned. Furthermore, Ares Genetics has recently entered into a multi-phase strategic partnership with an undisclosed leading global in vitro diagnostics corporation to jointly develop diagnostic solutions for infectious disease testing based on the ARESupa.\nFor further information and quotes, please register on the Ares Genetics cloud platform",

A 32-year-old Thailand national was reportedly suffering symptoms similar to that of the dreaded Coronavirus. Hospital sources said the woman was immediately admitted to the hospital at 11 p.m. on January 21 and transferred to the ICU with a stomach problem, nausea and fever. She was admitted to the isolation ward of the Beliaghata Infection Disease Hospital with similar symptoms. She left Thailand in late November and also visited Nepal before coming to India. \"From January 18 she started having stomach problem, nausea and fever. As her condition deteriorated, she came to the hospital emergency 11 pm on January 21 and was admitted to the ICU,\" said sources. Sources in the private hospital said they were cooperating with the Government and would pass all the details about the demised patient. \u201cWe are preparing to send her blood serum for examination to Pune institute of virology,\u201d said a doctor. He further added, however even the Pune Institute did not have the facility for testing Coronavirus and hence the samples would have to be sent to the USA for examination. \u201cThe State is on high alert and we have been screening people travelling in and out of India via Nepal border too,\u201d a health official said. The Thai consulate general in Bengal has been informed. The West Bengal health department officials have sought all test reports of the deceased.

Both had mild respiratory illnesses, but are expected to make full recoveries.\n\"There was a human in the household who was also positive for the virus,\" says Dr. Marianne Bailey. \"In that household there was a second cat who is not showing any signs for the disease at this time. The other cat was in a household that did not have anyone who was positive for the disease.\"\nDr. Bailey, who owns the Queenstown Veterinary Hospital, says this could mean the other owner was asymptomatic or that the cat caught COVID-19 from another person or animal outside.\n\"It does appear that dogs may be more resistant to picking it up than cats or ferrets might be,\" says Bailey. \"We believe that has to do with a receptor in the body that is slightly different between cats and dogs that the virus likes to bind to.\"\nFor now the CDC recommends pet owners do not let their pets interact with people or animals outside of the household. Cats should be kept indoors when possible. Dogs should be walked on leashes and be kept at least 6 feet away from other people or animals. It is also recommended that dog owners avoid public places where dogs and people typically gather, like dog parks.\n\"When we do the meet and greets, there are only a certain amount of people who can be a part of that process,\" says Brandywine Valley SPCA Marketing Director Linda Torelli. \"We also require everyone who comes into the shelter to wear a mask. Our folks are wearing gloves.\"\nTorelli says BVSPCA has also ramped up cleaning and that they'll look out for pets with sick owners as health officials recommend sick or COVID-19 positive owners limit exposure to their pets for two weeks.\n\"If there is a case of COVID-19 and they can't take care of their pet, we do have protocols in place where we would have a 14 day quarantine in place for that pet,\" says Torelli.\nDr. Bailey says at this time there are no pets confirmed to have died from COVID-19. She says only symptomatic pets will be tested and that they'll be treated for their symptoms if necessary as there is no known cure for animals either.\n\"All of these pets that have tested positive have mild signs, mild cough, mild upper respiratory infection signs,\" says Bailey.\nVeterinarians have given more than 5,000 tests to animals in 17 countries. Bailey says the demand is much less than for the human tests.\n\"It's not the same type of test that is run on humans, Bailey says. \"Cats have very small noses. To do any kind of nasal swab, I don't know that that's possible. My suspicion is it might have possibly been a blood test.\"\nThe CDC and USDA have no evidence yet that animals play a role in spreading COVID-19 in the United States. Should more pets test positive, the USDA will post the findings here .",

        "content": "The last few weeks have seen escalating concern that a new coronavirus (called 2019 novel coronavirus or nCoV) originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei province will become a global pandemic.\nConcern has been heightened after the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the outbreak an \u201cinternational public health emergency\u201d on 30 January and the number of cases has continued to escalate.\nWhile this is first and foremost a human crisis, there has been increasing concern that the associated disruption to economic activity will trigger a global economic slump.\nConsequently, share markets have seen falls (ranging from three per cent for global and Australian shares to around seven per cent for Asian shares and 12 per cent for Chinese shares), commodity prices have fallen, and bond yields have collapsed again.\nWhile the current situation is highly uncertain, the experience with SARS, bird flu, swine flu & Ebola highlight worst-case pandemic fears don \u2019 t usually eventuate.\nWhat do we know about this Coronavirus\nHere is a summary of information regarding nCoV:\nCoronaviruses circulate in animals but can be transmitted to humans and affect the respiratory system. SARS in 2003 & MERS in 2012 were examples. Symptoms can be treated but there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs for them (at present). Like SARS, nCoV looks to have originated in wildlife markets in China.\nSo far there are over 24,500 confirmed cases worldwide, with 99 per cent of cases in China. But the number of cases is still rising rapidly and more/faster testing could mean many more with spikes in the number of new daily cases.\nSo far the mortality rate is running at two per cent which puts it above swine flu but well below SARS (which settled around nine per cent). And of those dying, its mainly been older people or those with pre-existing conditions (as with common flu).\nAgainst this, nCoV has been more contagious with total cases well above those for SARS (8000) and patients can be contagious but without symptoms for one to two weeks.\nContainment measures \u2013 notably in China \u2013 have been more aggressive and started earlier than in the case of SARS. These include restricting travel into and out of Hubei province and various countries have restricted (and in some cases banned) foreign travellers entering from China.\nPast experiences\nTo provide some context it is worth reviewing past pandemics \u2013 both real and feared.\nThere were three influenza pandemics in the last century: 1918-19, 1957 and 1968. The 1957 and 1968 pandemics are estimated to have killed up to 4 million people. However, the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic was the most severe.\nWhile the mortality rate was low, up to 50 million people died worldwide. With a big proportion of the population staying at home, economic activity was severely disrupted, although this was compounded by the ending of World War I.\nUS industrial production slumped 18 per cent between March 1918 and March 1919. Australian real GDP slumped 5.5 per cent in 1919-20 (but then rebounded 13.6 per cent in 1920-21). The share market impact is hard to discern given the ending of WWI, however US and Australian share markets rose through much of the pandemic period.\nThe SARS outbreak of 2003 is a more useful guide.\nAfter emerging in China around February 2003, SARS infected about 8000 people (mostly in Asia) in 30 countries over a five-month period and had a mortality rate of about nine per cent. SARS had a big negative impact on the countries most affected as people stayed home for fear of catching it.\nGDP in China, Hong Kong and Singapore slumped by over two per cent in the June quarter of 2003. Growth then subsequently rebounded.\nReflecting SARS, Asian shares fell in April 2003, even though global shares started to move out of a three year bear market from March. The April 2003 low in Asian shares coincided with a peaking in the number of new cases.\nMost pandemics have taken 6 to 18 months to run their course and peter out as measures are taken to slow their spread (eg. hygiene, quarantining, banning gatherings, preventing travel). SARS ended quicker due to the nature of the virus and rapid action by authorities.\nIn 2005/2006, there was significant concern that a severe strain of bird flu (called H5N1), which was resulting in human casualties, mainly in parts of Asia where people had contact with chickens, would mutate into a form that was readily transmissible between humans.\nHowever, this didn\u2019t really eventuate and as such the economic impact was modest although it did cause bouts of volatility in share markets. Similarly, concern that the spread of swine flu would become a global pandemic rattled share markets for a while around April 2009, and Ebola did the same in 2014, but both quickly faded.\nThe economic and financial impact of nCoV\nAfter strong double-digit gains over the last year and with investor sentiment pushing up to high levels indicating a degree of complacency, share markets were at high risk of a correction in mid Jan and the fears around coronavirus have provided the trigger.\nGiven their greater sensitivity to Chinese growth, commodity prices like Chinese shares are down by more and the Australian dollar has fallen to October lows below $US0.67. What happens from here depends on how long it takes for the outbreak to be contained. The higher number of cases than with SARS or swine flu suggests a greater economic impact.\nBut given the range of possibilities, the best way to get a handle on the economic and investment market impact is to consider several scenarios. Here we consider two.\n1. Containment within the next month or two \u2013 the number of cases continues to rise but it remains mainly contained to China (and Hubei) and the number of new cases starts to peak in the next month or so. This would allow travel restrictions to be removed by the June quarter. Under this scenario:\nGDP in China and parts of Asia would likely take a two to three per cent hit (taking Chinese GDP growth from six per cent year on year in the December quarter to three to four per cent yoy in the current quarter) as workers stay home and travel dries up. With the Chinese economy now being four times the share of global GDP it was at the time of SARS, this along with some drag on growth in developed countries would knock world growth to around 2.5 per cent year on year (from around three per cent). However, growth would rebound in the June quarter as travel restrictions are removed and things return to normal.\nAustralian growth could see a 0.2 per cent hit in the current quarter mainly due to the loss of Chinese tourists (which account for 20 per cent of tourism earnings and 0.2 per cent of GDP) but also lower raw material demand and an impact on confidence. With the bushfire impact this could see GDP contract, but growth would rebound in the June quarter.\nAgainst this background share markets, commodity prices and the $A could still fall a bit further in the near term but would quickly rebound by the June quarter. Easier than otherwise monetary and fiscal policies - with more stimulus measures already announced in China - would aid this.\n2. Global pandemic \u2013 the number of cases continues to escalate beyond China and aren\u2019t contained until say mid-year.\nThis scenario would see a bigger and longer negativeimpact on economic activity. Global travel would collapse. Many would simply not come into work \u2013 a reasonable estimate is around 20 per cent of workers, although this might be spread over time.\nThis would see a sharp slump in global GDP and the risk of global recession. Australia would not be immune and would likely see two negative quarters of growth with flow on to education exports to China (which accounts for another 0.6 per cent of Australian GDP).\nShare markets would likely fall sharply \u2013 maybe by 20 per cent or so - reflecting the huge economic uncertainty. Cash would be the place to be. The $A could fall to around $US0.60.However, economic activity would rebound quickly once it\u2019s clear the pandemic is under control. Share markets are likely to anticipate this. But this wouldn\u2019t occur till the second half of the year.\nConcluding comment and what to watch\nWhile there is reason for concern and it is easy to dream up nightmare scenarios, the experience with SARS, bird flu (with \u201cpredictions\u201d it could kill as many as 150 million people) and the mini panic regarding swine flu and Ebola tell us that the worst case fears of pandemics usually don\u2019t come to pass. Rapid containment measures provide some confidence this will be the case. As such, our base case scenario (with 75 per cent probability) is one of containment over the next month or two. This could still see more downside in share markets and bond yields in the near term, but they are likely to rebound by the June quarter as economic growth rebounds. The key things to watch are:The daily number of new cases \u2013 the SARS experience saw markets rebound once this showed signs of peaking.\nThe spread of new cases and deaths in developed countries \u2013 if this remains limited then markets will also get more confident that the economic fallout will be short lived.",

Samples are set to arrive today (January 28) at a federal lab in Winnipeg to conduct an independent test and confirm the case.\n\u201cOur lab here has been in contact with the Winnipeg lab, but given the history of travel, the contact that this person had in Wuhan city and the symptoms they were showing, we are confident that this is truly a case of this novel coronavirus,\u201d she said at a press conference January 28.\nShe said that the man arrived at Vancouver International Airport last week but when asked would not specify a day. The man in his 40s is a resident of the Vancouver Coastal Health region. He felt no symptoms on the plane or at the airport but on January 26 started to feel ill, self-isolated himself and alerted authorities, she said.\nHe did not go to hospital but instead was attended to by health officials at his home, which is where he is now.\nHenry would not say in which municipality the man lives. Vancouver Coastal Health oversees residents in Vancouver, Richmond, the North Shore, the Sea-to-Sky corridor, Sunshine Coast, Powell River, Bella Bella and Bella Coola.\nFederal confirmation that the B.C. patient has 2019-nCoV is expected to take up to two days.\nWorldwide, there are more than 4,500 cases confirmed since the disease started spreading in December at a market that sold live animals and seafood in Wuhan, China. China has since quarantined tens of millions of people in Hubei province and elsewhere.\n\"We have good confidence in the testing that is done here,\" Henry said. \"It is done based on a genetic test that looks for three different protein areas and then we did, not the whole genome, but a sequencing of the genome that matches exactly to what we know to be the published sequence of the novel coronavirus from China.\"\nHenry said that \"a second handful\" of people are being tested from around the province for the virus and she did not want to provide an exact number because \"it's going up and down.\" The BC Centre for Disease Control will post the number of tests that have been done at the end of each week, she said, adding that the number of people being tested \"changes on an hourly basis.\"\nWhile 2019-nCov is infectious but it is much less able to pass from person to person than diseases such as measles, Henry said. While Chinese officials have said that the disease can be passed by an infected person who is not yet symptomatic, she rejected that, saying that she believes that a person would have to be symptomatic to pass on the disease.\nHenry also acknowledged the existence of a person who has been the subject of rumours on social media. The rumour was that the person arrived in Metro Vancouver from China, felt ill, went to a local hospital to get checked, and was turned away. That person then went back to China and was only then confirmed as carrying 2019-nCoV.\n(Image: B.C. provincial health officer Bonnie Henry speaks at a January 28 press conference while B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix looks on | Glen Korstrom)\n\"We have reviewed that case with the clinicians who assessed the individual,\" Henry said, thereby confirming the existence of the individual. \"It has been investigated in some detail and we can confirm that there is no risk to people here in B.C.\"\nShe then warned the public not to listen to rumours and third- or fourth-hand retellings of stories.\nShe was asked about another rumour \u2013 that the government is somehow involved in a plot to reduce the supply of face masks, and she outright rejected it.\nWith the case of the sick person who allegedly left the province only to later be found in China to be carrying the virus, she did not deny the account when Business in Vancouver specifically asked her about those facts.",

        "content": "Stefan, currently living the fear of the virus as an expat in China, will give you all the tips you need to make it safe with a well-handcrafted list of vocabulary to know. Read Stefan\u2019s story below. How to handle doors checks? Going to the supermarket?\nBy now, everybody should have heard of the newly discovered Coronavirus, which is currently spreading around the world.\nPeople are afraid of getting sick or even worse, and are worried about friends and family, not only in China but also everywhere else. This leads to a lot of controversial discussions on how to handle the situation on different levels, from nationwide protection down to individual people\u2019s lives.\nAs I am a foreigner living in China with (personally, I would say) intermediate knowledge of the Chinese language, this results in a lot of new exceptional situations to deal with. I haven\u2019t been in China for that long and don\u2019t have that much practice in speaking, and there is especially a whole range of phrases and words which are rarely learned during the common Chinese learning path. But being in this Coronavirus situation, there are essential or at least useful Chinese words to know.\nDepending on the city and district one lives in, the experience can be different, but I want to give a short insight into some everyday situations. This is an account of situations that happened in the past few weeks in the region I live (Sichuan \u2013 Chengdu (southern part)) and the challenges they may bring for a foreigner: Door interviews:\nThese can happen often, and the biggest challenge is, of course, the language barrier, if you\u2019re not fluent in Chinese.\nSo, problems can be: None of the people can speak English, and your level of Chinese is far from fluent. The difficulty is here. They speak Chinese very fast and use different words than the words you know. Sometimes, they even speak a local dialect, which makes it even harder. How to handle communication misunderstanding in Chinese?\nAsk them to speak Chinese a bit slower (and hope that they understand you) with \nIt truly makes a difference. When the Chinese speak slowly, it makes it easier to understand. At least you\u2019ll have a sense of the meaning, even if you don\u2019t understand every single word. Try to explain your situation as well as you can with the Chinese words you know.\nThey often collect personal information, so they most likely have a list to write it down. Don\u2019t be afraid of the sheet of paper with all the Chinese characters, it\u2019s not that complicated.\nFirst, use a dictionary with an app like Ninchanese to translate the words on the list. With at least a bit of Chinese knowledge and common sense, you\u2019ll guess most of the unknown words pretty easily. See the list below to know more about them. Main entrance controls:\nThey put up main entrance control in every building which can be accessed by the public. This also accounts for the building I live in, because it\u2019s part hotel, part rented apartments.\nAs above, they\u2019ll ask for personal information. They will hand you a list to write your info down. Or you may have to tell the security staff the information they want. Keep in mind that a lot of people may have already touched the pen and the list before you. So you may want to wear gloves or bring your own pen.\nYou also have to scan a QR-Code and fill out a survey (only once). It\u2019s on your phone, so the translation should not be very hard \u2013 Before entering, you have to do a fever-check. They simply aim with a thermometer at your forehead, that\u2019s it. Supermarket/Shopping center-lockdowns:\nOne thing to know is shopping-centers or supermarkets with more than one entrance closed all entrances except one. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to find the entrance, but the mall or supermarket is still open. Sometimes some small centers/shops are entirely closed down.\nBefore entering, you also have to do a fever-check. Check the sign below that says that you have to wear a mask or you are not allowed to enter. So always wear a mask when leaving your apartment. How does the Chinese news speak about Coronavirus?\nInformation about the epidemic is spread frequently through hundreds and thousands of channels in all media. In China, most of it is in Chinese and only a few of them are aimed directly at foreigners and translated in English. Despite this, with some keywords and expressions, you\u2019ll be able to pick up the general info, as it\u2019s the most crucial info to know to protect you.\nBelow is a sheet which was published by CCTV News . It lists a few common rules on how to increase personal protection. Originally it was only published in Chinese, but I translated it for some foreign friends here, and a Chinese friend helped me to share it. The common rules of safety by CCTV\nI found it quite interesting because it\u2019s visually appealing, simple to understand, and is not explicitly attached to the current situation. It also lays out a more common sense of protecting yourself from getting sick. So, this makes a good starting point to learn some new words and short phrases, which may also be helpful in the future or at least act as an excellent addition to the familiar \u201cGetting sick / Having a cold\u201d-lesson in Ninchanese app. Epidemic Sheet in Chinese \u2013 CCTV original epidemic sheet English Phrases on the sheet:\n",

This is the time for science, not rumors. This is the time for solidarity, not stigma,\u201d said Chen, quoting WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesuson.\nAccording to Chen, despite the daunting tasks faced by China, the government has take strong measures including the lockdown of Wuhan and quarantine of other key areas, which are the most effective means to contain the epidemic from spreading to other Chinese provinces, or worse, to other parts of the world.\nHe further noted that under the leadership of the central government, as well as dedicated efforts from local governments and the whole society, the nationwide emergency-management system is beginning to take full effect.\nDespite the positive outcomes, Chen warned that the battle against the novel coronavirus may bring much negative impact on both China and the world\u2019s economy in the short run under the circumstances of China\u2019s economic transformation and the complicated global political and economic landscape. However, experts from SIIS believe China\u2019s economy will manifest strong surprising resilience; with the support from international communities, the Chinese government and people will ultimately conquer the epidemic and China\u2019s economy will remain robust .\nThe 2019-nCov epidemic has become a common concern of the international community. Since the first infection was diagnosed in Wuhan in December 2019, the novel coronavirus has been spreading at a speed even beyond the expectation of medical experts. In response, the Chinese government mandated a quarantine of the Wuhan city on January 23, 2020; 31 provinces and municipalities, including Beijing and Shanghai, have also taken measures on first-level response to this major public health emergency. The international community has paid close attention to China\u2019s actions to control the epidemic. On the evening of January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019-nCov epidemic a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).\u201d ",

The illness has been identified as a new strain of coronavirus, which is in the same family as the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Most people with the infection are believed to have contracted it through exposure to animals at a market that sells seafood and meat in Wuhan.\nChinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said that the health commissions in China have been notifying people of the latest development and China has been actively notifying the WHO and other relevant international organisations and countries of the infection cases. China will continue to stay in contact with relevant countries where cases have been detected.\nOur Beijing Correspondent reports that Wuhan airport authorities have set up a temperature monitoring point at the entrance of Terminal 3 to check the temperature of all passengers entering the terminal so that travel of arrested persons may be averted.\nThe illness was first reported in late December in Wuhan, in central China. Fears of a more widespread outbreak arose when two cases were found in Thailand and one in Japan, apparently carried to those countries by air travelers from Wuhan. The disease has put countries across the world on ahead of a tourist inflow from china during upcoming Chinese Lunar New Year holidays starting next week. US authorities announced they would begin screening passengers from today arriving from Wuhan on direct or connecting flights at three airports: San Francisco, New York\u2019s JFK and Los Angeles. Authorities in Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines have all stepped up screening.\nIt is not certain that the virus spreads from person to person. Symptoms of coronaviruses can range from fever and coughing to pneumonia with severe effects. A different coronavirus caused the SARS outbreak in China in 2003 which killed nearly 800 people and also MERS, another severe respiratory ailment that has been present in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries since 2012.

The ongoing trade and and the pace of completion on China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects will not be impacted on account of the coronavirus outbreak originating from Wuhan, a high-ranking government official said on Monday. According to a report published in The News , Adviser to Prime Minister on Commerce, Industries, Production, Textile and Investment Abdul Razak Dawood said during an interview that there was still a need to look at how the virus develops and whether it can be contained. \"New interaction on business to business level for fresh trade with Chinese entrepreneurs may be affected but it will also be short-lived as the Chinese are workaholic and will soon be able to overcome the situation emerging out of the corona virus upsurge,\" he noted. Also read: Razak Dawood urges business community to play their part in bringing down inflation Just a day before departing to Malaysia with Prime Minister Imran Khan on an official visit, Dawood remarked that shipment of exports and imports was being carried out and there was no impact of the virus on the said transactions under a trade agreement with China.\n\"Fresh face to face interactions with entrepreneurs of both the countries for more trade may be impacted because of the coronavirus phenomena. I am quite optimistic that China will soon cope with this menace and normalcy will prevail soon,\" he added. 'Textile policy almost finalized' When questioned about the textile policy, Dawood said that the policy had almost been finalized and will soon be pitched before the federal cabinet for approval, adding that the new policy will not outline a plan for the next three years time, but rather for the next five. Also read: PM Imran departs for Davos to attend WEF\n\"I agree that the energy package for textile industry must be extended for five years. Under the energy package, export oriented sectors are provided RLNG at the price of $6.5 per MMBTU and electricity at all inclusive tariff of 7.5 cents per unit,\" he revealed.\nThe adviser was told that the Power Division had started, in new bills issued to the exporters, charging quarterly adjustment tariff and increase in monthly fuel adjustment owing to which per unit tariff had increased to 13 cents/unit from 7.5 cents per unit.\n\"After coming from Malaysia, I will personally take up this issue with Prime Minister Imran Khan as 13 cents per unit tariff to export industry will not help increase the exports of the country, rather it will prove counter-productive,\" Dawood maintained.

I successfully convinced the EU Commission officials and told them about Pakistan's endeavors on progress on four areas of concern from EU.\"\n\"These include current status of implementation of labour laws and more importantly on progress about child labour and bonded labour, status of human rights in Pakistan, and transparent process of registration of International NGOs,\" he said. Also read: Industry workers' safety, health to ensure sustainable development: Razak Dawood\nThe adviser again reiterated that he felt he was able to convince the EU members and that the they responded by saying they wanted Pakistan to prove progress in the concerned areas. He added that the EU would soon recommend an extension of the GSP Plus to Pakistan.\nHowever, he admitted the fact that the EU authorities are also being influenced by India, and other competitive economies in the region, but the adviser was optimistic that Pakistan will get extension in the GSP Plus status after the review.\n\"The EU Monitoring Mission will visit Pakistan in April and will hold meeting with officials of various ministries and Attorney General of Pakistan, who is head of Treaty Implementation with EU,\" he said.\nAccording to the officials of the commerce ministry, the EU approved the GSP Plus status for Pakistan in 2013, but it got operational in 2014. Pakistan\u2019s exports to EU stand at $8 billion, and 56 percent exports of these are possible because of the GSP Plus status.",

Over 11 million people live in the city. The virus is similar to the SARS virus that was distributed worldwide in 2002 and 2003. So far, the new virus has infected over 500 people and killed 17 people. In addition to the stoppage of transportation, companies such as General Motors and Ford are restricting the trip to Wuhan and the Olympic qualifying tournaments were moved from the city. The decision to close Wuhan came when the International Health Regulations Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) met in Geneva (Switzerland) to decide whether it would recommend the WHO in response to the virus to declare an international health emergency. The committee was unable to reach a decision \u0335 1; it was shared fifty-five \u2013 and will meet again tomorrow to review and reconcile additional information about the outbreak. The WHO supports the decision to stop transportation to and from Wuhan. \"They are taking action that they deem appropriate. We have emphasized to them that taking a decision will not only control the outbreak in their own country, but also minimize the likelihood of the outbreak spreading internationally,\" said Director General Tedros Adhanom in a press conference on the ongoing response to the virus, \"we commend their actions, but since we have a team on the ground, we will get more information about the situation and the action taken,\" he said.

I take d The decision whether or not to declare a health policy emergency of international importance for a new #Coronavirus is very serious and I am only prepared to take all evidence into account appropriately.\n\u2013 Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) January 22, 2020 Current evidence suggests that this new corona virus spreads from person to person through close contact. How is good between people is still unknown. The good news is that no cases were confirmed during the press conference in which an illness passed from one person to a second person to a third person, said Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Program. \u201cThe problems that arise are the unknowns, for example whether there are other transmission paths. At this point in time, it is not possible to determine this absolutely, \u201dhe says. At the moment, the virus seems to spread from person to person, similar to other coronaviruses: sick people can transmit the virus to family members or healthcare professionals by droplet transmission, by sneezing or coughing. \"If the route relies on close personal contact and droplet transfer, it can be contained,\" said Ryan. The virus causes a number of symptoms, from mild cold symptoms to severe shortness of breath and death. However, the deaths were primarily recorded in older adults who also had other diseases (such as heart disease) that could have put them at greater risk. \u201cThe death rate is still a question mark. This is an aspect we would like more information about, \u201dsaid Houssin.",

The Committee\u2019s role is to give advice to the Director-General, who makes the final decision on the determination of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Committee also provides public health advice or suggests formal temporary recommendations as appropriate. Proceedings of the meeting\nThe Director-General welcomed the Committee and thanked them for their support. He turned the meeting over to the Chair, Professor Didier Houssin.\nProfessor Houssin also welcomed the Committee and gave the floor to the Secretariat.\nOn 22 January, representatives of WHO\u2019s legal department and the department of compliance, risk management, and ethics briefed the Committee members on their roles and responsibilities.\nCommittee members were reminded of their duty of confidentiality and their responsibility to disclose personal, financial, or professional connections that might be seen to constitute a conflict of interest. Each member who was present was surveyed and no conflicts of interest were judged to be relevant to the meeting.\nThe Chair then reviewed the agenda for the meeting and introduced the presenters.\nOn 23 January, representatives of the Ministry of Health of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, Thailand and the Republic of Korea updated the committee on the situation in their countries. There have been increased numbers of reported cases in China, with 557 confirmed as of today. Conclusions and Advice\nOn 22 January, the members of the Emergency Committee expressed divergent views on whether this event constitutes a PHEIC or not. At that time, the advice was that the event did not constitute a PHEIC, but the Committee members agreed on the urgency of the situation and suggested that the Committee should be reconvened in a matter of days to examine the situation further.\nAfter the announcement of new containment measures in Wuhan on 22 January, the Director-General asked the Emergency Committee to reconvene on 23 January to study the information provided by Chinese authorities about the most recent epidemiological evolution and the risk-management measures taken.\nChinese authorities presented new epidemiological information that revealed an increase in the number of cases, of suspected cases, of affected provinces, and the proportion of deaths in currently reported cases of 4% (17 of 557). They reported fourth-generation cases in Wuhan and second-generation cases outside Wuhan, as well as some clusters outside Hubei province. They explained that strong containment measures (closure of public-transportation systems in Wuhan City, as well as other nearby cities). After this presentation, the EC was informed about the evolution in Japan, Republic of Korea, and Thailand, and that one new possible case had been identified in Singapore.\nThe Committee welcomed the efforts made by China to investigate and contain the current outbreak.\nThe following elements were considered as critical:\nHuman-to-human transmission is occurring and a preliminary R0 estimate of 1.4-2.5 was presented. Amplification has occurred in one health care facility. Of confirmed cases, 25% are reported to be severe. The source is still unknown (most likely an animal reservoir) and the extent of human-to-human transmission is still not clear.\nSeveral members considered that it is still too early to declare a PHEIC, given its restrictive and binary nature.\nBased on these divergent views, the EC formulates the following advice: To WHO\nThe Committee stands ready to be reconvened in approximately ten days\u2019 time, or earlier should the Director-General deem it necessary.\nThe Committee urged to support ongoing efforts through a WHO international multidisciplinary mission, including national experts. The mission would review and support efforts to investigate the animal source of the outbreak, the extent of human-to-human transmission, the screening efforts in other provinces of China, the enhancement of surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections in these regions, and to reinforce containment and mitigation measures. A mission would provide information to the international community to aid in understanding of the situation and its potential public health impact.\nWHO should continue to provide all necessary technical and operational support to respond to this outbreak, including with its extensive networks of partners and collaborating institutions, to implement a comprehensive risk communication strategy, and to allow for the advancement of research and scientific developments in relation to this novel coronavirus.\nIn the face of an evolving epidemiological situation and the restrictive binary nature of declaring a PHEIC or not, WHO should consider a more nuanced system, which would allow an intermediate level of alert. Such a system would better reflect the severity of an outbreak, its impact, and the required measures, and would facilitate improved international coordination, including research efforts for developing medical counter measures. To the People\u2019s Republic of China Provide more information on cross-government risk management measures, including crisis management systems at national, provincial, and city levels, and other domestic measures. Enhance rational public health measures for containment and mitigation of the current outbreak. Enhance surveillance and active case finding across China, particularly during the Chinese New Year celebration. Collaborate with WHO and partners to conduct investigations to understand the epidemiology and the evolution of this outbreak, including specific investigations to understand the source of the novel coronavirus, notably the animal reservoir, and animals involved in the zoonotic transmission, as well as the understanding of its full potential for human-to-human transmission, and where transmission is taking place, the clinical features associated with infection, and the required treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality. Continue to share full data on all cases with WHO, including genome sequences, and details of any health care worker infections or clusters. Conduct exit screening at international airports and ports in the affected provinces, with the aims early detection of symptomatic travelers for further evaluation and treatment, while minimizing interference with international traffic. Encourage screening at domestic airports, railway stations, and long-distance bus stations as necessary. To other countries\nIt is expected that further international exportation of cases may appear in any country. Thus, all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of 2019-nCoV infection, and to share full data with WHO.\nCountries are required to share information with WHO according to the IHR.\nTechnical advice is available here . Countries should place particular emphasis on reducing human infection, prevention of secondary transmission and international spread and contributing to the international response though multi-sectoral communication and collaboration and active participation in increasing knowledge on the virus and the disease, as well as advancing research. Countries should also follow travel advice from WHO . To the global community\nAs this is a new coronavirus, and it has been previously shown that similar coronaviruses required substantial efforts for regular information sharing and research, the global community should continue to demonstrate solidarity and cooperation, in compliance with Article 44 of the IHR (2005), in supporting each other on the identification of the source of this new virus, its full potential for human-to-human transmission, preparedness for potential importation of cases, and research for developing necessary treatment.",

        "content": "Globalization has led to people traveling more frequently and covering far more distances, living and dense populations and coming in contact with wild animals. All this has increased the risk of new diseases called emerging infections, defined by WHO as \u201cEmerging infectious diseases are infections that have recently appeared within a population or those whose incidence or geographic range is rapidly increasing or threatens to increase in the near future\u201d . Since 1970, more than 40 infectious diseases have been discovered. Recent discoveries in this list include; Sever Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle Ease Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Ebola, chikungunya, avian flu, swine flu and Zika. Recently a new infectious disease was discovered in the month of December 2019 in China which is named as Novel Coronavirus Disease. Corona Viruses are a family of viruses which can cause symptoms ranging from common cold to serious diseases. SARS and MERS belong to the same family with associated mortality rate of 10% and 37% respectively. On 19 th December 2019, a number of pneumonia like cases were reported with unknown cause from Wuhan China. Clinically this disease resembled viral pneumonia. Further investigations into the cases lead to the discovery of new virus which was named 2019 Novel Corona Virus (2019-nCoV).\nExtent of Outbreak As of 26 th January 2020, total number of nCoV cases was 2014. Out of these, 1985 cases were reported from China and 29 cases were reported from ten other countries. Infections have been confirmed in France, South Korea, Japan, Nepal, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Taiwan, Australia and the United States. Out of these reported cases 56 deaths have been confirmed so far. Majority of the people who have died were elderly and suffering from other chronic diseases. However deaths of a young man as well as health care workers have also been reported. What we know about the disease features? Scientists and infectious disease expert have studied cases and their features. Common symptoms of the disease include; Fever, Cough, Myalgia/Fatigue and Difficulty in breathing. Other less common symptoms include; Sputum, Headache, Hemoptysis, Diarrhea. The complications include; Acute respiratory distress syndrome, RNAemia (presence of RNA in blood) and Acute Cardiac Injury. How does it spread? The exact mechanism of spread is not known yet. However preliminary investigations reported that outbreak could be due to eating or touching some infected food in seafood market. However cases were also reported from other markets. Human to human transmission is also under consideration given the respiratory nature of the disease, it highly likely that human to human transmission is possible mechanism. Experts are considering human to human transmission as most plausible cause of such an extensive outbreak. It is estimated that each case can infect 2.6 (uncertainty range: 1.5-3.5) other persons.\nWhat has been done so far? As of yet WHO has not given the status of Global Health Emergency to this nCoV infection because of limited information available. However there is continuous surveillance of cases and coordination with relevant authorities in China as well as globally to monitor the status of outbreak. China has banned all outbound flight from Wuhan to other places. Additionally china also closed all social and religious festivals where large numbers of people gather and there is high risk of spread of disease.\nOther countries have also taken measures at entry points where people are screened from symptoms and possible contact history. WHO has also urged other countries to be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of 2019-nCoV infection, and to share full data with WHO. Countries need to focus on reducing/preventing human cases, stop spread locally as well internationally through active surveillance. Global community should continue to support and show solidarity with each other.\nHow can we protect ourselves and prevent further spread of the disease? Although things are not known with precision, however based on available data and information, WHO has given certain recommendations for individuals to protect themselves from such an infection. Frequently clean hands by using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water; When coughing and sneezing cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue \u2013 throw tissue away immediately and wash hands; Avoid close contact with anyone who has fever and cough; If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early and share previous travel history with your health care provider; When visiting live markets in areas currently experiencing cases of novel coronavirus, avoid direct unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals; The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, milk or animal organs should be handled with care, to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices.",

It also provides recommendations for how to prepare patients for treatment and address their pregnancy thoughts and concerns during COVID-19.\nIn March, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) released a set of recommendations, suggesting that fertility providers suspend all non-urgent surgeries and procedures. Since its initial recommendations, the ASRM has given fertility providers greater autonomy, affirming its trust in the physicians to consult with their patients and decide together on the best course of action during these challenging times.\nDesigned to be used in conjunction with other resources provided by ASRM, as well as leading national health authorities including the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FPA Toolkit is meant to serve as a practical, pragmatic tool that clinics can adopt as they begin to consider seeing new patients.\n\"Fertility patients undergo a tremendous amount of physical and emotional stress and this has only been compounded by the concerns and complexities of COVID-19, especially for those who've had to abruptly suspend or delay treatment,\" says Michael Alper , Medical Director & President, Boston IVF and a member of the FPA COVID-19 Task Force. \"It is our hope that, through the FPA Toolkit, we can help practitioners navigate this new world and provide our patients with compassionate care in a setting that promotes health and safety for all parties and responsibly addresses the needs and concerns of our patients.\"\nThe FPA and fertility community are deeply committed to the safety of its patients, staff, and the families it seeks to build. The organization will continue to evaluate safety protocols as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves. Its goal is to promote the creation of a safe environment for the continuation of fertility care, while following guidelines for infection prevention and control and to reduce or eliminate the risk of virus transmission.\n\"The launch of the new FPA Toolkit is one way our organization can help practitioners continue their commitment to helping patients realize their dreams of having a family,\" says TJ Farnsworth, Founder and CEO of Inception and Founder of the FPA. \"These recommendations will bring patients closer to their ultimate goal of having a healthy a baby, while ensuring their safety, as well as the safety of physicians and staff.\"\nAbout The Fertility Providers Alliance\nThe Fertility Providers Alliance (FPA) represents over 450 fertility specialists who provide care to tens of thousands of patients per year in the United States . As leaders in the fertility industry, the members of the FPA have come together to reshape the delivery of fertility care.

Brian Kemp .\nIt\u2019s well within a local leader\u2019s purview, however, to \u201curge, advise, encourage and implore\u201d folks to take additional precautions. And Thurmond did so Thursday.\nIn a new executive order, Thurmond repeated those five words over and over again while laying out what he hopes will be an effective pandemic \u201ctransition plan\u201d for DeKalb County. In addition to asking residents to wear masks in public and continue following other guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Thurmond\u2019s order encouraged owners and employees of the businesses allowed to start reopening Friday \u2014 places like barber shops, nail salons and fitness centers \u2014 to take precautions beyond those recommended by the governor.\nThe CEO said there\u2019s no question that Kemp\u2019s directives supersede any local mandates.\n\u201cBut he does not exempt local leaders from demonstrating leadership, and he does not exempt local leaders from encouraging folks to do the right thing and make good decisions,\u201d Thurmond said.\nMORE: Complete coronavirus coverage from the AJC\nUnder Kemp\u2019s order, businesses that reopen Friday \u2014 and places like restaurants and theaters that can do so Monday \u2014 must follow a series of guidelines . They include screening workers for fever and respiratory illness; enhancing workplace sanitation; maintaining proper social distancing; and wearing masks and gloves if appropriate.\nIn his aspirational order, Thurmond urged, advised, encouraged and implored DeKalb County businesses to go a few steps further.\nThe order asked business owners not only to encourage symptomatic employees to stay home, but to allow workers who have a symptomatic individual in their household to stay home as well. It also asks business owners to consider expanding paid leave policies to alleviate the economic pressure for sick employees to show up at work.\nIn addition, the order asked businesses to provide employees with as much personal protective equipment as possible; to encourage patrons to wear masks; and to clean and sanitize public restrooms between each use.\nSome Georgia leaders were supportive of Kemp\u2019s decision to try and start reopening the economy, which he announced Monday. Marietta\u2019s mayor said he was going to get a haircut and hit the gym as soon as possible.\nMany more, though, were skeptical . Leaders from Albany to Augusta said it was too soon \u2014 as did President Donald Trump .\nEarlier in the week, Thurmond questioned Kemp\u2019s decision to start loosening virus-related restrictions on certain businesses, saying he was praying it was the right plan but \u201cpreparing for the potential that it may have been a mistake.\u201d\nThursday\u2019s executive order was part of those preparations.\nIn addition to urging business owners and employees to take additional precautions, Thurmond asked DeKalb County houses of worship to continue sticking to remote services.\nIt also asked for the state to develop and implement a more robust testing and tracing program \u2014 and for the governor and others to \u201cassist and support a rigorous investigation\u201d of COVID-19\u2019s disproportionate impact on communities of color. The latter, Thurmond said, should \u201cinclude an analysis of the cause and underlying factors that precipitated the outbreak and steps that must be taken to prevent pandemic infections in the future.\u201d\nDeKalb County has second-highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Georgia. About 55% of DeKalb County\u2019s 760,000 residents are black, and recent zip-code level data provided by the DeKalb board of health showed a significant number of coronavirus cases in predominately black areas of the county.

We have seen so many bogus reports coming out over these last few days about people \"falling over dead\" in places such as Wuhan China, and I have watched those reports and absolutely shook my head in disgust... And honestly, if people are truly that gullible and stupid that they will fall for the crap they are pushing, then there is NO hope for them at all!\nIn fact, I was surfing the internet since yesterday looking for some REAL TRUTHS about this \"Corona Virus\" hysteria, and I found some most interesting reports from Jim Stone's website at www.jimstone.is that I absolutely want to share with my readers.... In fact, the first part that I want to present here blows the Jew spew media lies where they are supposedly showing \"pictures\" from Wuhan China concerning this \"epidemic\" to heck... Here is that article here:\nB M: I just figured out how to prove much of the pandemic story line fake If all the videos posted online to Twitter about people laying dead in the streets are real, why are a majority of them shot during the summer, with lush green leaves on the trees? China's trees don't have any leaves now. It is winter there. That means the videos are random, and no leaves on the trees does nothing to confirm the videos really are of a pandemic.\nHERE WE GO! SOME, IF NOT ALL PANDEMIC RELATED SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS \"FROM CHINA\" ARE PROVEN FAKE\nBUSTED!!! . . . . . sometimes a \"day at work\" ends quite nicely. LOOK PEOPLE, the elite are NOT going to release a disease they can be killed by, the \"disease\" will be in the shot.\nOK, I too looked at those pictures, and I thought there was something very ODD about them... Jim has hit the 'nail on the head' by showing that they could NOT have been taken recently from Wuhan as the LEAVES ON THE TREES are still there in plain sight meaning that they were actually taken MONTHS ago and well before this supposed \"outbreak\"!\nWhat we have here is therefore definitive proof that the criminals in charge are absolutely using this \"Corona Virus outbreak\" for their criminal agenda of pushing their insidious \"vaccines\" on all of us once more!\nI absolutely will continue to show the evidence here that this may indeed be all a scam to get gullible people to panic and line up like dumb ass sheep to be injected by their poisonous vaccines.... So stay tuned everyone, for there is...\nMore to come\nNTS\n*Update, January 24th, 2020: Apparently I have had a few 'critics' come in and try to ruin my comment section by claiming that I do not know \"what the fuck I am talking about\" and that Wuhan, China probably does not even get snow this time of year... Well, take a look at these pictures of Wuhan in winter (courtesy once again of Jim Stone) to see for yourselves that with winter season in Wuhan, the trees are left pretty barren of leaves much like what happens here in the northern prairies in Canada:\n",

        "content": "The deadly coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, in December (and has since infected more than 28,000 people and killed more than 560) could have a significant impact on freight volume entering the United States from China.\nThe extent of the virus\u2019 impact on the supply chain is still unknown, but experts say the normally soft first quarter for Chinese imports to the U.S. will be even softer this year.\nWuhan, in China\u2019s Hubei Province, is a major industrial and transport hub in central China along the Yangtze River. According to a report from DHL\u2019s Resilience360 , Wuhan is a hub for high-tech industries, including chip fabrication plants that make flash memory used in smartphones and computers. The city is also known as China\u2019s \u201cmotor city,\u201d the report states, due to a large manufacturing presence of domestic and foreign car makers and global auto parts suppliers.\nThe pneumonia-like coronavirus began to spread in December, prompting the World Health Organization to declare the virus outbreak a global health emergency on Jan. 30. The U.S. followed suit the next day and declared its own public health emergency.\nDHL\u2019s report says authorities in Wuhan put the city on lockdown beginning Jan. 23, barring non-emergency vehicles from entering and exiting the city. The report adds that \u201csevere disruptions to inbound and outbound air cargo shipments, trucking and rail cargo services, as well as heavy port congestions for vessels along the Yangtze River near Wuhan will likely persist as the coronavirus crisis unfolds.\u201d\nOne bit of silver lining for shippers, and in turn trucking companies in the U.S. that distribute imported freight from China from ports, is that the Wuhan lockdown began at the start of the Lunar New Year celebration, which is normally a week-long holiday for Chinese citizens and businesses when all manufacturing is shut down anyway.\nThe normal holiday period was scheduled from Jan. 24-30, and that was extended through Feb. 2 for most of China. It was extended through Feb. 9 for some larger municipalities and provinces, and through Feb. 13 for Hubei Province, including Wuhan.\nOne factor that is still unknown, says Neel Jones Shah, executive vice president and global head of airfreight for Flexport, is once Chinese factories do reopen for production, how many workers will come back to work from their hometowns. After a typical Lunar New Year holiday, about 10-15% of workers don\u2019t come back to work for various reasons, says Shah. With the virus outbreak, he says more workers could decide to stay home in a safer environment, further delaying production getting back up to speed at factories.\nDAT Solutions said in a statement to CCJ the impact of the normal slowdown in imports on the West Coast due to the Lunar New Year holiday is \u201ctypically felt in the U.S. through the end of February.\u201d\nThe effects of the extended holiday due to the virus are still unknown, DAT adds.\n\u201cThe short-term effect on U.S. imports and spot truckload freight, especially at West Coast ports, depends on whether governments take more aggressive steps to curtail commercial traffic from Wuhan and elsewhere,\u201d DAT says. \u201cCurrent conditions \u2013 including the Chinese central government\u2019s decision to extend the holidays \u2013 make it more likely that the current lull in traffic at U.S. ports will last into March, which is longer than usual.\u201d\nDHL\u2019s Resilience360 report notes that shippers and others in the supply chain already plan for the Lunar New Year holiday break, and during normal years, post-holiday operations would have returned to normal across China between Feb. 15 and Feb. 21.\nPaul Sanfield, director of media relations with the Port of Los Angeles, says it will \u201ctake several weeks for Chinese factories to ramp up production and begin getting cargo on vessels bound for the U.S.\u201d\n\u201cWe expect to see a slowdown in cargo the first several months of 2020 on the import side,\u201d Sanfield adds. As for exports, he says it depends on if agriculture exports from the first phase of the China trade deal \u201ctake hold.\u201d \u201cCoronavirus could have an impact on that, as well,\u201d he says. The bottom line, Sanfield says, is that the Port of LA expects softer freight volumes in the first quarter due to the virus outbreak and ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China.\nWhite House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said in an interview with Fox Business that the \u201cexport boom\u201d from the first phase of the China trade deal will likely take longer due to the virus outbreak. The deal calls for China to purchase $200 million in U.S. farm goods, energy products and other goods and services over the next two years.",

The basic structure of the latest coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is the same as that of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which broke out in China in 2003. Like the SARS virus, 2019-nCoV has been found to share the same receptor , Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Some suspect that these two viruses have been deliberately weaponized, due to a finding that Asian males have five times as many ACE2-expressing cells in their lungs as any other demographic. This line of inquiry is being shut down on public chatboards for being \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d, which is absurd. This echoes complaints shared by Chinese Ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai on Face the Nation this past Sunday of \u201cracial discrimination\u201d and \u201cxenophobic\u201d comments (like \u201cbat soup\u201d). He warned that online discussion of the topic was \u201cdangerous\u201d, for fear of causing \u201cmass-panic\u201d. The 50-Cent Army has succeeded in shutting down related threads on Reddit and elsewhere. Another feature of 2019-nCoV that has raised suspicions of weaponization was described in a study from India submitted for peer review, that the same amino acid \u201cinsertions\u201d in the spike glycoprotein as seen in the HIV-1 virus were present in 2019-nCoV but are not present in other coronaviruses. The study stated that these \u201cinsertions\u201d are \u201cunlikely to be fortuitous in nature\u201d. The paper was hastily withdrawn by its authors, due to pressure, likely from the Chinese government. In AIDS patients, these spike glycoproteins drop off the virus and plug into receptors on the intestinal wall, blocking the absorption of nutrients and causing the dramatic physical wasting that is a hallmark of AIDS.Bioweapons expert, Dr. Francis Boyle is shown in this video saying, \u201cSARS, itself is already a biological warfare weapon and then they\u2026 supercharged it\u2026with DNA, genetic engineering of maybe synthetic biology to add in to SARS, HIV\u2026they gave it these gain-of-function activities.\u201dThe videos coming out of China are harrowing. People are being violently dragged away from their homes, to be taken to quarantine facilities. Alternately, the doors to apartment complexes are being welded shut, to prevent residents from exiting the buildings and spreading the disease.Philippines Senate President, Tito Sotto showed a video suggesting that 2019-nCoV was a product of Bill Gates and the CIA. Many truthers have published similar stories; that the Pirbright Institute in the UK owns the 2019-nCoV patent and that Bill Gates is involved.In response, a spokesperson for Pirbright, Teresa Maughan said that \u201cnot only does the patent in question not involve a coronavirus strain that affects humans, but the institute\u2019s work with the virus wasn\u2019t funded by the Gates Foundation.\u201dThe Pirbright Institute owns the patents for several coronaviruses that affect poultry and pigs. The CDC owns the patent for SARS, having sequenced the genome in 2003, at the time of the outbreak.On January 24th, the Institut Pasteur in France announced that it had sequenced the genome of 2019-nCoV, which matched the one shared with them by Chinese authorities on January 11th. Presumably, the novel coronavirus will be patented by the Chinese.",

        "content": "Hyderabad: The new strain of corona virus found recently in China affects the lungs and causes acute respiratory distress syndrome according to pulmonologists who are following the case. This causes lungs to fill with fluid and air is not able to get in.\nDr C. Vijay Kumar, senior pulmonologist at Apollo Hospitals, says the treated cases have shown that the impact on the lungs is severe. 'The virus is found to attack the lungs faster than expected from the group of corona viruses. This indicates that the virus is virulent in nature,' he said.\nCorona viruses are zoonotic which means that they are transmitted from animals to humans. This large family of viruses cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to severe pneumonia. It can also lead to death. Corona viruses mutate for survival and they look for favourable conditions where they can survive.\nThe SARS CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans, MERS-CoV was from dromedary camels to humans and H1N1 virus came from the intestines of pigs. There are several viruses in the bodies of animals but they do not infect humans.\nMany corona viruses are also self-limiting in nature. It is only those that undergo mutation that are a cause of worry. The cycle of mutation is noted every three to four years.\nEvery year, there is a new strain of virus and the vaccination schedule is based on these strains. While vaccination is a protection it is not completely so as its efficacy is only between 60 to 70 per cent.\nSince the last five years it has been found that flu vaccinations are not working as required as there are many different strains of viruses around.\nDr Mehboob Khan, superintendent of Chest Hospital explained, 'Why do we need to know the strain of the virus? Because the strain helps us decide on the medications that are to be used. Common flu has a single medicine which works for all. But if there is a new strain or a mutated strain, the existing medicines will require different combinations to control spread of the virus in the body.'\nWhen the human body is infected, the immune system fights the virus. While the immune system is engaged with the virus, dormant bad bacteria in the lungs get active and they attack the body.\nThe virus is self-limiting and will die, and it is the bacteria which creates secondary infection like lung collapse, kidney damage or multi-organ failure leading to death.\n",

        "content": "With no approved treatments for COVID-19, Stanford Medicine has joined large-scale clinical trials to determine if remdesivir, an experimental anti-viral medication, works.\nIn early March, when patients with the coronavirus started arriving at Stanford Hospital, a team of infectious disease researchers at the university put their heads together and made a quick decision. Among the potential treatments for COVID-19 , the disease caused by the virus, their first choice to investigate was the experimental anti-viral drug remdesivir. They jumped right in.\nWithin a week, Stanford Medicine had joined a number of other medical centers around the world in global trials sponsored by Gilead Sciences Inc. , the maker of the drug, which is not yet approved as a treatment for COVID-19. By the end of March, the infectious disease doctors had enrolled 30 participants in two trials - one for severe and the other for moderately ill patients - who were receiving the drug intravenously. In addition, another group of Stanford scientists began enrolling participants in a similar, large-scale clinical trial of remdesivir, this one sponsored by the National Institutes of Health.\n\"We brought this on fast,\" said Aruna Subramanian , MD, clinical professor of infectious disease and co-principal investigator of the Gilead trials at Stanford. \"We got everything together in a week and were ready to roll. This was record time. This type of thing normally takes two to three months to get on board.\" Worldwide push\nDuring normal times, a phase 3 clinical trial - the final step in the process of drug approval - typically takes months of planning, after years of research, before it\u2019s underway. But these aren\u2019t normal times. With a fast-moving pandemic bearing down and no approved treatments available, researchers are, like everyone else, desperate for answers, and they have ramped up their efforts to find solutions. Remdesivir jumped to the top of the list of potential treatments in part because it was farthest along in the approval process, Subramanian said. By the end of February, as the virus spread in the United States, there were at least five clinical trials of remdesivir underway. China initiated the first two studies in February, followed later that month by the Gilead trials for severe and moderate patients and the NIH trial. By the end of March, Gilead had expanded to 100 testing sites both in the United States and abroad, and the NIH trial had expanded to 60 sites, 50 of those in the United States.\nGilead recently reported that it is expecting to have preliminary data from the study of severe patients by the end of April. The two studies in China, though, were halted due to lack of patients. \"We urgently need a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19,\" said Anthony Fauci , MD, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , in a press release announcing the start of the NIH\u2019s remdesivir trial. \"A randomized, placebo-controlled trial is the gold standard for determining if an experimental treatment can benefit patients.\" That same month, while speaking about the coronavirus, Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization announced, \"There\u2019s only one drug right now that we think may have real efficacy, and that\u2019s remdesivir.\" Why remdesivir\nThere are multiple reasons for remdesivir\u2019s current reputation as a potential treatment for COVID-19, among them the anecdotal stories that have appeared in the media. While the drug is not commercially available, it is being used to treat patients with COVID-19 through a compassionate care program on a case-by-case basis, with approval from the Food and Drug Administration. In late January, reports out of Washington State that the first person in the nation diagnosed with COVID-19 had been treated with remdesivir, and recovered, made headlines. But scientists are quick to warn against basing treatment guidelines on anecdotal evidence and reports in the news media.\n\"We have had patients hospitalized at Stanford who got remdesivir under compassionate care guidelines,\" said Stanley Deresinski , MD, associate chief of the division of infectious diseases at Stanford. \"Some got better. Some got worse. At this point, we just don\u2019t know. We hope to have results soon for remdesivir, and by then we should have another trial in the works for the next best thing.\"\nAt Stanford, the team of infectious disease scientists running the Gilead trials say that, like other scientists, they picked remdesivir as their first choice based on promising results from years of lab and animal research. Often referred to as the Ebola drug, remdesivir was also previously tested in a clinical trial for treating that disease. It failed to show that it was effective for Ebola in comparison with two other drugs, but based on the study, it\u2019s generally known to be safe in humans, said Philip Grant , MD, assistant professor of infectious diseases at the School of Medicine and co-principal investigator of the Gilead trial.\nFor years, remdesivir has shown potential in cell cultures and animals infected by other coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, said Robert Shafer , MD, professor of medicine at the School of Medicine, whose lab recently created a coronavirus anti-viral research database. \"Remdesivir looks very good in the lab. In cell cultures, it\u2019s also been more active in fighting the coronavirus than other drugs. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s promising. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what the clinical trials show.\" The science\nA coronavirus infection occurs when the germ enters the body\u2019s airways through the nose, mouth or eyes, then lodges in the cells in the lining of the lung\u2019s airways, where it quickly starts to make millions of copies of itself, wreaking havoc on the lungs, Subramanian said.\nThe virus makes copies of itself by inserting its own genes into the human cell\u2019s genetic machinery, basically hijacking the replication process of the human cell. Remdesivir, like other anti-virals, is designed to target the system the virus uses to replicate, acting as a cap that prevents the virus from making new copies of itself or infecting other cells. Whether this works in people to reduce symptoms of COVID-19 or shorten the length of the disease is not known yet.\n\"We need the data, the scientific rigor of doing randomized clinical trials,\" said Robert Harrington , MD, the Arthur L. Bloomfield Professor in Medicine and chair of the department of medicine at Stanford. \"That\u2019s how clinical science and patient care advances. We can\u2019t depend on anecdotal stories in order to practice the best clinical medicine. We have to wait for the science.\" Other potential treatments\nBut scientists around the world aren\u2019t standing still, waiting for the results of remdesivir trials. All kinds of studies are moving ahead at breakneck speed to find the next best treatment or vaccine for the disease.\n\"A variety of drugs have been suggested,\" Deresinski said. \"Hydroxychloroquine has been known for 50 years to have nonspecific anti-viral properties. But for now, remdesivir is our preferred agent.\"\nThe anti-malarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine also have made headlines as potential treatments for COVID-19. The drugs are currently used off-label in certain cases to treat the disease. But with only a few anecdotal studies showing benefits, they have not received approval from the FDA for COVID-19. Reports have warned of dangerous side effects that need to be studied before widespread use. Recently, a small study of chloroquine in Brazil was halted for safety reasons due to high doses causing irregular heart rhythms. \"Chloroquine is being used a little bit too widely without proper study,\" Subramanian said, adding that there\u2019s also a growing concern that stockpiling and hoarding of the drugs are limiting supplies for people with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis who are prescribed the medication. \"We prefer to be data-driven as much as possible.\"\nThe next step for FDA approval of these anti-malarial drugs to treat - or prevent - COVID-19 depends on data-driven evidence from similar large-scale clinical trials, some of which are currently in the planning process. Whether chloroquine is Stanford\u2019s next best guess for potential treatment, though, is still up for debate.\n\"Ours is an adaptive trial, which means that if remdesivir doesn\u2019t work, we can quickly move on to testing the next, most promising drug without any gap in time,\" said Neera Ahuja , MD, principal investigator of the NIH-sponsored remdesivir trial at Stanford and chief of the division of hospital medicine. She is working with Kari Nadeau , MD, PhD, professor of medicine and of pediatrics, and others on the trial, which includes participants recruited at Stanford Health Care - ValleyCare.\n\"We\u2019re hopeful about remdesivir, but we are already planning for what the next drug might be,\" Ahuja said. \"We want patients to get any possible treatments that might benefit them as soon as possible.\"\nStanford Medicine integrates research, medical education and health care at its three institutions - Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford Health Care (formerly Stanford Hospital & Clinics) , and Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital Stanford.

        "content": "The Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is a public-private partnership that was set up to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. The organisation was established in 2017 following the 2014 Ebola outbreak, which sparked initiatives to proactively develop and deploy new vaccines to prevent future epidemics. However, developing and manufacturing vaccines is a slow and expensive process with a timeline judged by most to be too long. During a viral / bacterial outbreak, \u201cspeed becomes very, very important,\u201d explains Dr Richard Hatchett, the chief executive of CEPI.\nAlthough it is not known whether the coronavirus (2019-nCoV) will become a global pandemic, there have been over 28,000 global cases, with over 550 deaths. Most cases have been contained within China; however, cases continue to spread, with 27 other countries also being affected. The biggest concern is the welfare of individuals living in countries that lack the necessary systems to detect and treat infections. Therefore, public health measures are becoming more stringent and the pressure to develop a vaccine continues to rise.\nIt\u2019s been five weeks since the 2019-nCoV outbreak was announced in Wuhan, China, and CEPI has now amplified its forces by teaming with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), one of the biggest vaccine players. GSK is a leader in the development of innovative vaccines and in recent years has developed novel adjuvants, such as the one used in the remarkably efficacious shingles vaccine, Shingrix. This technology aims to stimulate the appropriate innate immunity and subsequent impact on adaptive immune responses to generate stronger, more specific, and longer-lasting immunity against antigens. More importantly, it can streamline the vaccine development process by utilising smaller doses, which supports the overall goal from CEPI and partners to rapidly find a candidate vaccine.\nThe practical outcomes of adjuvant systems enable a reduction in the quantity of antigen contained in individual vaccine dose, as well as fewer doses being required to achieve immunity; these combined features of dose reduction and antigen sparing can have important implications for improving global vaccine supply. Dr Richard Hatchett mentioned how the \u201cantigen sparing effect makes a given supply of vaccine go farther, increasing the number of people who can benefit\u201d; that is, in populations where responses to vaccines are typically reduced, such as infants, the elderly and the immunocompromised.\nAs a result, CEPI is now in collaboration with GSK, CureVac, Inovio, Moderna, and the University of Queensland, which are all aiming to leverage rapid response platforms with the aim of advancing vaccine candidates into clinical testing as soon as possible.

South Africans are also searching for these phrases\nIt seems to be a bizarre global phenomenon from which SA is not immune. When it comes to interest in the phrase \u201cCorona beer virus\u201d, Google Trends says South Africa ranks 9 th in the world, just behind Finland. Also Read Why Stellenbosch University has banned alcohol in student residences\nBut we are less interested in searching for \u201cbeer virus\u201d, where we rank only 41 st in the world. Again, we are just behind Finland.\nThe country that searches most for \u201cCorona beer virus\u201d is Lithuania and the country that searches most for \u201cbeer virus\u201d in Hungary. Scepticism over the Google Trends search results\nWriting in Forbes business magazine, Bruce Y Lee, Professor of Health Policy and Management at the City University of New York, views the figures with some scepticism.\n\u201cDoes Google autocomplete (i.e. what Google suggests when you start entering a term such as \u2018corona\u2019) have something to do with this?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe Google Trends web page doesn\u2019t clearly show the actual number of people who have been Googling \u2018beer virus\u2019 and \u2018Corona beer virus\u2019. So while uptick may seem relatively big, it is unclear what the actual increase in number may have been.\u201d\nBusiness Insider magazine agrees. \u201cWhile the numbers are striking, it is important to note that Google\u2019s search engine is programmed to automatically suggest searches based on popular terms. The boom in searches for Corona beer and the virus could therefore be self-reinforcing,\u201d it cautions. Little impact on Corona Beer at this time\nThe Corona Beer brand doesn\u2019t see too concerned at this point. \u201cWe believe, by and large, that consumers understand there\u2019s no linkage between the virus and our business,\u201d Maggie Bowman, the senior communications director at Constellation Brands, said in a media statement on Wednesday 29 January.\nThere is no indication of a drop in Corona Beer sales. Shares in its parent company, Constellation Brands, are trading slightly lower, but it is unclear whether this is related to the coronavirus. Kiwi bar criticised for insensitive Corona ad campaign\nMeanwhile, a bar in New Zealand has become embroiled in a public controversy after using the tenuous link between the beer and the virus to market a discount deal on Corona Beer.\nAn advertisement on the Facebok page of The House on Hood bar in the city of Hamilton shows two men in medical suits and masks holding up bottles of the renowned Mexican beer, with the slogan: \u201cCatch some Corona at House this summer, just $6.50 every day while the pandemic lasts\u201d.\nThe company that owns the bar has been unrepentant in the face of criticism that the ad is insensitive. Its CEO, John Lawrenson, said in a statement:\n\u201cThe great thing about living in today\u2019s society is that there is a small but loud minority of people who get offended by everything and I can always rely on them to get triggered. So I\u2019d just like to say thanks to all the snowflakes for the free advertising and thanks to everyone else with a sense of humour who liked the post.\u201d Corona Beer in South Africa\nIn South Africa, Corona Beer is marketed as a high-end premium brand and has more than doubled its sales in the past year.\n\u201cDue to consumer demand for Corona in SA we are in the process of evaluating the opportunity to bring local production capacity to the market in the short to medium term,\u201d said Vijay Govindsamy, SAB and AB InBev Africa\u2019s high-end director, in a media statement last year.",
